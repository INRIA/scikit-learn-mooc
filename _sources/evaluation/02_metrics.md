# Introduction of the evaluation metrics

Machine learning models rely on optimizing an objective function, by seeking
its minimum or maximum. It is important to understand that this objective
function is usually decoupled from the evaluation metric that we want to
optimize in practice. The objective function serves as a proxy for the
evaluation metric.

While other notebooks will give insight about machine learning algorithms and
their associated objective functions, we will focus, in this notebook, on the
metrics used to evaluate the performance of a predictive model.

Evaluation metric selection will mainly depend on the model chosen to
solve our data science problem.
