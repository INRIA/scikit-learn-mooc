# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will give an example of a typical predictive modeling pipeline
developed using tabular data (data that can be structured in a 2-dimensional
table). We will present this pipeline in a progressive way. First, we will make
an analysis of the dataset used. Subsequently, we will train our first
predictive pipeline with a subset of the dataset. Then, we will give particular
attention to the type of data, numerical and categorical, that our model has to
handle. Finally, we will extend our pipeline to use mixed types of data, i.e.
numerical and categorical data.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- basic knowledge of Python programming
- some prior experience with the NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib libraries is
  recommended but not required

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

For a quick introduction on these requirements, you can use the following resources:
- [Introduction to Python](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/python_language.html)
- [Introduction to NumPy](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html)
- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- [Introduction to Matplotlib](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html#410-matplotlib)

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- build intuitions regarding an unknown dataset;
- identify and differentiate numerical and categorical features;
- create an advanced predictive pipeline with scikit-learn.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 6 hours
