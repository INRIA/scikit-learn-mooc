business,"The besieged airline industry received some good news today, United Airlines plans to hire 2,000 flight attendants. This is the first time in four years United has increased the number of flight attendants it employs. United Airlines, the second largest US carrier, furloughed many flight attendants as a result of decreased air travel after September 11th. At one time 5,500 flight attendants were on furlough. United finished recalling flight attendants on October 31st. The airline's problems were further aggravated by soaring fuel prices forcing the company to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy which it plans to emerge from in 2006. The new hires are intended to replace retirees and flight attendants who decided not to return from furlough. United stated that it will begin accepting applications November 13th at United flight attendant application page"
business,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 280 points, Friday, to 13181.91, just two weeks after soaring to a historic record of 14,000. Two other major indexes, the Nasdaq and the Standard and Poor 500, fell more than 2% in a widespread market sell-off. Shares of Bear Stearns, the largest United States underwriter of mortgage bonds, fell 6.3% today, resulting from Standard and Poor's altering its outlook toward the company to ""negative"" from ""stable"". The investment banking firm recently saw two of its major hedge funds sink after exposure to the sub-prime mortgage decline. Standard and Poor's report said the firm may have problems, including its hedge funds, that could hurt the firm ""for an extended period."" The company held a press conference at noon, but was unable to salvage its stock, leading to heavy losses in the rest of the financial sector. Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro remarked that the credit market was in the worst condition he had seen in 22 years. American Express shares fell 5.6%, while homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises fell 9.4% in the sell-off which impacted all the indexes. American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation shares fell 52.07% in the session after announcing plans to close most operations and lay off over 6000 employees. The company has also lost its lending license in four states including New York. ""It is with great sadness that American Home has had to take this action,"" Chief Executive Michael Strauss said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, the market conditions in both the secondary mortgage market as well as the national real estate market have deteriorated to the point that we have no realistic alternative."" Analysts say that the weakness in the stock markets and economy in general could prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, consequently allowing inflation to rise, but that it would also support stocks and ease borrowing. The Fed has not changed interest rates since June 2006."
business,"The International Criminal Court has presented formal charges against three senior Kenyan politicians and a radio executive accused of orchestrating the wave of communal violence that followed the 2007 presidential election in that country. Of the six individuals initially investigated enough evidence to prosecute has been found in only four cases - including 2012/13 presidential hopefuls Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival William Ruto a former education minister. Menyatta is deputy prime-minister and finance minister. In the past the rich and powerful in Kenya have often escaped justice. Kenyatta is the nation's richest man. ---- The Gulf Co-operation Council is to withdraw its observers from the Arab League observer mission in Syria following Syrian dismissal of plans for President Bashar al-Assad to hand power to his deputy and share power in a unity government as ""flagrant interference"".

business,"The online payment service PayPal has received a banking licence in Luxembourg, promoting it to the status of a bank. As a consequence PayPal will move their headquarters to Luxembourg. Since 2004 PayPal had the status of an Electronic Money Issuer supervised by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Having an official bank status opens new prospects for the company: ""This will allow us to actively scout retailers in different European countries. With our British licence, we could only do that in the U.K. itself, and in other countries we could only react to requests of the retailers themselves,"" Christopher Coonen, General Manager of PayPal Southern Europe and Benelux, explained. The change will not affect existing customers dramatically, says Coonen: ""We are going to inform them of the new status, and they will have to accept our terms of service again."" He also said that for now, there were no plans to use the new licence to offer traditional banking services, but the possibility was being evaluated by PayPal. Working with local partners would be an option to accomplish this, according to Coonen. The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph speculates that the move is part of a strategy to compete with Google's payment service Google Checkout, which launched in the U.K. last month. PayPal has 130 million users worldwide, and 35 million customers in Europe. Payments via its mother company eBay continue to make up 60% of PayPal's revenues. More than half of Britain's internet users have a PayPal account."
business,"The world's second largest auto parts maker, Delphi Corporation, has announced today that 8,500 salary workers may be out of a job soon as part of a major restructuring plan, which will also include voiding the contract with the UAW union. The move would also shutdown over a third of its factories worldwide, including twenty one located in the United States. Eight plants in the U.S. are slated to continue operating. Those located in Clinton, Mississippi, Brookhaven, Mississippi, Lockport, New York, Rochester, New York, Warren, Ohio, Vandalia, Ohio, Kokomo, Indiana, and Grand Rapids, Michigan will continue to serve as Delphi properties. The rest of the factories are said to either be sold to other companies, or to be closed entirely. The plans were brought up to a bankruptcy judge earlier today. In addition to the proposed closings and layoffs, 34,000 workers may experience cut wages and less benefits. Hourly workers wages will drop from $27 to $22 an hour soon, and will further decrease to $16.50 in late 2007. Delphi previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2005. In the original filing, requests were made to drop the hourly wages down to $12.50 an hour."
business,"On Sunday the representatives of International Business Machines Inc. said that the company will launch its new desktop software system for businesses. IBM's new product is called “Open Client Offering”. The company hopes that its product will put Macintosh or Linux software on a more equal footing with Windows. The Open Client Offering software was developed by IBM in-house, as well as with partners like Novell Inc. and Red Hat Inc. It is to answer the questions regarding the cost-effectiveness of managing Linux or Apple desktop personal computers alongside Windows PCs. IBM officials stated that Open Client Offering will allow enterprises to use the same software on Windows, Linux or Apple's OS X. It will be unnecessary for companies using Open Client to pay Microsoft for licenses for operations because these will no longer rely on Windows-based software. Scott Handy, IBM's vice president of Linux and open source, stated that the company worked together with the open source community and in the end found a way to develop a software that is able to function regardless of the operating system. To create an alternative to Microsoft, IBM is going to offer Open Document Format software that the company developed for word processing, spreadsheets or presentations, instant messaging and blog tools and Internet Explorer's long time rival – Firefox Web browser. The software developers at IBM believe that the usage of Open Client Offering can cut the cost of managing applications as well as maintenance and cost regarding customer support on company networks that require other software rather than Windows. PSA Peugeot Citroen, being the second largest car manufacturer, signed a multi-year agreement with Novell, which is the provider of Linux software, to run Linux on its 20,000 desktop PCs. In addition Linux will be installed on 2,500 server computers. RedMonk's analyst, Stephen O'Grady, said that today there is a strong appetite for Windows alternatives. However, he said, this doesn't mean that the alternatives are to displace Windows wholesales. O'Grady outlined that no one is going to significantly damage the desktop dominance of Microsoft."
business,"Atkins Nutritionals Inc, the multi-million dollar company that supplies dieters with low carb foods designed for the famous Atkins diet has filed for bankruptcy. The popularity of the Atkins diet has fallen sharply so far this year leading to a drop in sales at Atkins Nutritionals Inc. The company which has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Manhattan court lost over $340 million last year. This is despite the fact that there are now believed to be over 30 million followers of the diet in the USA. Administrators were appointed to the British division of Atkins Nutritionals just six months ago after a string of poor sales results and mounting debt. Three million people in Britain follow the diet. Robert Atkins, the American cardiologist who started the diet, died in April 2003 after sustaining head injuries from a fall outside his New York office and falling into a coma. Rumors have circulated regarding the cause of his death, and medical records show that he suffered from hypertension and congestive heart failure prior to his fall. It is not known if the two were related."
business,"The High Court in Edinburgh has today accepted Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi's request to drop his second appeal against his conviction for the Lockerbie bombing. Al-Megrahi was found guilty of planting a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103, which detonated as the aircraft flew over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 killing all 259 people on board and eleven more on the ground. Megrahi has always protested his innocence. Although his appeal was dismissed in 2002, a review found evidence of a possible miscarriage of justice and granted Megrahi a second appeal. He is terminally ill with prostate cancer and may soon be released on compassionate grounds. Today's hearing was attended by the Reverend John Mosey, whose daughter was killed and who believes in Megrahi's innocence. The conviction remains controversial, with the majority of victims' families in the UK feeling Megrahi is innocent while those in the US believe him to be guilty according to the Daily Telegraph. Doctor Jim Swire, a member of UK Families Flight 103, has threatened to sue the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service over what he feels is a deliberate blocking of justice. Meanwhile, in an earlier interview with Wikinews on the twentieth anniversary of the bombing last year, the then-head of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, Kara Weipz, told Wikinews that ""There is no difference between the truth as we see it and the official version of events. The facts are the facts, Mr. Megrahi is guilty."" Wikinews has obtained a statement from Mrs. Weipz's replacement Frank Duggan. In it Duggan maintains that Megrahi should die behind bars in Scotland, casts doubt on the likelihood of a transfer to Libya and attacks the Scottish media's coverage of the case. Dr. Swire has also been contacted with a request to comment. ""The murderer appealed again, and now seeks, without apparent reason, to withdraw that appeal. The court had little discretion, and absent some grandstanding from the bomber’s attorneys, it is certainly not what the Scottish media is making it out to be. It is NOT the key to Mr. Megrahi's release pursuant to the Prisoner Transfer Agreement, since Article 5 of that agreement states that there cannot be any pending legal action against him. There is, as everyone should know, another appeal pending, which was originally filed before Megrahahi's, objecting to the lenience of the sentence for the murder of 270 innocent souls. In addition, Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill must still rule on the request for transfer, a request made by Libyan President Muammar Gadhafi, who has admitted his nation’s guilt in the most egregious case of state-sponsored terrorism in UK history. It is simply inconceivable to us that the Scottish government would respect the wishes of this man. ""The American victim’s families cannot understand why Megrahi would withdraw his appeal, unless his attorneys thought that they were not persuading Minister MacAskill that the bomber was indeed on his deathbed. That is a more likely scenario since they had been saying he had one foot in the grave for the past year. If the rumors of his impending release, fueled by the Herald, Guardian, Scotsman and other “newspapers” were meant to test public opinion about his release, either by Prisoner Transfer or Compassionate Release, then the trial balloon was successful. There has been worldwide outrage and opprobrium that this man might get to go home to a hero’s welcome in Libya. ""The only other reason we can imagine is that his attorneys were not aware of the other pending appeal, and are perhaps taking advice from that legal scholar, Prof. Robert Black, who still maintains that there was insufficient evidence in the first trial and appeal. Black has been wrong about every step of this case from the beginning, yet he and Dr. James Swire are given full opportunity to express their views of the evidence in the UK “newspapers.” ""The convicted bomber should not be transferred under any subsequent agreement since the arrangements for the trial in the Netherlands promised that if convicted, the defendant would serve his prison term in Scotland. As to the application for release on compassionate grounds, this has caused the most uproar around the world. News media, not so many in Scotland I regret to say, wonder just how much compassion was shown by Megrahi and Libya when they planted a bomb designed to murder hundreds of innocent, unsuspecting lives."" Megrahi is now set to complete his sentence in HMP Greenock, where he is to serve a minimum of 27 years, barring any further developments."
business,"In an unexpected move, US Airways has placed a $8 billion bid for Delta in the morning of November 15, 2006, rallying the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 12,251.71, a record high. The offer to buy Delta once the Atlanta-based airline emerges from bankruptcy protection by the middle of 2007 would give Delta's unsecured creditors $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US Airways stock. Delta has yet to file its own plan of reorganization. If completed, the deal would combine two of the oldest and most storied airlines in the United States. Delta started as a crop duster in the 1920s and grew to make its base at Atlanta-Hartsfield the nation's largest airport. US Air started as a mail carrier in the 1930s and has gone through several mergers and two bankruptcies. ""Consumers will have more choice and more reach, and a carrier that has a cost structure of a low-fare carrier,"" US Air CEO Doug Parker said in a phone interview. The last airline deal of this magnitude, United Airline's proposed purchase of US Airways, was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds in 2001, just before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. Management of Delta have not endorsed the deal, stating they wish to prevail as independent. On Wall Street, however, US Air (up $6.64 to $57.57) investors welcomed the proposal, sending the carrier's stock soaring more than 12 percent in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. Investors also were pleased with Delta, with shares soaring 19 percent but then going back to modest gains. If the deal is completed the airline would operate under the name of Delta but nothing is set in stone."
business,"A Nigerian ""free puppy"" scam has been circling the internet for months without any reports on television or on the radio. Just yesterday the Toronto Star reported about a Mississauga, Ontario, Canada woman, on September 10, who was scammed by a Nigerian man (Paul) claiming to be a Christian missionary who could no longer take care of his puppy. In April, the CBC reported that the Toronto Humane Society issued a warning for residents to watch out for the new scam, and to not respond to them. Humane Society communications officer Lee Oliver told the CBC that the only contact method, for an ad about a ""free"" puppy published in a newspaper, was email. After he emailed the person he received an email response in broken English saying the customer would have to pay $500. According to the women the advertisements are published in newspapers, such as free Toronto daily newspaper 24, and online. She saw the ad at Livedeal.com, a website which warns about making foreign purchases, and proceeded to email the person in Nigeria who was offering a ""free"" female Yorkshire Terrier pup. The ad called ""GORGEOUS YORKSHIRE TERRIER FOR FREE GRAB HER NOW!!!"" had a picture of a ""Yorkie"" in a white basket. The seller of the puppy asked the women over the phone to pay $200 for the shipping fee, the next day he asked for $250 to put the dog in a crate, and again the next day $50 for ownership. He did not tell her it would amount to $500. On the third day he asked for $100 for a shot for his puppy. She immediately contacted authorities. ""Are you trying to call me a scam? I'm a family man,"" he said. ""I am a man of God. I am a missionary,"" Paul told a reporter for the Toronto Star. ""Me and my family don't have enough time for baby ... I want a good Christian home for my baby ... I love this baby,"" he said. ""Why all these questions? Why are you accusing?"" According to Oliver, a nearby Toronto resident also responded to the scam. Warnings have not only been issued in Canada but also in the Cayman Islands. The United States also has many citizens that are victims of the scam."
business,"Last Thursday, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) announced the French job market continued to struggle as unemployment rose to 10.8%, the country's highest recorded unemployment rate since 1998. The 0.3% rise in the first quarter of 2013 had increased doubt around French President François Hollande's promise to reverse the trend by the end of 2013. According to INSEE data this had been recorded to be the 24th uninterrupted month of unemployment increases, leaving 3.25 million people jobless. France's economy was predicted to marginally retract overall this year and had experienced a minor recession this quarter due to deteriorating economic activity. The news came as the European Central Bank (ECB) planned to meet to discuss interest rates. It was assumed that the ECB would reveal plans to encourage lending in the eurozone, a significant outcome for small and medium sized business, who employed around three quarters of the eurozone. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised France that they may fall behind surrounding European economies if they do not take action and introduce new economic reforms. The IMF has suggested a decrease in labour costs and stopping tax increases could help to improve the country's economic competitiveness and increase growth."
business,"In an interview with Público, a Spanish newspaper, the prime minister of Spain, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has stated that "" if there is a global recession, it seems logical to expect that Spain will enter the recession in 2009 ."" In the interview Zapatero also described the worldwide economic situation as ""difficult."" He recognized that "" the developed countries are or are going to experience negative growth, and developing countries are also going to see falling growth; resulting in a worldwide loss of jobs."" 4=Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by saying that ""the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part. We have a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are beginning to recover."" Asked about whether it would be desirable to another plan to help those overwhelmed by the size of their mortgage, Zapatero reiterated the falls in the Euro Interbank Offered Rate . Zapatero then claimed that the average Spanish citizen would see their mortgage decrease by €28 a month (€330 per year) as result of the recent drops in interest rate, lead by seven central banks, including the European Central Bank which covers Spain, dropped their interest rate by 0.5%. The prime minister then said that he was pleased with the role of Spain in the recent summits discussing the financial crisis, before adding that he believes the European Union will lead the way in solving the current issues in the markets."
business,"2008-09 financial crisis Porsche and Volkswagen family owners agreed on Wednesday to merge the companies, creating one large “integrated car-manufacturing group”. ""In the final structure, 10 brands shall stand below an integrative leading company alongside each other, whereby the independence of all brands and explicitly also of Porsche shall be ensured,"" said the Porsche Automobil Holding SE company. A task force has been set into place to discuss details of the merger over the next month. This task force embraces managers and representatives from the works council of both companies as well as the state of Lower Saxony. Porsche based in Stuttgart, Germany was previously controlled by the Porsche and Piëch families voting stock. Porsche had previously tried to raise its 51% shares in Volkswagen to 75% in a take-over bid. A special German law grants Lower Saxony enough power to veto decisions with its 20% share in the VW company. ""I'm certain that we can and will advance our partnership in the difficult current year 2009, and have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry"" said Martin Winterkorn chairman of the Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG) and Scania AB. The merger would help Porsche with its €9 billion debt which it incurred partially due to the ailing economy as well as its attempt at a takeover bid."
business,"The US Secret Service has released the first photos Wednesday of the new presidential limousine that will transport Barack Obama down Pennsylvania Avenue next Tuesday as part of the 56th Presidential inaugural parade after he is sworn in at the Capitol. The First Limo - the 2009 Cadillac Presidential Limousine - will replace President Bush’s Cadillac DTS Presidential Limousine that rolled out in 2004. Nicknamed ""The Beast"", the hulking machine is a new model year 2009, modified limousine. According to General Motors, the new ""2009 Cadillac Presidential Limousine"" is the first not to carry a specific model name. The Obama Mobile was introduced on January 14 with noticeably different styling borrowed from the Cadillac Escalade and STS, while the suspension is most likely related to the Chevrolet Kodiak medium-duty truck. Do you like the car? What would you like to see Obama driven around in? Mr. David Caldwell of General Motors has revealed that the sleek black car would include a hand-crafted interior and ""state of the art electronics."" The car's high-tech security features include five-inch-thick (12.7-centimeter-thick) bombproof glass, tough-as-nails tires, and a sealed interior that's invulnerable to chemical attack. The armoured limousine has been heavily modified to withstand potential attacks by weapons or bombs. The San Francisco Chronicle puts it in a proper perspective noting, “a half-inch of transparent armor is enough to stop a .44 Magnum round at point-blank range; at a thickness of 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches, the same material can withstand higher-velocity bullets fired from military assault rifles.” According to spy photographer, Brenda Priddy, and General Motors, the limousine, which has the intricate, dual-textured grille, is also equipped with standard Goodyear Regional RHS truck tires in a 285/70R19.5 size, on 19.5-inch wheels. The rims have a run-flat device (manufactured by Hutchinson Industries). Xenon headlights from the Escalade are installed in the front, while the rear has some STS part. The doors are at least 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick. It carries the US flag on the front fenders and an embroidered Seal of the President of the United States is affixed to several panels in the back. According to the US Secret Service, the vehicle would be a ""valuable asset"" in providing the President with the highest level of protection. ""Although many of the vehicle's security enhancements cannot be discussed, it is safe to say that this car's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world,"" Nicholas Trotta, Assistant Director for the Office of Protective Operations said in a statement. The new limousine is the responsibility of White House Transportation Agency. 4=--David Caldwell, General Motors The Presidential State Car is the official state car used by the President of the United States. It is informally known as ""Cadillac One"". The current Presidential State Car is a 2005 hand-crafted, armored, and stretched DTS (DeVille Touring Sedan) built on a GM four-wheel drive platform. It was first used on the second inauguration parade of George W. Bush in 2005. But the version to be used by President Obama uses a GMC Topkick chassis, while maintaining the Cadillac exterior. The President of the United States travels in one of two armoured Cadillac limousines based upon the normal sedan, the Cadillac DTS, with heavy customisation. Lincoln cars have also been used in the past, most notably by President John F Kennedy. The current limousines were custom-built by O'Gara, Hess and Eisenhart, founded in Fairfield, Ohio in 1942. It specializes in armouring limousines for presidents and heads of state. President William McKinley was the first US president to ride in an automobile. However, it was President Theodore Roosevelt who rode on the first government-owned car, a white Stanley Steamer. Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, was the first president to use a presidential state car that was permanently stored in the White House garage. Meanwhile, Obama's 2005 Chrysler 300C Hemi was auctioned on eBay with a starting bid of $100,000 and a buy-it-now price of $1,000,000. It has less than 21,000 miles on it and is in like-new condition. He leased the car in 2004 and traded it for a Ford Escape Hybrid in 2007. The car was sold to Tim O'Boyle."

The bankruptcy filing, should it go ahead, is to be followed by a restructuring program, backed by the government, intended to trim down the airline, firing a third of its employees, and removing some routes from its schedule. JAL stock has fallen by over ninety percent in the last few days, due to the financial uncertainty of the airline.

business,"Currency exchanges offices in the United Kingdom have today stopped the sale of €500 notes after an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) concluded that up to 90% of the notes were being used by money launderers and other organised criminals. Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA, said that the Euro had been chosen as the currency of choice by criminal gangs due to the large denomination of the notes, adding ""it should now be impossible now to buy a €500 note over the counter from one of the suppliers. And that's going to have an effect on the criminals &amp;mdash; it means they are going to have to find other means of trying to move their money."" The note was introduced by the European Central Bank in 2002, when the currency itself officially entered into circulation. The notoriety of the note's criminal uses has earned it the nickname ""the Bin Laden"" after Al-Qaeda suspect Osama bin Laden — something that everyone knows is out there, but law-abiding people rarely see. The Euro is the official currency of 16 European countries, colloquially known as the Eurozone, as well as unofficially in a further 4 nations. Since its introduction, there has been mounting international concern over criminal use of the large denomination note, which facilitates money laundering by allowing large concentrations of cash to be concealed in small spaces, for example, €20,000 can be concealed in a cigarette packet and £1&amp;nbsp;million in €500 notes weighs 2.2kg while the equivalent in £20 notes weighs 50kg. The highest denomination note in Sterling is £50, making high-value denominations in other currencies, such as the Euro, tempting for those wishing to move large amounts of money. Should the five hundred Euro note be withdrawn from the whole of Europe? When asked if criminal demand for the note would simply be displaced to other high-value notes, such as the €200 note (the next-highest denomination), Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA said he believed that would be the case, however, with less of the €200 note in circulation, their movements would be easier to track than those of the €500. Tourists returning to the UK from holidays in Europe will still be able to change their €500 notes for Sterling but will be unable to purchase them. The European Central Bank has no plans for a withdrawal of the note, given the legitimate demand for it in countries such as Germany and Italy, where cash is used far more frequently than alternatives such as credit cards."

""We think there is still another 100 million sitting around in people's homes,"" Brian Lang, currency manger for the Reserve Bank, said. Lang said: ""So far, just over 280 million coins have been returned, but there are more out there. Since 1967 the Reserve Bank has issued more than a billion of the old 'silver' coins.

The coins still awaiting to be handed in, by either spending them, taking them to a bank or donating them to charity, are estimated to be worth between NZ$5 million and $50 million. ""A last-minute burst of publicity may convince people to bring the coins in. It's a bit of a hassle though. Human nature being what it is, people just don't care,"" Lang said. The Karori Wildlife Sanctuary located in Wellington say that they have collected over $9,000 in old coins. Sanctuary spokesman, Alan Dicks said: ""The campaign was particularly fitting because the old coins depicted tuataras and kiwis, both of which can be found living at the sanctuary.

business,"India On Wednesday, India demonetised ₹500 (about US$7.50) and ₹1000 notes, announced as a measure to fight corruption, fake notes, and black money. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Indian citizens late Tuesday, and said 500 and 1000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender at midnight. To minimise possible difficulties to citizens, transactions using old 500 and 1000 rupee notes were accepted at government hospitals, railway ticket bookings, government buses, and airports. The notes were also accepted at public-sector petrol-pumps, government-authorised consumer co-operative stores, milk booths authorised by State governments, and cremation grounds till Friday midnight. These shops were obliged to have a record of their stocks and sales. In his announcement, Modi said, Aadhar card, voter's card, ration card, passport, income tax PAN card number or other approved proofs and exchange your old 500 or thousand rupee notes for new notes. Modi also announced those who failed to change their currency till December 30 can exchange the notes at Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s office along with a declaration form till March 31. The notes can be exchanged till December 30 at any branch of any bank across India. By Saturday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said demonetised money equivalent to almost US$30 billion was deposited in banks across India. According to estimate, the old notes accounted for 85% of the total money in circulation. New 500 rupee and 2000 rupee notes are to be issued. Modi said RBI would exercise caution from past experience and limit the circulation of large-value notes. International tourists could purchase up to 5000 rupees using the old notes at airport exchanges till Friday. A limit was imposed on cash withdrawal; a maximum of 10000 rupees each day, and 20000 rupees each week, can be withdrawn. Moreover, from Thursday (November 10) till November 24, 4000 rupees can be exchanged in the banks and post offices. The amount is credited to the bank account. Government workers were informed about demonetising when the announcement was made. Modi announced all banks would remain closed for public work on Wednesday. In the United States, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election on Tuesday, immediately after which stock markets dropped globally. Following the US election and demonetising the money, the Indian stock market fell by 1700 points on Wednesday. Sensex lost 1,688.69 points and Nifty lost 111.55 points on the same day. Indian technology sector companies experienced loss. TCS suffered 4.93% loss and Infosys lost 2.74%. The Indian rupee is also used in the neighbouring countries of Bhutan and Nepal. The border area uses Indian currency for day-to-day transactions. The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan (RMA) has announced the exchange of old notes will be facilitated till December 15. RMA governor Dasho Penjore informed Indian news site The Wire, ""We do not know exactly how much Indian currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is in circulation in Bhutan. We will get a better idea after the deadline to deposit their amount"". RMA has 30% of its international exchange reserve in Indian rupees. Nepal Rastra Bank directed all Nepali banks to stop conducting transactions using the Indian rupee. On Thursday, there were long queues in front of ATMs and banks to exchange the old notes and withdraw money. BBC reported some banks ran out of cash. Police were called to some banks to maintain discipline. Banks were open on Saturday and Sunday for money exchange. Shops did not accept the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes. Some emphasised cash-less transaction as well. BBC reported some traders and small business owners in Delhi threatened to call a strike as this move affected their business. eRetail websites like Amazon and Flipkart announced they would not accept the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes on Cash on Delivery orders. Amazon also announced 15% discount on gift cards worth 500 or 1000 rupees. The government ceased all transactions using the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes before Saturday. But a Wikinews correspondent noticed a jeweler shop accepting the demonetised notes on Saturday. When questioned, the jeweler said they were accepting the old notes only on purchase. When the correspondent, who did not identify as a reporter to the shop owners, said the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes were not legal money, they said they will exchange the notes in a bank since there were 50 days to exchange with a new and legal tender. They refused to exchange old 500 rupee notes with change, asserting the customer needs to buy merchandise from their shop."
business,"New York Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has been refused bail after appearing in court in New York charged with sexually assaulting a chambermaid at a hotel in Manhattan. The decision by the judge to remand him in custody yesterday will likely disrupt emergency talks over the European debt crisis, demolish hopes that he will challenge Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency, and spell the end of his political career. In court, Strauss-Kahn appeared sombre and tired. The judge agreed with the argument by the prosecution that the French politician was a flight risk after he reportedly tried to flee the country on a passenger jet for Paris. The defence said Strauss-Kahn denied the charges against him and offered $1,000,000 bail and said he would reside in Manhattan with an electronic bracelet, but the judge refused. Afterwards, defence lawyer Benjamin Brafman said: ""This battle has just begun."" The politician appeared in court charged with three crimes, including attempted rape, after a chambermaid told detectives she had been sexually assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in a luxury hotel near Times Square. ""The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted,"" a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said. Detectives said the politician was detained in the first class cabin of the passenger plane which was minutes from leaving for Paris. Strauss-Kahn had reportedly fled the hotel ""in a hurry"" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. Prosecutors have last night announced they are investigating claims made by a French author, Tristane Banon, that she was sexually assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in 2002. At the time, her mother&amp;mdash;socialist councillor Anne Mansouret&amp;mdash; persuaded her not to press charges against him, but yesterday she told French television that Strauss-Kahn had an ""addiction"" to ""preying"" on women, and had ""a difficulty in controlling his impulses."" The author's lawyer has announced he is planning to file a complaint with Banon to officials about the alleged attack. Kahn can be convicted and sentenced over the alleged attacks on the chambermaid and on Banon because he does not have diplomatic immunity. Strauss-Kahn was considered a serious contender and was expected to announce his candidacy against Sarkozy this month, but the allegations are expected to destroy the hopes of his supporters, increase infighting among the French left, and leave his political career in tatters. His arrest comes at a critical moment for the IMF, and will likely plunge efforts to stabilise the financial states of struggling eurozone countries into chaos. Strauss-Kahn was meant to discuss the bailouts of Greece and Portugal with European Union financial officials at a meeting in Brussels this week."
business,"Apple is being accused of anti-gay discrimination after it made available a free app for the iPhone and iPad that aims to help ""homosexual strugglers"" through bible teaching. The app was released in mid-February by Exodus International, a Christian ministry that wants to provide a ""refuge for people looking for help in their journey out of homosexuality."" To date, over 130,000 people have signed a petition requesting Apple to withdraw the app. The app was developed by Exodus International. The statement on its website says, ""Exodus is a Christian ministry that supports those wanting to reconcile their faith with their sexual behavior."" It stresses that Apple has given the app a ""4+"" rating meaning it contains ""no objectionable content."" The app gives users ""freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus"", according to the group. Truth Wins Out, a gay rights activist group that campaigns against ""ex-gay"" ministries encouraging people to change their sexual orientation, launched a petition on the website of change.org requesting that Apple remove the app. It accuses Exodus of using ""scare tactics, misinformation, stereotypes and distortions of LGBT life to recruit clients."" It says Exodus is attempting to reach young people with a message that is especially ""dangerous"" in light of recent suicides of LGBT youth. Wayne Besen, leader of Truth Wins Out, says the message of Exodus International constitutes hate speech. Jeff Buchanan of Exodus International, said the app is intended to reach those that share the church's beliefs. ""We are reaching those with unwanted same sex attraction,"" he said. ""We were disappointed to see this petition. What we're asking for is fair and equal representation on the Apple platform. We see this as a religious freedom."" The issue highlights the problems Apple faces if it becomes involved in policing the content of the countless religious apps in its store, any of which has the potential to be offensive to someone. ""It's an issue of tolerance,"" Buchanan said. ""We're simply asking that we have the same opportunity to voice our message as others."" Apple is well known for strictly monitoring the content of the apps offered to users of its gadgets, and excludes sexually explicit material, offensive speech and images, and last November banned an app that entreated users to speak out against gay marriage."
business,"Sources close to three distributors of the GNU/Linux operating systems have announced that Progeny, Mandriva and TurboLinux are working together on a new Enterprise Linux distribution in the hope of competing with Novell's and Red Hat's products. The new distribution will be Debian-based, making it the first Debian-based enterprise Linux distribution. According to eWeek, the distribution will support both Debian's native .deb package format (including APT) and Red Hat's original RPM system, in order to remain compatible with the many Red Hat-based enterprise distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE — according to one vendor, ""Basically the objective is to produce a distro that can act like Debian, use the Debian repository, but any Red Hat engineer should be comfortable with it."" The distribution will also include a (within Debian) pioneering Web-based service manager for easy system administration, comparable to RHEL's tools of late."

""Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession,"" he said, speaking to Members of Parliament (MPs). ""There will be a recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too,"" he continued. These comments echo those made recently by Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England. Leader of the opposition David Cameron said that Brown should take some of the blame for the crisis. ""He claimed the credit in the boom, why won't he take responsibility in the bust?"" Sushil Wadhwani, who was formerly a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee also reacted to these recent comments. ""The committee has been too slow to acknowledge the risks of a recession and they have fallen behind the curve,"" he said. ""The consequence of their relative inactivity so far is that the recession is likely to be deeper and more prolonged than was necessary."" Markets today continued to fall dramatically. As of 15:30 UTC, the FTSE 100 index had fallen by 152.18 point to a value of 4077.55, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 9,000 with a 2.89% drop. Are we entering a recession?

business,"commonsurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/180107_2200_newsbriefs.ogg An EU Commission-funded research studied costs and benefits of adopting open source software, such as Linux or OpenOffice.org instead of proprietary software such as Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. The study was conducted on six organizations from European nations. The study concluded that: in almost all the cases, a transition toward open source reports of savings on the long-term costs of ownership of the software products. In addition, Costs to migrate to an open solution are relevant and an organization needs to consider an extra effort for this. However these costs are temporary and mainly are budgeted in less than one year. The major factor of cost of the new solution – even in the case that the open solution is mixed with closed software – is costs for peer or ad hoc training. These are the best example of intangible costs that often are not foreseen in a transition. On the other hand not providing a specific training may cause an adverse attitude toward the new technology. Fortunately those costs are limited in time and are not strictly linked to the nature of the new software adopted. The study also reported that they found ""no particular delays or lost of time in the daily work due to the use of OpenOffice.org"" (p. 283) instead of Microsoft Office. This is bad news for Microsoft, who is in a legal battle with European Union over its monopolist behaviors. It is also competing with a number of open source software distributors for the market. Microsoft recently released an update to its popular operating system Windows, as well as to its browser Internet Explorer and its office productivity suite Microsoft Office. These products are competing with distributors such as Red Hat, Firefox, and OpenOffice.org."

business,"Lehman Brothers, a major American investment banker, has filed paperwork for bankruptcy. It would be the largest collapse of an investment firm in 18 years. Lehman attempted to find a buyer over the weekend but it met with no success. The last remaining bidder, Barclays PLC bank pulled out Sunday afternoon. Barclays, a United Kingdom-based bank, had become the sole bidder after a consortium led by Bank of America pulled out early Sunday morning citing that it would need government support before considering a bid. The support would consist of backing bad debts owed by Lehman. Barclays cited a similar reason for withdrawing its bid. As of Monday morning, no buyer has come through to take control of the firm. As a result, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection. Should government money be used in helping support Lehman Brothers? The main sticking point for potential buyers appears to be the unwillingness for the U.S. government to provide financial support. Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that no government money will be given to Lehman or used in any takeover the firm. Government money was used in the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase in March of this year. Bear Stearns suffered similar problems as Lehman. A spokesmen for Barclays told the Financial Times, ""the proposed transaction required a guarantee for the trading operations of Lehman Brothers that was potentially open-ended, and we were not willing to provide that guarantee."" Paulson, along with other government officials, proposed a solution that Lehman would get split into two separate entities. However, this proposal has been discarded by many of Wall Street banks. Members of the G8 have reportedly been keep abreast of the situation by U.S. government. The firm, which has over 25,000 staffers, has suffered bad results due to the subprime mortgage crisis."

business,"The Group of 20 (G20) of the world's leading developed and developing countries' finance ministers agreed on Saturday to pursue a plan that would avoid dangerous currency devaluations and would also would attempt to reduce trade imbalances. The plan was introduced by the United States, and the G20 meeting was held in South Korea. The plan was announced amid rising worries of a ""currency war"" that would lead to devalued currencies in order to get an export advantage and would damage the global economy. ""Our cooperation is essential. We are all committed to play our part in achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth in a collaborative and coordinated way,"" a statement released by the G20 said. On the topic of trade imbalances, the G-20 stated that ""excessive imbalances"" would be ""assessed against indicative guidelines to be agreed."" This statement was weaker than a commitment proposed by United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, which would keep trade imbalances ""below a specified share"" of GDP for the next few years. This proposal was met with strong opposition from export-based economies such as Japan, whose Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda argued that specific targets were ""unrealistic"", but approved of unspecific ""guidelines"". He added: ""There are many perspectives on the current account issue. Every country has a different situation when it comes to surpluses and deficits. So we need to study this carefully."" The United States said that they will continue to push for numerical targets and specific time frames at next month's South Korean summit, where the heads of state of the G20 will convene. ""If the world is going to be able to grow at a strong, sustainable pace in the future . . . then we need to work to achieve more balance in the pattern of global growth as we recover from the crisis,"" US Treasury Secretary Geithner declared. The finance ministers also set China on the track to floating its currency more, and overhauling the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to give more representation to developing powers such as China and India. The G20 was created in 1999, includes both developed and developing countries, and represents 85% of the world's economy. The G20's heads of state will meet in Seoul, South Korea, next month."
business,"The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the regulatory authority for Great Britain's railway network, has launched an investigation of Network Rail procedures following a complaint from Virgin Trains regarding over-running engineering works on New Year's Eve. Network Rail, who are responsible for the British railway infrastructure, have announced that as part of ongoing engineering work to improve the West Coast Main Line, no services will be able to pass through Rugby on December 31. The closure will affect services operated by Virgin Trains, London Midland and First ScotRail. Chris Gibb, the Managing Director of Virgin Trains said, ""I am very disappointed that Network Rail (NR) has given us so little opportunity to warn our passengers of this further disruption. We were first warned of the possibility of this additional work on 6 December."" ""Because of the seriousness of the situation we felt it necessary to refer the matter to the Office of Rail Regulation. We simply cannot have NR bullying train operators in this way just because their engineering planning processes are in a mess."" The company has warned passengers that journeys are likely to be extended by an hour or more in some cases. Whilst the ORR will be investigating the complaint from Virgin, they have ruled that the work should still go ahead. A spokesman for Network Rail said, ""Work will be ongoing for most of the next year, but the Christmas period is the last major opportunity we have to do key work while passenger numbers are down during the relatively long holiday period. ""It was only realised at the beginning of December that work was falling behind. Rail companies are usually given 12 weeks notice of engineering work. Virgin were told only at the beginning of the month, so that is very late. ""Network Rail is extremely sorry and apologises to passengers for the inconvenience."" According to the company, the engineering works will contribute to enabling increases in service frequencies and reductions in journey times on the West Coast Main Line from December 2008."

Not including special items, the firm said it had lost a net $5.9 billion dollars, or $9.66 per share. In the first quarter of last year, GM had reported a loss of $381 million, or $0.67 per share. Most financial analysts had forecast the automaker's losses to be over $6.7 billion, or $11.05 per share. GM had also reported that it had spent $10.2 billion in an effort to prevent bankruptcy. The manufacturer has received over $15 billion in bailout money from the federal government. The company has a deadline set at June 1 to draw up a restructuring plan. If it doesn't do so by then, it will be obliged to file for bankruptcy protection. ""We're focusing very much on the cost side of the business but once you start losing revenues you get into a vicious circle from which you can't recover,"" said Ray Young, the chief financial officer for GM. ""We continue to see a 60-80 percent chance of a GM bankruptcy.

The Central Bank is encouraging the nations top banks to provide the money to smaller lenders. Central Bank chairman Sergei Ignatiev also announced on Wednesday that mandatory reserve requirements for banks would be slashed, freeing up an additional 300 billion ruble.

business,"France has banned use of the Skype PC telephony application in Universities. The exact reason is unclear, but state security was one of the reasons given by the authorities responsible. Several other possible reasons have been cited including fears of research secrets being handed over to the United States and the fact that in order to make calls to the public phone network you pay a company in Luxembourg and not the local phone company. The Skype software uses an encryption algorithm that makes it next to impossible to monitor calls; this is frequently cited as China's reason for banning the application. Some media reports have suggested that French authorities are fearful that whilst they were unable to monitor calls made with Skype, they might be monitored by the US. However, this version of facts, which has spread like wildfire, was promptly refuted by French authorities who called attention to the fact that the ban only applies to university research centers and laboratories, and not to the general student and faculty population. The real reasons behind the ban remains a hot point of debate and controversy, although public opinion in France is not sympathetic to Skype's new profile. Skype has recently been purchased by eBay, which the French consider a mammoth e-company with questionable practices and a dubious reputation."

business,"The United States Federal Aviation Administration has issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive to all owners and operators of certain Next Generation Boeing 737s to inspect their aircraft in light of recent developments in the investigation of the recent China Airlines explosion. The measures have been imposed due to the discovery that a structural bolt in the aircraft that exploded had come loose and punched a hole in the aircraft's right wing fuel tank. It is thought the bolt came loose after a worker failed to replace a washer after a routine maintenance procedure several months prior to the accident. Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx said ""This was determined to be an issue of flight safety... It's very, very important."" Operators must complete an initial inspection of the wing slat assemblies of the affected aircraft in ten days, and must ensure the fasteners are properly torqued within 24 days. They must then repeat the inspections every 3,000 flight cycles thereafter. The directive is believed to affect over 2,000 aircraft worldwide."
business,"Despite the passage of a 700 billion USD bill by the United States House of Representatives on Friday and the Senate on Wednesday, two U.S. states may need loans totaling over 14 billion dollars. California and Massachusetts are seeking at least 7 billion dollars each from the federal government as loans. Officials and lawmakers in both states say that the loans would be temporary. According to Massachusetts' state treasurer, Timothy P. Cahill, the state was unable to borrow money last week on a short term loan. He also states that the state can afford to pay its bills and debts for the next few weeks, but not beyond that without a short-term loan from the government. Cahill has asked the federal government for a loan similar to the recent one passed by Congress and the Senate. ""That's all we would ask them to do: Treat us like the investment banks,"" said Cahill to the Associated Press. Officials in California say they need an emergency loan, or they will run out of money by the end of October. California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger said the state is ""not out of the woods"" and needs a short term loan from the government. ""California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing,"" said Schwarzenegger in a letter to the Treasury Department, which is taking the letter under consideration. On Friday, the U.S. House of Representative voted to pass a revised bailout bill which included raising the FDIC insurance cap to $250,000, a move designed to please progressives. However, the $110 billion in tax breaks, earmarks and what has been called pork barrel spending is not offset by any increases in revenues and has added opposition to the bill from some Representatives in the House. Earmarks added into the bailout bill included $192 million in tax rebates for the Virgin Islands rum industry, $148 million in tax cuts for the wool industry, $100 million tax cuts to the auto racing industry, and $48 million in Hollywood tax incentives, among others."

Microsoft hopes to catch the attention of users through banner advertisements on the company's websites. It will also launch promotional material which later will be handed out through Microsoft's partners. The company chose comics in an effort to reach a wider audience. The comics are drawn in black and white and they look similar to the ones presented in newspapers. The company has spent millions of dollars in its campaign against unauthorized copies of Windows, but cannot say whether the campaign has been successful."
business,"Software giant Microsoft has been attempting to purchase Internet giant Yahoo! in hopes of leveraging the internet presence of Yahoo! in Microsoft's battle with Google. The original offer for Yahoo! was $44 billion; however since this offer Microsoft has seen a revenue drop this last quarter which could greatly affect the software giant's ability to up the price again in hopes Yahoo! would accept. Revenues at Microsoft were down a total of 6%. This includes a 24% drop in revenue from the Windows Operating System alone. Stock prices of both Microsoft and Yahoo! have decreased during the merger discussions. Microsoft's next move is unknown but there has been talk of potentially going directly to the Yahoo! shareholders with a buyout plan. It is too early to tell how this will end, but Microsoft has made it known that it will try all available routes; up to and including a hostile takeover. Recent comments from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and CFO Chris Liddell have mentioned that not acquiring Yahoo! is also an option. Whatever Microsoft's plan is, the longer this takes, the more competitor Google will likely use this to their advantage is obtaining both clients and employees, says Juan Carlos Perez of IDG."
business,"IcelandA commissioner in Brussels has suggested that Iceland could be fast tracked to join the European Union (EU) by 2011. S. Solberg J The European Commissioner for enlargement, Olli Rehn, said that if the country, stricken by the world financial meltdown, applied for membership to the 52-year-old international economic and social organization this year, it would be welcomed with open arms. The EU is expecting an application if the Social Democratic Alliance wins May's general election in the country. The next entrant to the union is to be Croatia. It has been rapidly making changes to its government and economy in order to join in 2011. The EU will then have 28 members. Iceland could join at the same time, making 29. Iceland could join quickly because it is already a member of the European Economic Area and therefore already complies with many EU directives. The main contention would be Iceland's rich fishing waters, which are contested by several nearby fishing countries. Iceland and the United Kingdom fought short naval wars in the 1950s and 1970s over the issue of fishing rights in the area. There is also an issue with Ireland's failure to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, which was designed to streamline the union as more countries join. Without the unanimous ratification, further expansion is difficult. The EU has its roots in the six member European Coal and Steel Community, founded by France and then-West Germany in 1951. In 1957, the members of the Community formed the European Economic Community (EEC), a common market and customs union. The coal and steel organization was merged into the EEC in 1967. In 1993, the EEC became the European Union. The EU adopted a central banking system and single currency, the Euro, between 1999 and 2002. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Turkey are all on the waiting list for entry to the EU."
business,"Economy and business Trading on Russia's major stock markets has been suspended for a second consecutive day due to the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets around the world. The suspension took place due to an order of the Russian government's Federal Service for the Financial Markets, which demanded the suspension. ""It took too long for the money to get into the system,"" said Uralsib analyst Chris Weafer commenting on this decision. ""They were afraid of panic selling so they stopped the market."" Before the suspension, the RTS exchange fell by 6.39 percent in just two hours, while the MICEX index started the day with an increase, before falling again. This day was the worst day in Russia's market since the country's 1998 financial crisis Several financial markets have continued to lose value. The primary British index, the FTSE 100, dropped in value by 2.36%, which is 118.40 points, to below the 5000 mark at 4907.20. The Dow Jones, was down 2.62% at 16:08 UTC, a slight increase from earlier today. The Dow Jones currently has a value of 10769.00 points. The NASDAQ index has fallen by -3.16% to 2138.14, while the Dax was 1.75% lower than the start of the day at 16:08 UTC.

The cash injection will take place through VTB, Sberbank and Gazprom Bank, which are all state run banks."
business,"Economy and business Cornell University Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, remained in jail last night after being charged with sexually attacking a chambermaid at a New York City hotel. Strauss-Kahn has agreed to undergo forensic screening before he appears in court, and has vowed to ""vigorously"" defend himself against the charges, which are likely to create a leadership void at the IMF, disrupt emergency talks over the European debt crisis, and spell the end of his political career. Strauss-Khan was the favourite candidate for the French presidency, and was expected to announce he would stand against Nicolas Sarkozy this month. But the allegations are expected to destroy the hopes of his supporters, increase infighting among the French left, and leave his political career in tatters. His arrest comes at a critical moment for the IMF, and will likely plunge efforts to stabilise the financial states of struggling eurozone countries into chaos. He was meant to discuss the bailouts of Greece and Portugal with European Union financial officials at a meeting in Brussels this week. Eswar Shanker Prasad, a professor of international economics at Cornell University, said: ""This sordid episode &amp;ndash; no matter how it ultimately plays out &amp;ndash; will spell the end of Strauss-Kahn as an effective leader of the IMF even if he retains his position, which is highly unlikely."" The IMF, however, insisted it remained ""fully functioning and operational."" Strauss-Kahn was to appear in court in Manhattan yesterday charged with three crimes, including attempted rape, but the hearing has been delayed so he can undergo forensic tests. He was taken into custody by officials while on an Air France passenger plane which was about to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Paris; when detectives approached him in the first class cabin in the aircraft he reportedly asked: ""What is this about?"" Strauss-Kahn reportedly fled the hotel ""in a hurry"" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. ""If our officers had been ten minutes later he would have been in the air and on their sic way to France,"" a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said. The chambermaid reported that she had been sexually assaulted by a man staying in a ""luxury suite"" at the Sofitel hotel near Times Square. ""The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted,"" the police spokesperson said. Strauss-Kahn came out of the shower naked while the chambermaid was working in the room, tried to pull the woman onto the bed and locked the door, The New York Times reported, quoting police sources. She allegedly fought him off, but he sexually assaulted her again after dragging her to the bathroom, before he locked her in the room; she was reportedly hospitalized afterwards with trauma. In 2008, a year after becoming the leader of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn was reprimanded by the organization's board after being involved in an extramarital affair with another senior executive at the bank. More recently, he was pictured driving a luxury car in Paris, causing a media furore over whether his lifestyle fitted with the socialist attitude he claims to represent. But his wife, former television star Anne Sinclair, has dismissed the accusations. She said: ""I do not believe for one second the accusations brought against my husband. I have no doubt his innocence will be established."""
business,"Brazil Search and rescue operations for a light aircraft that disappeared seven days ago in Brazil have ceased having failed to locate the plane. In addition to two local pilots the Cessna 310 was carrying four businessmen who were citizens of the United Kingdom. Rescue teams utilising two air force helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft, as well as several naval vessels, scoured an area of 3,475 square miles off the North-East of the country for the missing plane, which was chartered from Aero Star. Although the plane and its occupants remain missing, some floating personal possessions from those on board and several pieces of wreckage have been recovered. The pilot and co-pilot have been identified as Clovis de Figueiredo e Silva and Leandro Oliveira Veloso respectively, and the passengers as Alan Kempson, Sean Woodhall, Ricky Every and Nigel Hodges. The businessmen were flying in connection to a propsed luxury housing development at the Bahia town of Ilheus, whose airport the plane had been a few kilometres away from and intending to land. The four Britons, three of whom reside abroad, had initially attempted to hire a helicopter for the journey but were denied this due to weather conditions that were deemed to poor for rotorcraft operation. Their relatives have hired a boat with sonar equipment and intend to search deeper waters for the lost plane."
business,"Airlines have attacked new EU legislation which will force them to pay greater compensation to customers in the event of overbooking, cancellations and delays. Consumer groups have praised the new rules, which set the level of compensation between €250 and €600 depending on the circumstances and the length of the flight. ""This is some comeback for passengers who have been inconvenienced,"" James Fremantle, industry affairs adviser for the Air Transport Users Council, told Reuters. Before this legislation came into effect, passengers ""bumped"" from a flight could claim between €150 and €300. The new rules apply to all scheduled and chartered flights. Previously only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking&amp;mdash; they did not have to extend compensation to travellers affected by flight cancellations. Low cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the compensation paid will exceed the price of the ticket. The effort by the EU is to discourage airlines from deliberately overbooking flights, a practice which has become routine for most major airlines. Overbooking often leads to ""bumping"", where passengers who cannot be guaranteed a seat are moved to a later flight. In future when this happens airlines will have to offer compensation. Additionally, if flights are cancelled or delayed by more than two hours all passengers must be compensated. This will be the case except in ""extraordinary circumstances"", the definition of which may or may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes. ""It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" Ryanair deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley told BBC radio 4's Today programme. It has also been claimed that the advice may mislead customers by having them believe that they may be entitled to compensation if flights are delayed due to bad weather. Marja Quillinan-Meiland, European Commission spokeswoman has said that there are ""grey areas"" but added ""these are not as big as the airlines are making out."" Disputed cases would be heard by national enforcement bodies which would decide if there is a case to answer. European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) director of air transport Andy Clarke said ""we reckon it's going to cost European air passengers – not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by the passengers – 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers. That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted."" These extra costs may also lead to carriers cancelling routes to areas that have been identified as problem destinations. The European Low-Fares Association (ELFA) is mounting a legal challenge to the laws. ELFA and International Air Transport Association expect a ruling from the European Court of Justice in fall of 2005, until then airlines have said they will comply with the regulations."
business,"Adam is a robot developed by Welsh Aberystwyth University researchers which combines artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and automation to independently conduct and analyse biological laboratory research. ""What's new and exciting about Adam is it is the first time we've managed to show that a computer can not only think up new scientific ideas, but experimentally test them and decide whether they're true,"" said Ross King, a computer science professor and lead researcher at Aberystwyth University, ""Adam makes up its own mind what to do. It decides what experiments to do, what to test."" He says that for other lab experiments the hardware is already in place, the only step needed is to change the software. The artificial intelligence alone spans three computers which holds the databases and analytical software to enable Adam to think. For the yeast experiment, Adam was loaded with databases which hold known information relating to yeasts and organisms. Adam compared all fields in the database to find the areas of missing information from which he devised 20 hypotheses. Adam's AI is connected to robotic arms, sensors, incubators and cameras which enable Adam to start over 1,000 individual experiments every day and follow their progress over a week. A part of the process is that Adam's AI can cycle and analyze the results of the experiments as well doing routine repetitious lab work. Following Adam's testing, King's team manually tested three of Adam's hypotheses and found that the robot's conclusions were correct, and each was a breakthrough to the scientific community. Adam has spawned discussion amongst researchers. William Melek, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Ontario's University of Waterloo, has noted that to set up the AI needed for subsequent experiments involving new biological variables and criteria, the human expertise would be time consuming to customize it. The usefulness would be limited therefore to the allotment of human input needed to set up Adam. David Waltz of Columbia University and Bruce Buchanan of the University of Pittsburgh say that ""For the foreseeable future, the prospect of using automated systems as assistants holds vast promise as these assistants are becoming not only faster but much broader in their capabilities -- more knowledgeable, more creative, and more self-reflective,"" They note the potential of such lab assistants which may more efficiently process the research data. It was reported that Adam cost about $1million in production costs and this was weighed against the costs of hiring lab techs. King said, We made many mistakes and learned from Adam. Eve is a much cleaner design."" Eve is the second AI computer under development by Professor King's research team. Eve's artificial intelligence will be enhanced to analyze compounds needed for medicinal drugs which may treat killer diseases such as malaria."
business,"The Bombay Stock Exchange Senstitive Index (Sensex) crashed 826 points and the National Stock Exchange's index (Nifty) 246 in what was the largest ever intra-day drop in the their histories. At the end of day's trade, the Sensex closed at 11,391 and the Nifty at 3,388. The market breadth is also negative - 2081 shares have declined, with only 336 stocks advancing. Analysts speculated that the reason for this drop was that the U.S. CPI number, which was released yesterday, was above expectations. This, coupled with weaknesses observed in the London Metal Exchange, has led to losses in emerging markets like India, Mexico, and Brazil. Asian Regional Strategist at JPMorgan Chase, Adrian Mowat, believes that the Sensex will stabilise at around the 11,000 mark after correcting by around 5-6%. Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram dismissed the issue and described it as a routine fluctuation. The main losers in today's crash were the steel and cement segments."

Sanctioned picket lines have been formed outside Authority facilities in Garden Grove, Anaheim, and Santa Ana. About 200,000 regular passengers are affected. Major sticking points in the negotiation appear to be related to cost-of-living increases and pension funding allocations.

business,"disasters and accidents An EF4 tornado struck near St. Louis, Missouri Friday night, forcing the closure of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and damaging over 2,700 buildings in St. Louis County. The National Weather Service also confirmed that an EF1 tornado touched down in neighboring St. Charles County and an EF2 touched down in Pontoon Beach, Illinois. The city of Bridgeton, in North St. Louis County, was hit by the EF4 tornado. According to the National Weather Service, it was the most powerful tornado to touch down in the St. Louis region since 1967, with winds ranging from 166 and 200 miles (267 and 322 kilometres) per hour. Aftereffects of that tornado were also reported in Maryland Heights, Missouri. One official estimated that anywhere from 50 to 200 homes in the Maryland Heights and Bridgeton areas incurred damage, but early numbers released by St. Louis County indicate that over 2,000 buildings in those two cities had suffered ""noticeable damage,"" which does not include minor damage. Around 30,000 people in the region did not have power Saturday, out of a total of 47,000 affected residents. Authorities with search and rescue dogs went door-to-door Saturday, looking for possibly trapped residents. Aerial imagery was being used in damage assessment. Area residents unaffected by the tornado were assisting those that lost their homes, reported St. Louis television station KSDK. The Harmann Estates neighborhood of Bridgeton was heavily damaged during the storm, with many residences losing roofs and siding. Officials have already condemned some of the subdivision's homes. St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley reported 25 homes in Bridgeton and Berkeley, Missouri as being completely destroyed and an additional 35 as uninhabitable. Granite City, Illinois was struck by the EF2 tornado, while New Melle, Missouri was hit by the EF1. Fourteen New Melle homes sustained minor damage, while four were heavily damaged. The storm also caused the temporary shutdown of two major St. Louis highways. Portions of Interstate 70 and Interstate 270 were closed Friday night due to fallen power lines and storm debris. Both blocked sections have since reopened, but officials said it would take a few days to remove all the debris, which they pushed onto the roadsides. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, which is immediately west of Berkeley, suffered heavy damage Friday night from the same tornado, and was forced to halt all regular operations Saturday while crews worked to clear the affected terminals. Eight flights had been forced to land in Kansas City, Missouri Friday night due to the tornado. About 500 people were in Lambert Airport when the tornado hit. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesperson said other US airports were not affected by Lambert's shutdown. Lambert is not an airline hub and is significantly less busy than it was ten years ago. In a Saturday press conference, Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge, Lambert's director, said the airfield and Terminal 2 were ""fully functional,"" but the main terminal's Concourse C had been severely impacted by the storm. That terminal, which sustained the heaviest damage, serves Air Tran, American Airlines, Cape Air, and Frontier Airlines. The total cost of repairs at Lambert is expected to be in the millions of dollars, but Hamm-Niebruegge said the airport does not yet have a good estimate. 4=Witness at Lambert Airport One passenger of a waiting plane at Lambert told KSDK that heavy winds pushed the aircraft about 20 feet (6.1 metres) while it was still attached to the gate. Two other planes on the tarmac were unable to return to the airport, so passengers were bused back. Five planes—four operated by American and one by Southwest Airlines—suffered damage, and some will undergo major repairs. Some travelers inside the airport received medical attention for minor injuries caused by flying glass. A handful of people were transported to a local hospital for additional treatment, but all were later released. ""We get to the terminal and lights were out, glass everywhere, blood everywhere from people had been cut,"" recalled one witness. Another person at the airport reported, ""The ceiling was falling. The glass was hitting us in the face. Hail and rain were coming in. The wind was blowing debris all over the place. It was like being in a horror movie. Grown men were crying."" On Saturday, it was evident that Concourse C would not be open for some time, said Mayor of St. Louis Francis Slay. A large section of its roof was missing and around half of its windows had been blown out by the high winds. Debris and water from the storm were present inside the airport as crews worked to restore power and assess damage to the terminal. Missing windows had been boarded up, ruined carpet had been removed, and the control tower was functional by Saturday afternoon. The power was back on by 7:40 p.m. CDT (00:40 UTC) that evening. The airport resumed outgoing flight services Sunday, although several incoming flights landed at Lambert Saturday evening. Slay said the airport will be running at 70 percent capacity until mid-week, depending on the availability of airline crew members and planes. Airlines using Concourse C will have their operations temporarily relocated, he added. On Sunday, Southwest was operating at normal capacity, while AirTran moved to Concourse B and canceled four of its eleven scheduled flights. A spokesperson for American said the airline would have planes ready for normal Monday operations. American had previously canceled all St. Louis flights scheduled for Sunday. 4=St. Louis, Missouri mayor Francis Slay On Saturday afternoon, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon arrived at Lambert and visited areas devastated by the tornado. He originally planned to tour Maryland Heights, Bridgeton, and Berkeley, but Nixon was only able to tour Berkeley due to an approaching line of storms. While in St. Louis, the governor said 750 Missouri homes had been damaged by Friday's tornadoes and that federal assistance was forthcoming. Nixon reported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was involved in assessing storm damage, as well as that US President Barack Obama had already contacted him, promising relief funds. US Representative Lacy Clay, said Saturday that he would brief Obama on the situation. The state declared the affected areas of St. Louis County a disaster area. No one has reported serious injuries or deaths as a result of the storm, although some people were treated for minor injuries. ""It was horrific and for that much damage to been done, to have no loss of life, is truly a blessing,"" Slay said."
business,"New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced last Wednesday that it has agreed definitively to merge with Chicago-based Archipelago Exchange (ArcaEx) and form a new publicly traded, for-profit company known as NYSE Group. This announcement was followed two days later by NASDAQ®, which independently announced a definitive agreement to purchase Instinet Group. Archipelago and Instinet are innovative e-trading (electronic trading) companies, and formerly were the two largest American rivals to NYSE and NASDAQ, in recent years taking increasingly large portions of their market share. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies still have to review and approve the transactions, particularly with respect to US securities law and antitrust law, in order to ensure that the marketplace remains lawful and competitive. Other pending issues for NASDAQ include obtaining the approval of Instinet shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions. NYSE must obtain the approval of its members and Archipelago shareholders. These changes, a reaction to increased e-trading competition and a changed regulatory environment, will result in NASDAQ and NYSE trading each other's shares and attempting to grab market share, which many hope will drive down transaction costs and ultimately benefit consumers. However, at least one commentator, Dan Ackman writing in Forbes, has noted that the trading commission at the NYSE currently averages less than a nickel (US$0.05) per share, and was less enthusiastic about potential efficiency gains from electronic trading at the exchange. The transactions are also intended to make the two leading American stock exchanges more globally competitive with such exchanges as the London Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Australian Stock Exchange located in Sydney. The NYSE-Archipelago merger would result in some of the most sweeping changes in the 212-year history of the NYSE. The NYSE, which has always been a not-for-profit company, would for the first time incorporate and itself be a publicly-traded company, in what is potentially a large stock offering. However, the regulatory functions of the NYSE would continue to be conducted independently by a private not-for-profit organization. NYSE is merging with Archipelago in a ""stock for membership"" deal, in which NYSE members are to receive cash and 70% of newly issued stock, and Archipelago's shareholders would receive 30% of the new stock, forming a new holding company known as the NYSE Group. The merger is expected to be completed by either the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006. ""This strategic move is courageous, almost unbelievable, but this is going to make the New York Stock Exchange in my opinion a potentially giant publicly traded company. The main reason is they've got brand, they've got companies, they've got liquidity and with Archipelago they have electronic global access,"" said Harold Bradley of American Century Investments to Investor's Business Daily. NYSE has traditionally used the ""open cry auction"" system where buyers and sellers gather in a boisterous trading floor to shout ""buy"" and ""sell"" orders. It has been slow to adapt to new technology, still manually punching in 90% of its orders. However, Last November NYSE introduced a new, faster Java-based trading system for its floor exchange that is currently in the process of phased roll-out. NYSE TradeWorksSM, a management system for stock orders, was developed in a first-of-kind partnership with external company IBM, using J2EE open systems, custom-built Linux-based workstations and HP-UX servers running IBM's WebSphere middleware, and a DB2 database on the back end running on an IBM zSeries mainframe. NYSE, which does most of its IT development internally, announced that they do not plan to combine their IT department with Archipelago's. The future of the traditional floor trading system remains uncertain. Some commentators believe it provides a necessary antidote to the occasionally chaotic instability of electronic trading, while others believe that future trends toward electronic trading would provide advantages of speed and fluidity of trade, and make the old-fashioned system of floor trading redundant and obsolete. Roger Burkhardt, Chief Technology Officer of NYSE, told Computerworld last December that the merger will attempt a ""hybrid"" trading model where both human and computer trading are coordinated side-by-side, which in its scope is a difficult and unprecedented task. Current owners of seats in the exchange have expressed concerns over how the new merger will affect them. The seats, which confer the right to trade on the floor and are typically leased to traders under the current system, will likely be bought back by the NYSE Group from the individual owners. The exact system of how traders will lease access to the trading floor from the new company has yet to be worked out. Also of concern to owners is the reported plans for a ""stock lockup"" (preventing selling of portions of stock in the new NYSE Group by the new stock recipients) for the next 3 to 5 years. However, their inability to immediately profit from sale of their newly issued stock would be compensated by the price they receive for their seat, or perhaps by a separate stock issuance. The NYSE has been subject to complaints in recent years, concerning: * former chairman Richard Grasso and his nearly US$140 million compensation package, thought to be excessive. * advantages held by floor traders which are perceived to be unfair by the general public. * conversely, a lack of attention to the needs of floor traders. * various regulatory actions including an indictment against 15 current and former traders earlier this month on charges of improper trading. However, most of the participants in the merger expressed confidence in taking advantage of historic opportunities. “This combination will be good for investors and for America. It will create a strong, dynamic and innovative enterprise capable of meeting the demands of investors and issuers throughout the world in the decades ahead,” said John A. Thain, CEO of the NYSE. “As we look to the future and to the challenge of competing globally in a high-speed electronically connected world, it is clear that we must do more. This transaction will mean we will be more diversified and transparent, and better able to compete, grow and serve our customers."" NASDAQ, formerly an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, was founded in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market, and by some measures is now the world's largest exchange. Its purchase of Instinet Group, although it followed the NYSE merger announcement by only two days, was actually pursued independently for as long as six months and is set to continue regardless of the NYSE outcome. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of this year. NASDAQ's planned acquisition, Instinet Group, will be split along the lines of its separate divisions for sale in a cash transaction (figures are approximate): * Instinet, an institutional broker with about 1,500 customers and worldwide access to more than 30 securities markets, will be sold to private equity group Silver Lake Partners for US$207.5 million. The transaction will mostly be financed in convertible notes from NASDAQ issued to Silver Lake as well as Hellman &amp; Friedman, who is the largest shareholder in NASDAQ. * Lynch, Jones, and Ryan (LJR), provider of commission rebate services and subsidiary of Instinet which they acquired in 2000, would be sold to the Bank of New York for US$174 million. * INET, the electronic marketplace and former competitor to NASDAQ with more than 800 broker-dealer customers involving access to about 25% of NASDAQ equities trading, would be sold to NASDAQ for US$934.5 million, in a transaction to be partly financed by the issuance of US$750 million in six-year corporate bonds; NASDAQ expects the deal to become profitable to its shareholders within a year. Instinet stockholders would receive about US$1.88 billion in cash total, including the above amounts as well as US$562 million from INET's available cash. Of this amount, about US$1 billion would go to Reuters, a shareholder of 62% of the company's stock, which is getting rid of Instinet to focus on its core areas of providing news and financial data. NASDAQ president and CEO Bob Greifeld, said, “This transaction will allow NASDAQ to compete more effectively with other U.S. and international market centers by making our technological platform more competitive, which will result in greater cost efficiencies and improved quality of execution in our market &amp;mdash; qualities that today’s individual and institutional investors demand. NASDAQ will continue to innovate and will also have the ability to tap new opportunities in other asset classes.” He continued, “Regulation NMS has defined the new competitive landscape by calling for all market centers to be mutually accessible. With this move we maintain our status as the low cost provider and at the same time provide increased order interaction for both NASDAQ and exchange listed securities. We also believe this further enhances our ability to attract new listings. We want to thank all of our partners for their combined efforts on this transaction."""
business,"Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel gave yesterday's opening address to the 42nd meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is facing a distinctly different geo-political landscape from twelve months ago. Outside the WEF security cordon, in the sub-zero temperatures of Davos' train station car park, the local incarnation of the Occupy movement are setting up 'Camp Igloo'; but, with little hope of the archetypes of the 1%, 'Davos Man', arriving by public transport and seeing their sub-zero protest. David Roth, heading the Swiss centre-left's youth wing &amp;mdash; and an organiser of 'Camp Igloo', echoes much of the sentiment from 'Occupy' protests around the world; ""at meetings the rest of society is excluded from, this powerful '1 percent' negotiates and decides about the fate of the other 99 percent of this world, ... economic and financial concentration of power in a small, privileged minority leads to a dictatorship over the rest of us. The motto 'one person, one vote' is no longer valid, but 'one dollar, one vote'."" Roth's characterisation of 'Davos Man', a term coined by the Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard University, is more emotive than that of the late professor who saw 'Davos man' as ""having... little need for national loyalty, viewing national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and seeing national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations"". As Reuters highlights, many attendees will opt to make their way from Zurich to Davos by private jet, or helicopter, and the WEF itself provides handouts indicating the cost of such is 5,100 Swiss francs (approx. 5,500 USD, 3,500 GBP, 4,200 EUR). In contrast: travelling by rail, even when opting for first class &amp;mdash; without an advance booking, is 145 Swiss francs (approx. 155 USD, 100 GBP). Shifting fortunes see several past attendees missing this year's exclusive get-together in the alpine resort; for a second year running &amp;mdash; and now caught up in the UK phone hacking scandal being scrutinised by Lord Leveson's inquiry &amp;mdash; media mogul Rupert Murdoch will not be attending. Nor will the former head of financial services company UBS Oswald Gruebel, who resigned in the wake of US$2.3 billion losses incurred through unauthorised trading; likewise, Philipp Hildebrand, the ex-head of the Swiss National Bank, is absent following scandal associated with his wife's currency trading activities; and, although the sexual assault charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn were dropped, having stepped down as managing director of the International Monetary Fund Strauss-Kahn will also be absent. As the #OccupyWEF protesters were building igloos last weekend, an anti-WEF protest in the Swiss capital Berne was broken up by police, who stated their intent to prosecute participants in the illegal protest. Allegations of calls for violent protest action led to a high number of officers being involved. In the aftermath, charges of breach of the peace are to be brought against 153 people, with some targeted for more serious offences. At least one group involved in the protest described the police response as ""disproportionate"". At 'Camp Igloo' Roth says he is seeking discussions with the WEF's expected 2,000 attendees; but his voice, and that of others in the worldwide 'Occupy' movement, is unlikely to be given a platform in the opening debate, ""Is 20th-century capitalism failing 21st-century society?"" He, and others taking part in this Swiss incarnation of the 'Occupy' movement, are still considering an invite to a side-session issued by the World Economic Forum's founder, Klaus Schwab; commenting on the invite Roth told the Associated Press they would prefer a debate at a more neutral venue. As has been the case for several years now, the annual Forum meeting in Davos was preceded with the release of a special report by the World Economic Forum into risks seen as likely to have an impact the in the coming decade. The 2012 Global Risks Report is a hefty document; the 64-page report is backed with a variety of visualisation tools designed to allow the interrelations between risks to be viewed, how risks interact modelled, and their potential impacts considered &amp;mdash; as assessed by the WEF's panel of nearly 500 experts. As one would expect, economic risks top both the 2012 impact and likelihood charts. Climate change is pushed somewhat further down the list of concerns likely to drive discussions in Davos. ""Major systemic financial failure"" &amp;mdash; the collapse of a globally important financial institution, or world currency, is selected as the risk which carries the most potential impact. However, ""Chronic fiscal imbalances"" &amp;mdash; failing to address excessive government debt, and ""Severe income disparity"" &amp;mdash; a widening of the the gulf between rich and poor, top the list of most likely risks. At the other end of the tables, disagreeing respectively with the weight last year's Wikinews report gave to orbital debris, and the Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) fight with the Internet over copyright legislation, the 2012 Global Risks Report places ""Proliferation of Orbital Debris"" and ""Failure of intellectual property regime"" bottom of the league in terms of potential impact. In 2011, with the current global economic crisis well under-way, ""Fiscal crises"" topped the WEF risks with the largest potential impact in the next ten years. However, perceived as most likely a year ago, ""Storms and cyclones"", ""Flooding"", and ""Biodiversity loss"" &amp;mdash; all climate-change related points &amp;mdash; were placed ahead of ""Economic disparity"" and ""Fiscal crises"". More mundane risks overtake the spectre of terrorism when contrasting this year's report with the 2011 one; volatility in the prices of commodities, consumer goods, and energy, and the security of water supplies are all now ranked as more likely risks than terrorism &amp;mdash; though the 2011 report did rank some of these concerns as having a higher potential impact. A significant shift in perception sees the 2012 report highlight food shortages almost as likely a risk the world will face over the next decade; and, one with a far more significant impact. Attending the World Economic Forum at Davos is more than just an opportunity to discuss the current state of the global economy, and review the risks which face countries around the world. With such a high number of political and business leaders in attendance, it is an ideal opportunity to pursue new trade deals. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is, in addition to being a keynote speaker, expected to pursue improved relations with European and Asian trade partners at private meetings on the Forum sidelines. The Toronto Star reports Harper is likely to push forward an under-negotiation Canadian-European free-trade agreement, and hold closed-door discussions prior to next month's planned trip to China. Similarly, Canadian trade minister Ed Fast is expected to meet South Korean counterparts to discuss an equivalent deal to the preferential ones between the Asian nation and the US and Europe. Fast's deal does, however, face opposition at home; the Canadian Auto Workers union asserts that such a deal would put 33,0000 jobs at-risk. Do you believe discussions in Davos can make a difference globally? British Prime Minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne are expected to discuss a possible increase of UK funding to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); however, with the UK responsible for 4.5% of the US$400 billion in the IMF's lending fund, backbench MPs have warned that committing any additional funds could provoke a Conservative revolt in parliament. Tuesday's IMF cut of predicted global growth from 4% to 3.3%, warnings of a likely Eurozone recession in 2012, and ongoing problems with Greek financial restructuring, are likely discussion topics at Davos &amp;mdash; as well as amongst UK backbench MPs who see adding to the IMF war-chest as bailing out failed European economies. South Africa, less centre-stage during the 2011 Forum, will be looking to improve relationships and take advantage of their higher profile. President Jacob Zuma and several cabinet members are attending sessions and discussions; whilst former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is to moderate a session, ""Africa &amp;mdash; From Transition to Transformation"", with Nigeria, Guinea, and South Sudan's presidents on the panel. Wal-mart's CEO Doug McMillon is to lead a dinner session, ""Shared Opportunities for Africa's Future"" &amp;mdash; highlighting larger multinationals looking towards the continent for new opportunities. Davos may also serve as a place to progress disputes out of the public eye; a high-profile dispute between Chile's state-owned copper mining business, Codelco, and Anglo American plc over the 5.39 billion USD sale of a near-quarter stake in their Chilean operations to Japan's Mitsubishi, prompted the Financial Times to speculate that, as the respective company chiefs &amp;mdash; Diego Hernández and Cynthia Carroll &amp;mdash; are expected to attend, they could privately discuss the spat during the Forum. __NOTOC__"
business,"The environmental activist group Greenpeace has attempted to disrupt Japan's Southern Ocean ""scientific"" whaling fleet. After searching for the whaling fleet for nearly a month, the Greenpeace ships, MY Esperanza and MY Arctic Sunrise, are floating alongside the Japanese mothership in Australia's Antarctic territorial waters, directly south of Tasmania. The Japanese whaling fleet has an expected catch of over 900 minke whales – more than double its previous catch. The fleet - owned by Kyodo Senpaku and part-owned by Nissui, Japan's second-largest marine products firm - is also targeting endangered fin whales for what they claim is a scientific program. Fin whales are the second largest creatures on earth. Greenpeace say they have asked the whalers to stop whaling immediately and return to Japan, but have received no response from the vessels. In inflatables carrying banners which read ""defend the whales"" and ""stop the whaling,"" crew from the two ships declared their intention to stop the hunt. Leader of the Greenpeace expedition, Shane Rattenbury said their eight small boats have begun to ""interfere"" with the whaling process. ""We positioned our two ships to the stern of the Japanese mother ship in order to prevent the whale being transferred on to the ship and we were successful in stopping that process for about 45-minutes,"" said Mr Rattenbury, describing a capture boat ramming the Greenpeace ship in an attempt to push it clear. He said the Japanese boat fought back with water cannons and one of several Greenpeace inflatables capsized in the wash. All crew were retrieved without injury. ""We're going to do everything we can over the coming weeks to interfere with the whaling process, and stop the whales being killed,"" he said, ""our small boats will be putting themselves between the harpoon and the whale. In a radio call to the whaling vessels, from the bridge of the Arctic Sunrise, Yuko Hirono, of Greenpeace Japan called upon the whalers to stop killing whales ""and leave the internationally recognised Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary."" Japan's scientific whaling has been the subject of repeated criticism by the International Whaling Commission. The Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research, claim the amount of scientific data gathered by Japan's research program (JARPAII) is extensive and that Japan's whale research programs are conducted in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The Institute of Cetacean Research say their research does not involve illegal whaling. Greenpeace say over the next 2 years, 40 more fin whales will be added to the annual kill, along with 50 humpback whales. Southern Ocean whaling season (2005-2006) ""This whale hunt is unnecessary, unjustified, and unwanted,"" said Rattenbury. ""Once the whales have been measured and weighed by the 'scientists' the butchers get to work and the whales are cut up and boxed for market. This is all about money and not science."" The area in which the Japanese fleet is hunting has been designated as the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary, in an effort to allow whale populations to recover after stocks were depleted during the commercial whaling of the last century. Seventy crew and campaigners from 19 countries are on board the two Greenpeace vessels, including the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Ghana, Russia, Norway, Denmark, USA, France, Italy, Japan, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Austria and Argentina. Japan's whaling program is expected to kill nearly one thousand whales this season."
business,"China property giant Evergrande Group wired USD83.5 million in interest owed in an offshore bond from September 23 on Thursday, temporarily averting default, according to a Reuters source and Chinese newspaper Securities Times. The wire to a Citibank fiduciary account following a 30-day grace period came after assurances by various members of the Chinese government, Reuters reported. At a Beijing forum Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He described the risks as controllable, and chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission Yi Huiman said that while authorities needed to curb excessive debt more broadly by ""improving the effectiveness of the constraint mechanism on debt financing"", the matter would be dealt with properly. Once China's top real estate developer, Evergrande had accumulated approximately USD305 billion in liabilities, two per cent of the Chinese gross national product, after ""dwindling resources"" cut its value by 80%, according to Reuters. September data revealed Chinese home sales by value fell by nearly 17% year-on-year, according to The Guardian, and fears over its default led to a slowdown in China's third quarter GDP growth to a year low of 4.9%. Two sale negotiations with rival developers Hopson Development and Yuexiu, valued at USD2.6 billion and USD1.7 billion, respectively, were suspended, reportedly due to a lack of consent by the government of Guangdong province currently overseeing Evergrande's restructuring. News of Evergrande's remittance caused its shares to rise by as much as 7.8% this morning after a two-week pause in trading for the anticipated sale of 50.1% in Evergrande Property Services Group, and offering some reprieve for bondholders, according to Reuters. Portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management James Wong, interviewed by The Guardian, called the news ""a positive surprise"", adding ""if Evergrande pays this time, I don't see why it won't pay the next time."" Jun Rong Yeap for IG Asia private limited company, Singapore, interviewed by Bloomberg, said the report ""overturned"" the narrative ""that Evergrande will face difficulty in securing cash ahead"". Further missed payments are due October 29 and November 11 after similar 30-day grace periods; including yesterday's USD83.5 million, nearly USD280 million is owed to bondholders. Stocks have been down for many major Chinese developers: Reuters Wednesday reported year-to-date stock prices fell 87.8% for Sinic Holdings, currently in Fitch Ratings' 'restricted default' after failing to make an October 18 bond payment valued, according to The Guardian, at USD246 million; 80.2% for Evergrande itself; 78.3% for E-House, 58.5% for Fantasia Holdings and 54.6% for Kaisa Group, which defaulted in 2015 and had bonds reach record lows. Estimates of the Chinese real estate market's size range from 16 to 25% of the Chinese gross domestic product, according to The Guardian. Chinese President Xi Jinping's aim to transform the country's economy from one of debt-fuelled ""inflated"" growth to one of improved ""quality and returns"" included imposing regulations on developers that limited their capacity to borrow. A Guardian comment piece from economist George Magnus published on October 15 made reference to China's ""ghost cities"" and ""rampant credit creation"" that has given rise to high vacancy rates and the ""financialisaton of housing""."

business,"United Kingdom The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest civil services trade union in the United Kingdom, yesterday reversed its decision to hold a strike for its UK Home Office worker members scheduled for today, the day before the Olympic Games are due to start in London. The strike, which was called last week as a result of job reductions being made, would have affected the UK Border Agency (UKBA), the Identity and Passport Service, and the Criminal Records Bureau, at London Heathrow Airport amongst other UK airports. PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka cited the ""significant development"" of the creation of 1100 new job positions, 800 in the UKBA and 300 in the Passport Service, as the reason for the union's decision change. ""We believe that significant progress means that there is no case for the union to proceed with industrial action tomorrow,"" Serwotka said yesterday morning. The PCS also reported position recruitment advertisements appearing on the Internet for London Heathrow, London Luton and Gatwick Airport. However, the UK government's Home Office denied that they had created such positions. ""We have made no concessions to the PCS and are not creating any new jobs in response to their threat of strike action"", a spokesperson for the Home Office stated. Saying the recruitment effort, initiated two months ago, was amongst scheduled modifications to the UK Border Force, the spokesperson clarified: ""Unfortunately, due to an administrative error, a figure of 400 posts was repeated in both adverts by mistake. This will now be corrected"". Serwotka's announcement was made one hour before lawyers representing the UK government had been due at the High Court to attempt to gain an injunction preventing the strike. According to the PCS, the government's plan was based on accusations that twelve staff members in Brussels and Paris became involved in the dispute despite the fact they would be unaffected. What do you think about the decision of the PCS? The PCS' decision was welcomed by airport operating company BAA. ""So far passengers arriving for the Olympics have had a smooth journey through Heathrow and it is great news that those arriving tomorrow can also expect a warm welcome to London and the Games"", a spokeswoman for BAA said yesterday. UK Home Secretary Theresa May had considered the PCS' plans ""opportunist and wholly unjustified"". Serwotka said he had ""absolutely no regrets"" about his previous decision to call the strike. The PCS has also postponed plans to launch a work-to-rule initiative during the 2012 Summer Olympics."
business,"Economy and businessUS bank Goldman Sachs has been accused of fraud by the American regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 4=A statement from the SEC, accusing Goldman Sachs of fraud According to the SEC, Goldman Sachs failed to inform investors of a conflict of interest in the banks' marketing of sub-prime mortgage investments, which were being sold at a time of uncertainty in the US housing market. The SEC says that a Goldman subsidiary, Paulson &amp; Co, had been involved in the selection of securities included in the mortgage investments. It had not been disclosed to investors that Paulson had bet that the value of the investments would fall, benefiting Paulson but not those who bought the investments. The securities, which were combined into a package called Abacus that was sold to investors, lost over $1 billion during the collapse of the US housing industry. According to the SEC, Goldman, Paulson, and the creator of Abacus, a vice-president of Goldman Sachs named Fabrice Tourre, all knew that the housing market was going to collapse, but continued to sell Abacus despite the risks. Tourre had been in command of selecting the investments within Abacus, and then was the person responsible for selling it to investors. He had told those who invested in Abacus that its components had been selected by an independent party, ACA Management. In all, 99% of the investments within Abacus were downgraded, and investors lost upwards of a billion US dollars. The SEC alleged that ""Goldman Sachs arranged a transaction at Paulson's request in which Paulson heavily influenced the selection of the portfolio to suit its economic interests."" In a short response from Goldman, the bank said that ""The SEC's charges are completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation."""

As a result, it is impossible for most Sprint and Cogent customers to communicate directly between each other across the Internet. The actual reasons for the dispute are unknown, though Cogent has had similar disputes in the past with Level3, Telia, Limelight, France Telecom, and AOL. The two ISPs are currently in litigation over peering, the free exchange of traffic between the ISPs for little or no cost. In shutting down the peering, according to Cogent, Sprint is in violation of a contractual obligation to exchange Internet traffic. However, according to Sprint, Cogent has failed to meet its criteria for the peering agreement, and should be required to pay for the traffic, which Cogent refused to do. The de-peering has resulted in some customers of both companies experiencing dropped connections.

business,"Thai low-cost air carrier One-Two-Go Airlines has announced that it will be grounding all 16 of its aircraft immediately until September 15. The news comes as legal action against the airline and associated companies begins over the September crash of Flight 269, which killed 90 people, mostly foreigners. Udom Tantiprasongchai, founder of the airline, has said conditions were hard for airlines with fuel prices having doubled within a year. He says 70% of operating costs are taken up with fuel, and the airline has already raised fuel surcharges again by 100 baht to 850 baht per leg. ""In this kind of environment, anyone can go (bankrupt) anytime,"" said Urdom, who declined to comment on the impact the present financial situation has had on his airline, saying only that they ""are financially sustainable."" He also said that the airline could return to service with ease if prices dropped, noting that, ""if the situation improved with fuel prices being lowered and the profitability outlook was better, we could be airborne again."" The airline began operations in 2003; it is a subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines. Orient Thai, which will continue to operate as normal, recently opened Thailand's first freight-only airline, Orient Thai Cargo, with a pair of Boeing 747-200Fs bought from Japan Airlines. Urdon said that a major part of the problem is that eight of the company's aircraft are MD-11s, which consume large volumes of fuel. He also said that a collapse of a damage limitation scheme with rivals Nok Airlines and Thai AirAsia had affected his decision. Both rival carriers were also struggling financially. One-Two-Go has already cut many routes. The news comes as the first families of victims of Flight OG269 launch legal action against the airline, as well as parent airline Orient Thai and lessor Grandmax Group. Already confirmed to be involved in the action are Richard and Margaret Collins as well as Steve and Jean Jones, parents of Alex Collins, 22, and Bethan Jones, also 22, an unmarried Welsh couple who, a few days into a round-the-world trip, were among the 123 passengers on board. Alex was reported missing but quickly confirmed to have died, while Bethan died ten days after the accident with her family at her bedside, bringing the final death toll to 90. ""We believe the air crash was completely avoidable and those responsible should be held to account. While we accept that nothing can bring Alex and Bethan and the other people who lost their lives back, we are keen to make sure we prevent this from happening again,"" said the families in a joint statement.

Compared to the first quarter of 2009, checked baggage fees soared 33% to $769 million. The airlines also reaped $554 million in reservation change fees, and made $534 million from other ancillary sources; such services (including checked baggage fees, reservation change fees, etc.) made up 21.7% of Spirit Airlines' income, the highest in the industry. The US airline industry is made up of 21 carriers, according to the U.S Department of Transportation. The five ""network"" or legacy carriers&amp;mdash;including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, American Airlines and US Airways&amp;mdash;continue to struggle and posted a $163 million loss as a group. Delta Air Lines had the highest profit, at $107 million, while American Airlines was at the other side of the carriers, with a $322 million loss. Low-cost carriers fared better, posting a $115 million profit as a group, with Southwest Airlines having the largest profit, at $54 million, while Allegiant Air's profit margins were the highest of the budget carriers at 20%. Regional airlines made a $60 million profit. The world's airlines expect a US$2.5 billion profit as a whole, despite an earlier forcast of a loss.

Ryanair has currently hedged oil prices at US$68 per barrel, but this is set to expire, leaving the no-frills airline paying full market prices. ""Our hedging finishes next week and we go from about $70 to about $100. Next year's fuel bill is going up by €400m.

The airline, which is Ireland's second-largest, also announced today that its operating loss for last year went up by four times, to 81 million euros. The labour union IMPACT, which represents cabin crew for Aer Lingus, is to meet with the airline's management tomorrow regarding the company's move. The union also remarked that time available to ""broker a solution is extremely limited."" Aer Lingus revenue dropped to 1.21 billion euros after an eleven percent drop last year, according to the airline, even though passenger numbers increased to 10.4 million. According to the Bloomberg news service, Aer Lingus' net cash reserves went down to 335 million euros."
business,"Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines announced plans to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by the end of 2007, approximately 17% of its employees. CEO Gerald Grinstein will take a 25% pay cut. Executives have their pay cut by 15%. Other employees will have their pay reduced by 7 to 10%. Employees that make less than $25,000 a year will not be affected by these pay cuts. Delta has already cancelled leases on 40 aircraft and they plan to reduce its fleet by at least 80 more. They plan to reduce domestic capacity by 15 to 20 percent and increase international capacity by 25 percent. Delta is the third-largest airline in the US. They have lost 10 billion dollars since 2001 and are 14 billion dollars in debt. Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Wednesday, joining United Airlines and US Airways. Four of the seven largest US carriers are operating under bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 protection gives companies time to rearrange its finances while continuing to operate. Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein said they intended ""to move from being an unprofitable airline today to a profitable airline in just over two years"". ""This means we will become a smaller, more cost-efficient airline, with a strengthened network and a stronger balance sheet."" These cuts should help save Delta up to $3 billion dollars."
business,"United Airlines and Continental Airlines shareholders yesterday approved a US$3.2 billion merger that would create the world's largest airline. 98% of shareholders approved of the deal. In the deal, United stockholders will hold 55% of the company, while Continental stockholders will get 1.05 new shares for each Continental share and will hold the remaining 45% of the company. The deal was earlier approved by United States antitrust regulators. The new company, which keeps United's name but Continental's globe logo, has little overlap in its route network, and will be headed by Continental CEO Jeff Smisek. The new company surpasses rival Delta Air Lines, which merged only a year ago, to become the world's largest. The airlines expect to complete the merger by October 1 of this year, and customers can expect to see major changes in spring 2011, when the new United will rebrand their kiosks, worker uniforms and airplanes. The new company is calling the day when they rebrand ""Customer Day One"". ""Our stockholders recognized the value of bringing together Continental and United to create a platform for increased profitability and sustainable, long-term growth,"" Smisek announced after the merger. Some analysts agree. ""No further obstacles to the merger are likely at this point,"" Jim Corridore, Standard &amp; Poor's equity analyst, said to investors. Corridore also said that ""we are positive on the planned merger, which we think creates an extremely strong global route network with opportunities for cost and revenue synergies."" Other people were less positive about the merger. Rick Seaney, CEO of FareCompare.com, said that ""losing a major competitor is likely to make prices rise — all things equal on the economy and fuel prices."" Also, a lawsuit in California accusing the merger of monopolizing the market and raising fares has been filed by lawyer Joseph Alioto, who claims that he represents consumers. United and Continental have defended themselves against accusations of monopolizing the airline industry by stating that they compete with low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines on three quarters of their US network. The airlines have also said that the low overlap and the low-cost competition will bring fares to heel."
business,"A U.S. nuclear-powered submarine collided with a Japanese oil-tanker in the Strait of Hormuz late last night. Only minor damage to the tanker and no serious injuries were reported. The USS Newport News submarine collided with the stern of the Japanese oil-tanker, causing minor damage to the tanker. No personnel on either vessel were seriously injured, US Navy and Japanese government officials said. The straits of Hormuz connect the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and is a major waterway for oil tankers. Immediately after the incident the tanker was able to continue to nearby port in the United Arab Emirates. The tanker is owned by Japanese shipping company Kawasaki Kisen Ltd. The Japanese government was informed of the incident soon after by the Navy and the U.S Embassy in Tokyo. They have requested that the U.S investigate the cause of the incident. The recent incident is a stark reminder of the February 2001 incident when a U.S. Submarine rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel in waters off Hawaii, killing nine people."
business,"The United States' third-largest airline operator, Delta Air Lines, will cut 1,000 jobs due to a planned service reduction at their Cincinnati hub. The carrier also announced they will sell 11 of their Boeing 767-200 planes to an air-cargo company, ABX Air Inc., since they are the least fuel-efficient aircraft in the fleet. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport lost 9 destinations, but the carrier said there would be no inconvenience to passengers. Delta will fly to 20 new ""business destinations"" from Atlanta and Salt Lake City, instead. Also 41 international connections are to be maintained or expanded. The changes took place due to the difficult financial situation of the company, which suffered $10 billion in losses since 2001, and warned that they would file for bankruptcy if unsuccessful in lowering costs."
business,"The co-pilot and the widow of the pilot of Comair Flight 5191 have sued the United States Federal Aviation Administration, Blue Grass Airport where the crash occurred, and Jeppesen Dataplan Inc, the manufacturer of the airport charts the pilots were using and a subsidiary of Boeing. The co-pilot was the only survivor in the disaster, which killed 49 people one year ago on August 27, 2006. The aircraft crashed after attempting takeoff on the wrong runway, which was only for general aviation and therefore not long enough for use by commercial airliners. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined last month that the primary cause of the accident was most likely pilot error. However, First Officer James Polehinke and Amy Clay, widow of Captain Jeffrey Clay, allege that all three organisations they are suing were also negligent. Despite this, one lead investigator has named other contributing factors, including staffing deficiencies in the control tower, an air traffic controller suffering from fatigue, airport charts that were out of date and the fact that vital documents warning pilots of a route change due to construction work did not reach the aircraft's flight crew. In addition to the other three companies, Polehinke is also suing the company that designed the lighting system in use at the airport. The NTSB's official probable cause for the disaster is as follows: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crewmembers’ failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane’s location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross‑check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew’s non-pertinent conversations during taxi, which resulted in a loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration’s failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances."""
business,"laborPolice raided the SsangYong Motor Company's plant in South Korea today, in order to evict workers who have been occupying the plant since May in protest of proposed layoffs. Most of the workers were those who were previously fired for opposing layoffs. 100&amp;ndash;400 police officers raided the auto plant south of Seoul at around 10:00 a.m. (local time). Police intended to evict some 600 striking workers who, according to a union representing the workers, ""will fight to the death should police forcefully break up the occupation."" Workers at the plant are resisting police by attacking them with slingshots, metal pipes and molotov cocktails. During the raid, two unnamed workers fell from the four story building while trying to stop the police from landing onto the roof from cargo containers dropped by helicopter. Both sustained injuries, with one in critical condition from the amount of blood he lost. SsangYong Motor Company has been in court-approved bankruptcy since February and is planning on laying off a third of its workforce to stay in business. However, workers say the company should provide a better proposal regarding the layoffs as well as a more reasonable compensation package for workers being laid off. The situation has caused the company to lose more than US$184 million in output."

business,"Cyprus Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris resigned yesterday due to public discontent with his handling of the negotiations over a bailout from international lenders and a state investigation into the circumstances that pushed the country close to a financial collapse. According to Cyprus based media organizations, Sarris has been succeeded by the current Labor Minister Haris Georgiades Sarris attributed his resignation to the probe announced earlier today, admitting that he may also be targeted by judges as they try to find out why the country was forced to seek a bailout. ""I believe that in order to facilitate the work of investigators the right thing would be to place my resignation at the disposal of the president of the republic, which I did,"" said Sarris, who was appointed as minister only in February. Sarris's resignation came shortly after he signed a €10 billion (US$13 billion) rescue deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that could see depositors with €100,000 lose up to 60% of their savings. An earlier version of the deal, which called for all Cypriot bank depositors to sacrifice part of their savings, was later scrapped following a wave of popular outrage. The bailout deal includes measures that strip Cyprus of its status as a financial hub and force the local government to impose limits on cash transfers lest depositors try to channel their money to banks abroad."
business,"According to published reports and information posted to the Writely.com website and blog, the service has re-opened its Writely account beta program. The Writely beta was launched in August 2005, and Google acquired the Writely technology on March 9, 2006. The core Writely service provides a free online collaborative word processor which is widely viewed as an alternative and potential competitor to more traditional locally-run word processing software. The service has claimed that thousands of people had previously registered for the service exclusively driven by word-of-mouth and the Writely blog. Shortly after being acquired by Google, the company greatly restricted the service and maintained a future customer sign up waiting list. Writely re-opened its beta service on August 17, 2006. According to the company's blog, the timing of the re-launch was due to a positive product review on CNET combined with persistent email requests asking the service to re-open. Additionally, Writely is planning to make its service available as part of the Google Account sign-in sometime on the near future. A number of industry sources have speculated on why Google chose to issue a press release on August 17, 2006 touting its involvement in a Star Trek convention and failed to release any information on the Writely beta re-open. While Google has proven reticent to release and publish product information in the past, the lack of any published information for the Writely beta re-open has generated a greater than usual number of web posts and articles addressing the subject."
business,"The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has been investigating allegations surrounding Livedoor's acquisition strategies and stock sales. Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reports that the company may have made 4 billion yen ($35 million) in profits by following illegal takeover practices. Livedoor has been known to use acquisitions to support its rapid growth. It currently owns about 50 technology companies providing financial services and other software over the internet. Recent investigations have centered around the acquisitions of two companies Royal Shinpan, a consumer finance company and Cueznet Co. an online matchmaking firm. Livedoor announced its intent to acquire the two companies in August and September of 2004. According to allegations, an investment fund was used to purchase shares in the targeted companies before the announcements were made public. It is believed that after the stock swaps in October 2004, Livedoor received the shares of the two companies through this fund. The investment fund also received new Livedoor shares in exchange which were then allegedly sold off to a foreign investment fund. Livedoor is reported to have issued 12.6 million new shares for the two stock swaps. Since Livedoor owned most of the fund, the profits from these sales were siphoned back into Livedoor. The investment fund JMAM Salvage Ichi-go Toshi Jigyo Kumiai was deemed a voluntary organization and hence avoided registration and disclosure regarding its investors and its investments. Concealing ownership of targeted takeover companies violates securities and exchange laws. A prosector commented ""Stock swaps are not illegal, but it is problematic if a company makes deals aiming to make profits by selling its shares this way."" Livedoor shares continued their fall for the fourth straight day on Friday. The stock has now lost about 52 percent or $3.3 billion in market capitalization since news of the investigation broke through on Monday evening. The Tokyo Stock Exchange(TSE) is considering delisting stocks of Livedoor Co. and its affiliate Livedoor Marketing Co. Livedoor is scheduled to submit the findings of its internal investigation to the TSE by Friday. ""If we can confirm they violated listing regulations, we'll have no choice but to decide to delist their stocks,"" TSE Chairman and President Taizo Nishimuro told reporters at a news conference.

business,"U.S. President George W. Bush signed into law Wednesday a major bankruptcy reform bill, making the most sweeping changes to the laws of personal bankruptcy in the past two decades. Bill S.256 is predicted to reduce the chances of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy for 30,000 to 210,000 families per year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. The legislation was strongly opposed by some consumer advocates and by some Democrats in Congress, who complained about the lack of debate on exemptions they attempted to introduce and tried to derail the passage of the bill. Those who are unable to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy will then be forced to file under Chapter 13, which requires payment of some debts by order of a judge based on the financial resources of the debtor. Opponents said the bill will end a chance for a fresh start in the financial lives of the American people by keeping them in debt to collection agencies, as well as credit card companies and banks who have made it easy to obtain high credit limits amid mounting consumer debt. In his remarks before signing the bill, which he supported, Bush said, ""The bipartisan bill I'm about to sign makes common-sense reforms to our bankruptcy laws. By restoring integrity to the bankruptcy process, this law will make our financial system stronger and better. By making the system fairer for creditors and debtors, we will ensure that more Americans can get access to affordable credit."" The bankruptcy bill received a 302-126 approval in the house, after receiving a 74-25 vote in the Senate last month following strong, mostly partisan debate. The US bankruptcy system was established in 1898. It allowed judges and debtors to come to terms with the costly medical bills that can follow a relative's death, or a family illness. Such cases form nearly half of all bankruptcies filed in the USA, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Now many of those people will have to work out repayment plans suitable to creditors instead of having debts erased by a judge, according to the new law, which takes effect in six months. In the past, a judge or court representative would calculate an individual's income and subtract necessities of life to come up with a practical repayment plan of some debt. The new law stipulates that a graph, showing the poverty level in whichever state the consumer is living will be the criteria. It assumes that if people can subsist at that poverty level, then everything over that can be used to repay creditors. Additionally, a provision that allowed debtors to file their own Chapter 7 fresh start bankruptcy has been changed to require a lawyer, paid by the debtor, to do the filing. The new law also erased ""usury"" provisions in lending laws, with some lawmakers saying that paying 30 percent interest was not too much when a debtor was behind on payments. But Bush said that credit will ""be more affordable because when bankruptcy is less common, credit can be extended to more people at better rates,"" meeting demands of the credit card companies which they have been pressing for the last eight years. ""The big winners under the new law will be the special interests that literally wrote it, particularly the credit card industry,"" said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""This is particularly ironic because reckless and abusive lending practices by credit card companies have driven many Americans to the brink of bankruptcy."" The forces arrayed on the losing side of this bill said it will hurt low-income working people, single mothers, minorities, and elderly and will end a safety net for people who have lost jobs or face major medical bills. People who fail (refuse) to pay or refuse to go to court will punished by a fine and or arrest warrant made out in their name. About fifty thousand Americans will be punished by a fine and or warrant about three thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike so they will be put in jail for life. But Mallory Duncan, a lawyer for the National Retail Federation, said ""Bankruptcy has gone from a stigma to a financial planning tool for many."" New personal bankruptcy filings have increased from 172,423 in 1978 to 1,599,986 last year, an increase of 828% during that time; however, it edged down slightly last year. About 2 percent to 13 percent of those who dissolve their debts in Chapter 7 bankruptcy each year in exchange for forfeiting some assets will be disqualified from doing so under the law, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Bankruptcy lawyers anticipate a rush to the courthouse to beat the six-month window before the new reforms take effect."

business,"ZimbabweZimbabwe has decided to abandon its currency, the Zimbabwean dollar, in favour of other currencies. Acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced today that Zimbabweans will be allowed to make transactions in other currencies along with the local currency. ""In line with the prevailing practices by the general public, the government is therefore allowing the use of multiple foreign currencies for business transactions alongside the Zimbabwean dollar,"" he said, adding that the Zimbabwean dollar will not be removed from circulation and would be used alongside other currencies. This decision comes during the current period of hyperinflation, which has massively devalued the Zimbabwean dollar. Banknotes up to $100 trillion have been printed, despite the removal of ten zeroes from the currency last summer to try to make transactions easier. The official inflation rate, last updated in July 2008, was 231,000,000% a year, although independent estimates place the number as high as 6.5x10108, or 6.5 quindecillion novemdecillion, percent. Up to now, only vendors with licenses were legally able to accept foreign currencies, although the practice was widespread — private businesses altogether refuse to accept the unstable Zimbabwean dollar. Large sections of the workforce, including teachers and doctors, have gone on strike because hyperinflation rapidly renders their wages worthless. Representative groups said salaries, now measured in trillions of dollars, are insufficient to pay for even the bus fare to work. Zimbabwe also faces other crises, including a cholera epidemic that has claimed the lives of over 3,000 people, according to statistics from the World Health Organisation."

The company made a profit of $64.3 million in the 13 trading weeks ending in December, down from $208.1 million last year. Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz sent a letter to employees explaining the difficulties the company is having in the current economic climate. He placed some of the blame of the loss in sales on other companies such as McDonalds and Dunkin’ Donuts, which have been improving the quality of their coffee. ""These decisions have been made to ensure the company is leaner and prepared to endure a worsening economic climate,"" said Schultz in the letter. Two-thirds of the store closures are to take place in the United States. Schultz's salary would also be reduced to $10,000 a year according to the Wall Street Journal. The closures are on top of the already 600 stores the company announced they would be closing.

business,"Ever since the Taste of Taiwan Cuisine, a complex to promote the MICE (meeting, incentive travel, conference, and exhibition) and cultural industries in Taiwan exclusively in June, made its initiation at 2006, the tourism ratio from foreigners were progressively increased in this complex event. To bring up the MICE industry, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), the event organizer, arranged several key events including Taipei Trade Shows, travel packages, views, and conferences for international businesspeople. This effectively redefined the MICE industry in Taiwan during the event. As the 2008 WiMAX Expo Taipei and COMPUTEX Taipei jointly showcased in the Taipei World Trade Center Hall 1 - 3, Taipei International Convention Center, and TWTC Nangang, the potential of ICT industry in Taiwan were demonstrated to drive more discussions between international businesspeople during the show hours and conferences. Products related to current incidents including energy-efficiency, environmental-friendly, and low-prices were highly respected from industrial businesspeople. In addition to several forums and seminars, topical issues including environment and energy-saving were also mentioned during the shows. Apart from seminars and trade shows, since the TWTC Nangang was launched on March 13, the venue brought opportunities for several industries. As the government claimed to promote the MICE industry positively, Taiwan will keep its stable position on international sourcing center in Asia with more trade shows expanded to TWTC Nangang. Culinary, historical ancestry, natural views, and country images, are key factors to demonstrate the culture of a nation. Different from them, the creativity and innovations showcased another style in its cultural industry. A good example was the organization of three theme shows for food and packaging industries - ""Food Taipei"", ""Foodtech Taipei"", and ""Taipei Pack"", a collective with different cultures from twenty-seven countries including United States, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Sri Lanka, Austria, Philippines, Chile, Malaysia, Spain, Fiji, Poland, and six nations from Africa. Not only the shows, the TAITRA also provided several special coupon cards for international businesspeople to discount in several local department stores, hotels, tourism views, and gourmet stores to rise up the tourism industry. Although the tourism industry was firmly prosper as trade shows went smoothly, but when a great shows took place at Taipei World Trade Center, it still exposed a major problem on transportation although Walter Yeh, Vice President of TAITRA, ever emphasized to improve this critical issue in a press conference.

business,"Irish national airline Aer Lingus have purchased 12 new long-haul Airbus aircraft as a means of modernising it's long-haul fleet and improving it's transatlantic network. Under the agreement, Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from 2009 to 2011, then between 2014 and 2016 it will take delivery of six new A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) aircraft, a new design currently under development by Airbus. Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by 2018. Aer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft( 24 A320s and 6 A321s) and eight long-haul A330s, and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in September 2006. The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft, but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were “better on fuel and better on range” than the 787. He also said that, although the aircraft have a catalogue value of €1.78 billion (US$2.4 billion), Airbus had offered them at an ""exceptional discounts” on them. Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft. As well as new routes to the US, Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well, saying, “We will prioritize the U.S. (but) we have an eye as to what's happening to the Far East and South Africa.” The airline already offers flights to New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dubai, and recently launched 3 new U.S. routes to San Francisco, Orlando, and Washington. Aer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange fell 2.5 percent to €2.73 ($3.68) the day the deal was announced. It will fall through unless backed by shareholders. Aer Lingus rival Ryanair has been attempting to take over Aer Lingus since December, and if this bid is successful, the new aircraft may become redundant as Ryanair intends to end transatlantic services. However, the Irish government, which holds a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus, disapproves of the takeover, as do Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 percent shares. Ryanair owns a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus. The takeover is also unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union. Mannion said of the integration of the new aircraft ""The A350 XWB fits in with our ambitious plans to expand existing routes and to open up new ones from our hub in Dublin. We already have an all Airbus fleet and the new aircraft will fit in seamlessly."""
business,"Internet Within 24-hours of posting a web advertisement for an upcoming hackathon in Boston, Massachusetts, web startup Sqoot has lost four sponsors for the event, in what has been described as the ""worst startup PR crisis in recent history."" This caused them to postpone the event and apologize in response to thousands of tweets that opposed the advert and found its content sexist. On March 20, Sqoot, an API provider that delivers daily deals like Groupon and Gilt City, posted an online advert for their upcoming Boston API Jam. The advert promoted various perks for the event, including an in-house DJ, cocktails, food trucks and access to women: women specifically there to serve beer to attendees. As soon as the ad was posted to Eventbrite, many on Twitter expressed concern. Over 3,000 tweets later, the advert was deemed sexist by many and Twitter users both condemned Sqoot and contacted the sponsors of the event. The ad, which Alex Williams of SiliconANGLE described as ""bizarre"" and ""misogynist,"" was quietly changed on Eventbrite by Sqoot, removing the mention of women as beer peddlers. In a matter of hours, four sponsors had pulled out from the Boston event: CloudMine, Apigee, Heroku, and MongoHQ. Shortly thereafter, Sqoot offered two apologies: a brief apology which was then followed by a more detailed apology stating that they desired to have a ""good party"" that was not a standard hackathon experience of pizza and keynote speakers. Sqoot stated that they ""aimed to call attention to the male-dominated tech world through humor and intended to be inclusive, the gravity of our wording was just the opposite. Our words completely undermined our intentions and went further to harm the world we're trying to have a positive impact on."" Other sponsors such as Constant Contact and Simple Relevance remained as sponsors. Shanley Kane, director of product management at Basho Technologies, supported the sponsor withdrawal and didn't just consider the advertisement sexist, but also homophobic by ostracizing gay men by promoting a seemingly ""straight"" agenda for the event. Kane also believed that Sqoot had the ""false assumption that women would not attend the event at all,"" by promoting it with a male targeted spin. In an industry that is dominated by men, it can be assumed that more men would attend the hackathon than women, but, the advertisement ostracized women even more from attending. And this wasn't Sqoot's first foray into straight male targeted marketing. Blog posts like ""Sqoot Makes You Yelp!"" featuring the Yelp logo on a woman's backside and ""Sqoot Goes Topless"" featuring an image of a topless woman, are meant to promote the opening of Yelp's API and company transparency. Alex Williams believes that the Sqoot situation shows that sexism within the tech industry is broad and growing. ""Women are marginalized and treated more as objects than as colleagues. The trend is a disturbing one and poses a serious threat to the health and diversity of the tech sector."" Techli's Kathryn Hough chocked it up to immaturity, ""Someone needs to tell young founders that frat house behavior is not acceptable in the business world. If Sqoot’s business collapses for a few sentences of sexist copy, I hope that other young founders get to see the wreckage before following them off the plank."" Lukas Blakk, a release engineer and advisory board member for The Ada Initiative, a non-profit that tries to increase female participation in technology and open source, believes that having a code of conduct in place is a necessity for businesses, and for those businesses who don't ""you’ve got a ticking time bomb in your organization’s future."" Social media is giving businesses a new challenge when it comes to marketing.

business,"Satire site Uncyclopedia, a parody of online encyclopedia Wikipedia, has been labeled by the Malaysian government as dangerous. The Internal Security Department of Malaysia issued the warning today, saying that the site has ""messages and information insulting Malaysia"". The warning notes the creation date of the website as being 5 January 2005, and hosted by Wikia, Inc., both of which are correct. However, it claims Wikia owns Wikipedia; Wikipedia is a charitable non-profit website owned by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, while Wikia is an independent, for-profit company. The report evidently mentions that Uncyclopedia covers Malaysian ""history, culture, the political leaders, the government, the national song and the name / history of the national flag,"" none of which is ""correct"". They accuse the website of helping to reinforce a bad international image of their country. There are no reports of the site being blocked from access within the country, only this statement, which urges Malaysians not to circulate the content. Uncyclopedia's article on Malaysia begins: Essentially the penis of Asia which is located to the north of their cousins who live on an even smaller island Singapore, Malaysia (also known as Bolehland) is a young nation of diverse cultures and races such as F1 Formula-1 and Nascar. The timezone of Malaysia is unique because it follows the system of +1/+2 PMT (Predetermined Meeting Time) which is 1 or 2 hours later than PMT. Most foreigners have difficulty adjusting to this new timezone as they tend to show up 1 or 2 hours earlier than the local counterparts. The nation is moving forward with a vision towards becoming a developed nation by the year 2020, 3030, 4040 or whatever catchy number. ... Another common state that Malaysians have is denial (no lah, where got?), which incidentally, is a river in Egypt. The site has fired back with a parody article posted at the site under their UnNews section, titled Uncyclopedia Internal Security Department warns on Malaysia. The article suggests that the ""Internal Security Department of the Uncyclomedia Foundation,"" which is a facetious and fictitious parent organization of Uncyclopedia, identifies Malaysia ""as a dangerous country... It warned its people not to use the country today."" There are forty-seven individual language editions of Uncyclopedia, including Tolololpedia, which is written in Bahasa Melayu, the Malay language. This is in addition to fictional ""language"" editions which include Oscar Wilde, Newspeak, N00b, White Supremacist, and Re: PharmaccgRy."
business,"Microsoft has launched its much-hyped Xbox 360 console into Japan, but unlike the European and American markets the Japanese are not rushing out to buy them. When launched in the American and European markets, stores sold out early. In Japan, sales are much lower. One store-owner says that fewer than 50 units were sold in the first 2 hours of its release. Many believe that in Japan it is difficult for any games console to be successful that isn't from a Japanese company, such as Sony or Nintendo. The first generation of Xbox consoles performed similarly possibly due to being released two years after the PlayStation 2. The large size of the console and the differing style of games was also said to have contributed. There is still some hope for the Xbox 360, Takeshi Tajima, a BNP Paribas analyst, told Reuters news agency: ""most people are going to wait and see."""
business,"economy and business The head of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, has called for a meeting to assess the trade finance situation, including the impact on developing countries. The meeting, which is schedule for November 12, will allow credit institutes and government officials to review the current trade credit situation. ""A number of WTO members, in particular developing countries, have flagged the problems they are facing in arranging trade financing,"" wrote WTO Director-General Lamy. ""The purpose of our next meeting will be to review how the international market for trade-financing is faring in view of the current very difficult conditions on international financial markets,"" he continued. Credit is vital to trade with around 90 percent of the US$14 trillion in world trade financed by credit. While this market has done well compared to other credit markets, bankers are suggesting that problems might occur shortly. Rates on these trade loans have increased by 3 percent. Developing countries have seen several recent years of positive growth but the effects of the global financial crisis on these countries have pushed growth levels down. Lamy has asked that the heads of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other regional development banks to attend. He also invited the five leading commercial banks in trade finance: Citigroup, Commerzbank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase, and HSBC. Lamy also said that work on the Doha Development Round of trade is continuing but did not say if it would be finished this year."

It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years. The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters.

business,"A controversial development training course called ""Landmark Forum"" is cited in religious discrimination lawsuits in United States federal courts in New York and Washington, D.C. The seminars are run by a San Francisco, California-based for-profit training company called Landmark Education. The company evolved from Erhard Seminars Training ""est"", and has faced criticism regarding its techniques and its use of unpaid labor. The sperm bank and surrogacy company Los Angeles-based Growing Generations is named as a defendant in the New York lawsuit, and the Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats is a defendant in the Washington, D.C. case. In separate lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, New York, and in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., former employees are suing their employers for monetary damages and claiming religious discrimination after their employers allegedly mandated that they attend courses at Landmark Education. In the US$3 million federal lawsuit filed in New York, Scott Glasgow is suing his former employer Growing Generations and its CEO Stuart Miller. Growing Generations maintains sperm banks and also arranges surrogacy for gay couples who wish to have children. The company has offices in New York and Los Angeles, and has done business with celebrities including actor B. D. Wong of Law &amp; Order: SVU. Glasgow was marketing director of Growing Generations, and claims he was fired in June 2007 after refusing to continue attending Landmark Education seminars. Glasgow is also suing for sexual harassment, and claims Miller came on to him in September 2006. He made approximately $100,000 per year as the company's marketing director, and was the company's only employee based out of New York City. The company's main offices are in Los Angeles. 4=Scott Glasgow ""I was shocked when I was fired. It took me months to right myself. I want them to stop imposing Landmark on the employees, and I want an apology,"" said Glasgow in a statement in The Village Voice. Brent Pelton, one of Glasgow's attorneys, stated that: ""The Landmark philosophy is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company"". Glasgow said that the Landmark Education training courses were ""opposite"" to his Christian beliefs. According to Glasgow he was questioned by Miller in May 2007 after he walked out of a Landmark Education course, and was fired shortly thereafter. ""We stand by the allegations contained in the complaint and we look forward to proving them at trial,"" said Pelton in a statement to ABC News. Ian Wallace, an attorney who represents Growing Generations, claimed that Glasgow wasn't fired but walked away from his position. ""Growing Generations and Mr. Miller are very confident that these claims will be dismissed ultimately, and there's no factual basis for them whatsoever,"" said Wallace in a statement to The Village Voice. Lawyers representing Growing Generations and Stuart Miller declined comment to The New York Post, and did not immediately return a message from ABC News. In Glasgow's complaint, entered into federal court record on April 18, he asserts that Landmark Education constitutes a ""religion"", and ""perceived their philosophy as a form of religion that contradicted his own personal beliefs"". He states that when he was promoted to Director of Marketing, he asked Miller if he could stop attending the Landmark sessions but was told that they were mandatory for all of the company's executives and that Landmark is ""very much the language of the company."" Glasgow said his performance at the company was assessed based on how he was ""touching, moving and inspiring"" others, a phrase from the Landmark philosophy, as opposed to his business accomplishments at the company. The complaint claims that the actions of Miller and Growing Generations violated Federal, New York State and New York City civil rights laws. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. deals with a separate plaintiff and company, but the plaintiff in the suit also claims that religious discrimination took place for allegedly being mandated to attend Landmark Education courses. Kenneth Goldman is suing the United States Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats (also 21st Century Democrats) and its former executive director Kelly Young. Goldman was formerly the communications director of 21st Century Democrats. According to Goldman's complaint, three employees of 21st Century Democrats were fired after refusing to attend the Landmark Forum course. The complaint asserts that Landmark Education has ""religious characteristics and theological implications"" which influenced the mission of 21st Century Democrats and the way the organization conducted business. Goldman's complaint states that in addition to himself, a training director and field director were also fired after they made it clear they would not attend the Landmark Forum. Goldman says executive director Young infused Landmark Education jargon terms into staff meetings such as ""create possibilities"", ""create a new context"", and ""enroll in possibilities"". He also claims that Young ""urged"" staff members to participate in Landmark Education events outside of the workplace, drove employees to and from Landmark functions, and used funds from 21st Century Democrats to pay for employees to attend those functions. Goldman's complaint asserts that he was discriminated against in violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. Landmark Education spokeswoman Deborah Beroset In a statement in The Washington Times, the executive director of 21st Century Democrats, Mark Lotwis, called the lawsuit ""frivolous"" and said: ""we're going to defend our organization's integrity"". Landmark Education spokeswoman Deborah Beroset said that the Landmark Forum ""is in no way religious in nature and any claim to the contrary is simply absurd,"" and stated: ""While we are not a party to this lawsuit and have no firsthand knowledge of it, we can only assume that we are being used as a legal and political football to further the plaintiff""s own financial interests."" The New York lawsuit was filed April 14, and is still in early filing stages. A conference with the federal court judge in the case has been scheduled for June 17. The Washington, D.C. suit began in November 2007, and entered mediation this past March. As of April 15 the parties in the case were due back to court on July 11 to update the court on the mediation process. Landmark Education is descended from Erhard Seminars Training, also called ""est"", which was founded by Werner Erhard. est began in 1971, and Erhard's company Werner Erhard and Associates repackaged the course as ""The Forum"" in 1985. Associates of Erhard bought the license to his ""technology"" and incorporated Landmark Education in California in 1991. This is not the first time employees have sued claiming mandatory attendance at ""Forum"" workshops violated their civil rights. In a lawsuit filed in December 1988 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, eight employees of DeKalb Farmers Market in Decatur, Georgia sued their employer claiming their religious freedom and civil rights were violated when they were allegedly coerced into attending ""Forum"" training sessions. ""Many of these training programs, particularly at large corporations, claim to be purely psychological, aimed at improving productivity and morale and loyalty. But in fact they are religious,"" said University of Denver religious studies professor Carl Raschke in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. The DeKalb Farmers Market employees were represented by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union. Consulting Technologies Inc., an affiliate of Transformational Technologies Inc., was named as a party in the lawsuit. Transformational Technologies was founded by Werner Erhard, and was not named as a party in the suit. The ""Forum"" course that the employees claimed they were mandated to attend was developed by Werner Erhard and Associates. Employees said that they were fired or pressured to quit after they objected to the Forum courses. The workers claimed that the Forum course contradicted with their religious beliefs. The plaintiffs in the suit included adherents of varying religious backgrounds, including Christianity and Hinduism. ""The sessions put people into a hibernating state. They ask for total loyalty. It's like brainwashing,"" said Dong Shik Kim, one of the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs said they lost their jobs after objecting to a ""new age quasi-religious cult"" which they said was developed by Werner Erhard. The DeKalb Farmers Market denied the allegations, and an attorney for the company Edward D. Buckley III told The Wall Street Journal that employees were encouraged, not coerced, to attend the training sessions. According to The Wall Street Journal, The Forum said it would not sanction workers being coerced to attend its training sessions. The parties in the DeKalb Farmers Market religious discrimination case came to a settlement in May 1989, and the case was dismissed with prejudice in June. The terms of the out-of-court settlement were not made public, but the employees' attorney Amy Totenberg told The Wall Street Journal that the case ""has made employers come to grips with the legitimate boundaries of employee training"". According to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers must ""reasonably accommodate"" their employees' religious beliefs unless this creates ""undue hardship"". In September 1988, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a policy-guidance notice which stated that New Age courses should be handled under Title VII of the Act. According to the Commission, employers must provide ""reasonable accommodation"" if an employee challenges a training course, unless this causes ""undue hardship"" for the company. In October 2006, Landmark Education took legal action against Google, YouTube, the Internet and a website owner in Queensland, Australia in attempts to remove criticism of its products from the Internet. The company sought a subpoena under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in an attempt to discover the identity of an anonymous critic who uploaded a 2004 French documentary of the Landmark Forum to the Internet. ""Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous"" (Voyage to the Land of the New Gurus) was produced by Pièces à Conviction, a French investigative journalism news program. The Electronic Frontier Foundation represented the anonymous critic and the Internet , and Landmark withdrew its subpoena in November 2006 in exchange for a promise from the anonymous critic not to repost the video. Landmark Education itself has come under scrutiny for its controversial labor practices. The company has been investigated by the United States Department of Labor in separate investigations originating out of California, Colorado, and Texas. Investigations focused on the heavy reliance of unpaid labor in the company's workforce, which Landmark Education calls ""assistants"" and deems volunteers. An investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor based out of Colorado found that activities performed by Landmark Education's ""assistants"" include: ""office, clerical, telephone solicitation and enrollment, as well as greeting customers, setting up chairs, handling microphones during the seminars and making coffee. Additionally, a number of volunteers actually teach the courses and provide testimonials during and after the courses."" The Colorado investigation's 1996 report found that ""No records are kept of any hours worked by any employees."" According to a 1998 article in Metro Silicon Valley: ""In the end the Department of Labor dropped the issue, leaving Landmark trumpeting about its volunteers' choice in the matter."" Metro Silicon Valley reported that Landmark Education at the time employed 451 paid staff, and also utilized the services of 7,500 volunteers. After an investigation into Landmark Education's labor practices by the U.S. Dept. Labor's offices out of California, the company was deemed to have overtime violations. According to the Department of Labor's 2004 report on the investigation, back wages of $187,569.01 were found due to 45 employees. An investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor in Texas which concluded in 2005 stated: ""Minimum wage violation found. Volunteers (Assistants) are not paid any wages for hours worked while performing the major duties of the firm. The assistants set up rooms, call registrants, collect fees, keep stats of classroom data/participants, file, they also are answering phones, training and leading seminars."" The Texas investigation also discovered an overtime violation. Landmark Education agreed to pay back wages for the overtime violation, but did not comply with the overtime violation found by the U.S. Dept. Labor for the ""assistants"". Landmark Education denied that the ""assistants"" are employees, though the Department of Labor report concluded: ""Interviews reveal that the employees are taking payments, registering clients, billing, training, recruiting, setting up locations, cleaning, and other duties that would have to be performed by staff if the assistants did not perform them."" According to the 2004 investigative report by Pièces à Conviction in the ""Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous"" program, Landmark Education was investigated by the French government in 1995. In the ""Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous"" program volunteers were filmed through a hidden camera and shown performing duties for Landmark Education in France including manning phones, recruitment and financial work for the company, and one volunteer was shown cleaning a toilet. Le Nouvel Observateur reported that after ""Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous"" aired in France, labor inspectors investigated Landmark Education's use of unpaid volunteers. According to Le Nouvel Observateur, one month after the labor investigation took place the French branch of the company had disbanded. A former ""Introduction Leader"" to the Landmark Forum, Lars Bergwik, has recently posted a series of videos to YouTube critical of the company and its practices. Bergwik appeared on a 2004 investigative journalism program on Sweden's Channel 4, Kalla Fakta (Cold Facts). According to Bergwik, after the Kalla Fakta program on Landmark Education aired, ""Landmark left Sweden""."
business,"Indonesia has been angered by a decision of the European Union to leave all 51 of the nation's air carriers on the list of air carriers banned in the EU. State-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia had hoped to begin flights to Europe imminently and has ordered ten new jetliners to serve routes there and to the United States. Transport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan said ""This seems like an unfair punishment for Indonesia. The EU is not a sovereign country and is not a member of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). But we do respect the EU and its decision, and demand the same from the EU."" The ban was imposed after a string of accidents, of which the three most important were Adam Air Flight 574, a 102-fatality accident in which a Boeing 737-43Q plunged into the ocean after pilots distracted by instrument failure failed to maintain control, Adam Air Flight 172, in which another B737 snapped in half after a hard landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, in which a third B737 attempted landing at extreme speed and overshot the runway, killing 21. Adam Air had also almost suffered a B737 crash the previous year, 2006, after a similar navigational instrument failure to that on Flight 574 caused the airliner to become lost for several hours, eventually performing an emergency landing hundreds of kilometres from its intended destination. Indonesia grounded the carrier in March after another accident in which a B737 overshot a runway. The carrier is also in severe financial difficulties and may soon be permanently shut down. Meanwhile, the pilot of Garuda 200 has been charged over the accident, sparking intense controversy. The EU reviewed the ban this week, but ruled that those responsible ""have still to demonstrate that they have completed the corrective actions"" needed to lift the ban. It is a blow to Indonesia, who had promised ""fast-track"" help to Garuda, Mandala Airlines, Premiair and Airfast to raise their safety to levels acceptable to the EU."
business,"Aviation The European Commission (EC) has approved yesterday a takeover of loss-making UK airline bmi from Lufthansa by International Airlines Group (IAG), owner of British Airways (BA). IAG will have to make concessions after Virgin Atlantic told the EC the deal would be anti-competitive. The deal is set to cost IAG, who also own Iberia, £172.5 million. That value could fall as budget subsidiary bmibaby may be retained by Lufthansa or sold elsewhere, and IAG are reported to be primarily interested in the main bmi business. A regional subsidiary also exists. IAG intends to use acquired slots at the busy Heathrow Airport, which serves London, to expand their own routes into Asia. The EC required IAG to surrender a number of flight slots at the airport. The slots surrendered or made available for lease are for use to destinations in Scotland, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. The EC also insisted that combined BA/bmi routing be made available for competitors to buy transfer seats upon. Lufthansa intended to shut down bmi had the bid failed. The transaction is presently scheduled for completion April 20. IAG boss Willie Walsh called the sale ""great news for Britain"" with results that are ""good for UK business and UK consumers."" Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson had previously said the move would give BA excessive dominance on Scottish flights. More Heathrow slots earmarked for Scotland have been given up than any other destination. Ryanair took the opportunity to claim only their own takeover bid for Aer Lingus has been a major EC casualty. ""Today's rubber-stamping of BA's purchase of bmi shows yet again that the EC has one rule for Europe's flag-carriers, but different rules for Ryanair"", said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary."
business,"The Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the United States of America on Monday after a test flight. One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people. It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa. A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday, but without passengers. This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport. The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number, and is due to arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 12:30 EST (16:30 UTC). The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work. Deliveries to Singapore Airlines, its launch customer, are not due until October - two years late. Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars. Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come. These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners. France will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively. The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million € (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers."
business,"Indonesian budget airline Adam Air has been given a three-week ultimatum by the authorities to prove its economic stability or its license will be revoked, said Transportation Minister Jusman Djamal. This is because major financial difficulties have become apparent today, with two major shareholders pulling out of the company. PT Global Transport Service (GTS) and Bright Star Perkasa, who between them own a 50% stake in the company, have decided to sell back all their shares to their original owners, who control the other 50%. These are the family of founder Adam Suherman and Sandra Ang. The companies invested in the airline last year, when the company was struggling after the New Year's Day disappearance of Adam Air Flight 574 with 102 on board. The Boeing 737 (B737) was ultimately determined to have crashed into the sea near Sulawesi, and all on board are presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, Adam Air Flight 172, another B737, snapped in half during a hard landing, but held together preventing fatalities. These were not the first serious accidents for the company, as in February 2006 Flight 782 became lost for several hours after navigation systems failed and the plane entered a radar blackspot, forcing a subsequent emergency landing many miles from the intended route. The given reasons for the withdrawal are a lack of improvement in safety and financial irregularities. The company has now also defaulted on debt payments to aircraft lease firms, resulting in 12 of their 22 planes being seized, and has cut the number of routes served from 52 to 12. The remaining ten planes are also in default and at risk of seizure. Adam Air owes leasing companies US$14 million compared to free capital of $4.8 million of free capital. They have agreed to buy back shares gradually for $11 million (100 billion rupiah), $6 million less than the investment firms paid for them. The cost difference will be borne by Harry Tanoesoedibyo's family, the founder of PT Bhakti Investama, of which GTS is a wholly owned subsidiary. The companies have also lost 157 billion rupiah worth of investment in the company since the April 2007 deal. 9,325 Rupiah are currently worth US$1. GTS director Gustiono Kustianto said that ""Since we joined, our priority has been safety"" but that Adam Air's management had been unresponsive to pressure from the new investors to improve its poor record. Last weeek another company B737 shot off the runway during landing, damaging the plane and injuring five. Lawyer Marx Andryan of Hotman Paris Hutapea, representing the investment firms, said they have documents proving the company has not adequatly seen to pilot recruitment, maintenance and insurance. Suherman said ""We have defaulted and the investors have done nothing about it. We'll continue to operate as long as we have planes,"" adding that there are no current plans to declare bankruptcy. ""Out of 22 planes, now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default. The other 10 have been declared in default as well, but I'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments,"" he told Reuters. He went on to say that a cash injection is required, and that ""There is a possibility starting on March 21 Adam Air will temporarily cease operations until there is a decision from the shareholders regarding the insurance premium."""
business,"Aviation After an exhaustive two year, 20 million euro ($28 million) search, the final resting spot of Air France Flight 447 has been located. The location of the wreckage is six miles north of the plane's last reported position off the coast of Brazil at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet). The wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found Sunday by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, France's Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea, confirmed to reporters: ""Bodies were found. They will be recovered and identified."" ""We weren’t prepared for that. We are now confronted with another trauma,"" Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et Solidarité AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said. Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed. ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" 4=Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, French transport minister The remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres (1,968 feet by 656 feet) area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air. Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009. According to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation. The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros ($7.1 million) according to estimates, will be financed by the French government. Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals. The operation should take between three weeks to a month. On raising the remains of the plane Troadec said: ""We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again."" Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, ""We want to know what happened in that plane."" An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying ""There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering."" Soulas of Entraide et Solidarité AF447 disagreed. ""There's a very traumatic side to this and it causes problems of identification. We don't know what state they are in."" He added, ""And it risks causing a dispute between families who want to leave the bodies at the bottom of the Atlantic and those who want them brought to the surface."" 4=Robert Soulas, VP of Entraide et Solidarité AF447 However, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two flight recorders, the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) have yet to be found at the crash site. Alain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, ""It's still a jigsaw puzzle. We do not know where the recorders might be."" There are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable. Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had ""great confidence"" in their robustness. Without the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash. The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash. The plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down."
business,"Denmark Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark, said on Tuesday that he will seek broad parliamentary support for a national referendum on joining the euro, the common currency of the Eurozone. ""I'm convinced that we need broad support in parliament to hold a referendum, because it's about the Danish currency and about stability and safety,"" he said, speaking at his weekly press conference. ""Recent events have shown the necessity to give the population the opportunity to vote on Denmark joining the euro."" Berlingske Tidende is reporting that Rasmussen is meeting with political leaders to negotiate support for the referendum. In 1992, Danish voters rejected the Maastrict Treaty in a referendum. It was only able to pass the following year after the Edinburgh Agreement granted Denmark an opt-out of the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU). In 2000, Denmark again rejected the common currency in a euro referendum. The current currency of the Scandinavian country is the Danish krone. As part of stage two of the EMU, the exchange rate of the krone is allowed to fluctuate within a ±2.25% range to the euro. In order to maintain this peg Danmarks Nationalbank, the central bank, adjusts interest rates and performs foreign exchange operations by buying and selling currency. To do this, Danmarks Nationalbank has had to raise rates twice, even as other central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), were lowering rates to deal with the current economic crisis. As a result, interest rates in Denmark are now 175 basis points higher than the ECB's rates. As recently as May, the difference was only 25 basis points. Rasmussen heads the Venstre party which leads a minority coalition government. The main opposition party, the Social Democrats, also support adopting the euro as the nation's currency. While there has long been support among the politicians, the euro has failed when it has been put before the voters. However, recent opinion polls have shown a growing support for the euro among Danes. The most recent of these have seen those in favor just topping the 50% level needed to pass a referendum. Rasmussen has said he wants a referendum put before voters before 2011. His government had originally planned to hold a referendum this past September to abolish the EMU opt-outs, but that was scrapped when Ireland voted down the Treaty of Lisbon. On October 30, while in Stockholm, Sweden, Rasmussen said: ""The euro ensures political and economical stability in Europe and the current financial turmoil makes it evident that Denmark has to join the Euro."" Analysts consulted by Berlingske Tidende have said that an endorsement from the Socialist People's Party (SF) could prove to be the tide-turner. ""If there was a vote, then I would vote Yes. But I am of the opinion that it is stupid to hold a vote unless we first have a real debate. We haven't had a debate in eight years and all arguments need to be tested,"" said Margrete Auken of SF."
business,"AustraliaThe Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has announced it will take the unprecedented step of conducting a special review of flag carrier Qantas after three separate emergencies in two weeks. In the latest incident, a Boeing 767 headed from Sydney to Manila was forced to turn back yesterday after ground staff at the airport noticed what they believed to be smoke emanating from the jet's wing as it departed. It turned out to be fine spray from a hydraulic fluid leak, and the aircraft brought its 200 passengers back down safely at around 3:00 p.m., with ARFF trucks on standby. Despite the aircraft being forced to turn around, the pilot did not request a priority landing and so Qantas refused to describe the event as an emergency landing. Qantas has a largely good safety record, having never lost a jet aircraft or had a fatality on board one. Their last fatal accident was in 1951. However, recently two other events have led to some questioning of Qantas from within the aviation industry. Last Monday, a Qantas Boeing 737-800 returned to Adelaide after experiencing pressurization problems caused by the failure of an undercarriage door to retract properly. This followed the July 25 accident on board Flight 30, a Boeing 747 headed from London to Melbourne that had just made a stopover in Hong Kong, in which an exploding oxygen cylinder caused an explosive decompression. An emergency landing was performed in Manila, with a hole blown in the aircraft's side. According to Qantas staff, the problems are not a new thing. Qantas flight attendants have asked senior management for an emergency meeting over these latest events. The Flight Attendants' Association of Australia's president Steven Reed said ""We want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents. Or are they something we should be concerned about? We need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances."" Such a meeting is said to be likely within a week. Qantas engineers have been complaining for some time about maintenance issues, saying that cost-cutting and outsourcing are compromising the quality of maintenance. Much work is now being done in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. According to one engineering union official, recent incidents linked to outsourced maintenance include a failure of emergency lighting and flight attendants in the galley being electrocuted by faulty wiring. According to the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers' Association's assistant federal secretary, Wayne Vasta, there has been a recent ""change in culture"" at Qantas, although he did say it would be inappropriate to blame only outsourcing. He said that while previously Qantas engineers had simply attempted to do the best they could, ""Now it appears we have got to do the best job we can possibly do, within a budget."" He also expressed a welcoming of the CASA probe. Qantas' engineers are currently lobbying for a pay rise, and say the airline is risking safety with cost cuts. Peter Gibson, spokesperson for CASA, said no trouble had been spotted in recent safety audits of Qantas, but they felt it 'prudent' to investigate given the recent string of incidents. He acknowledged that the review is unprecedented in CASA's history, and announced the probe would be headed by senior official Mick Quinn. ""We want to look at their safety systems to make sure that the systems are operating the way they should. All these things are stated in manuals. We want to make sure that what is in the manuals is being done,"" Gibson told reporters. He said the investigation should take around two weeks."

The M3 is a measure of money supply in the United States, The M3 is most general of the many measures of money supply, the quantity of money available within the economy for purchasing goods, services, and securities. The money supply is monitored and adjusted by a central bank, to keep inflation in check, because money supply has to change in tune with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to prevent inflation (or deflation). In November last year, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would cease publishing M3 data, saying, ""the M3 does not appear to convey any additional information about economic activity that is not already embodied in M2 and has not played a role in the monetary policy process for many years"", adding that the costs of collecting the data required for the index outweighed its benefits. Some commentators have questioned this decision and have speculated that this would allow the Federal reserve to covertly fund the US budget deficit and its negative balance of trade or hide the fall in international demand for the US dollar. In March, 2006, Rep. Ron Paul introduced a bill (HR 4892) requiring the Federal Reserve to reverse its decision. Money supply"

The airline will also cease its Sydney to Prosperine route in July 2008 and Melbourne to Darwin route in August 2008 in order to cut costs due to the airline's rising fuel bill. Virgin Blue's fuel costs have risen above A$500 million, which is up 21 per cent as compared to the last financial year. The cut backs will also see 4 of the airline's aircraft removed from its fleet and an immediate wage freeze to all management staff.

Two Bolivian military pilots are also among those killed in the accident, which happened in the Los Yungas area, northeast of the capital city, La Paz. The aircraft had been missing since Thursday and was found on Saturday morning according to a general in the Bolivian Air Force, who added the light Cessna aircraft hit a tall tree and then impacted the ground. Robert Brockmann, a U.N. spokesperson in Bolivia, said the aircraft ""was completely destroyed and burned."" Investigators have not yet determined what caused the accident, but Brockmann said the aircraft was in an area with overgrown trees and steep cliffs.

business,"A former employee of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority was sentenced on Monday to one year in prison for stealing fines from the agency. Thirty-four-year-old Uganda T. Harris from Bellwood was accused of embezzling over $36,000 from the tollway authority in a period of six months. She pleaded guilty to the charges in June. She is to report to the DuPage County jail on November 30 to begin a one-year work-release program that only allows her out to work 40 hours per week. She will also serve four years of probation and will be required to pay the agency $1,000 for insurance coverage in addition to the more than $36,000 she allegedly stole. Harris had worked as a customer service representative since June 2007. An audit by the tollway authority's inspector general's office revealed that she incorrectly classified the fines she collected as coming from I-PASS users, who pay lesser fines, and pocketed the cash. The Illinois State Police later caught Harris with $1,100 in marked $20-bills they used to pay a phony fine during an undercover investigation. She claimed that she did this only rarely and to help those people in desperate need of relief from what she saw as high tollway fines."

Sellers with low feedback, or who list specific items, such as computer software are already required to accept payment via PayPal. Under the new policy, sellers will however still be able to accept payments via other services, provided they are on eBay's approved list.

business,"TransportBritish rail company South West Trains (SWT) is to cut 180 jobs. The franchisee for lines out of London's Waterloo station has already announced 480 job cuts. The redundancies affect front line staff in ticket offices and at stations and further managers and administrators. Bus firm Stagecoach Group,SGC which runs South West Trains and East Midlands Trains, says that cuts are required because predicted passenger growth will now not happen. SWT's subsidy from the government is falling from £61 million in 2008 to £23 million this year. The subsidy becomes a premium payment next year, with over £36 million to be paid by SWT in 2010. Train crew and maintenance staff will not face redundancy and the number of services, which are generally mandated by the Department for Transport, will not be reduced. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union condemned the job cuts. Bob Crow, the union's general secretary, said “SWT’s attacks on its staff and passengers are eating into the very fabric of the railway they are supposed to be running, and they must be stopped"". He said that the RMT wanted to ensure there were no compulsory redundancies but that ""the company seems to be heading towards a ballot for strike action"". Crow also restated the union's longstanding demand for the railways to be renationalised, saying ""South West Trains has shown itself to be incapable of running a railway for the benefit of its passengers and the economy, and it is time for the franchise to come back into the public sector"". SWT's statement on the cuts said ""The company will continue to review its operation and take any further steps required to ensure it has a secure business for the long-term. Our priority will remain maintaining services to our customers, protecting jobs for the majority of our people and providing a strong foundation for growth when the economy improves."""
business,"The U.S. economy and its currency as an instrument of world trade has suffered a series of major setbacks in recent months. Some analysts say that the Federal Reserve's September 18th dramatic rate cut to 4.75% from 5.25% may be a case of ""too little, too late"", or that it was excessive and dooms the dollar. Today, Saudi officials declined to cut interest rates in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve for the first time in decades. According to Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, International Business Editor for The Daily Telegraph, ""it's a signal that the oil-rich Gulf kingdom is preparing to break the dollar currency peg in a move that risks setting off a stampede out of the dollar across the Middle East."" Hans Redeker, the Currency Chief at BNP Paribas, also stated today that Saudi Arabia's move to not adjust their own interest rates in sync with the Fed's cuts is a very dangerous situation for the US dollar. Redeker points out that ""Saudi Arabia has $800bn (£400bn) in their future generation fund, and the entire region has $3,500bn under management. They face an inflationary threat and do not want to import an interest rate policy set for the recessionary conditions in the United States."" Saudi central bank officials said that ""appropriate measures"" would be taken to stop the large capital inflows into the country. The Federal Reserve's half-point rate cut has already caused a plunge in the world dollar index to a fifteen-year low, reaching the weakest level ever against the Euro at just under $1.40. The Fed hopes that by making it cheaper to borrow, people will start spending and investing more. However, some analysts fear the cut will worsen inflation, making it harder to get personal loans, and further decrease confidence in the dollar around the world. There are already signs that global investors have started rejecting U.S. Treasury securities, and recent U.S. government data on foreign holdings show a decline in purchases of US securities from $97bn to just $19bn in July. In response to Ben Bernanke's statements today about a potential mortgage and housing market crisis, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer said, ""If adjustable mortgage rates go up, people may not be able to afford their mortgage payments."" Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said earlier this week that housing prices may fall by ""double digits"" as the subprime crisis bites harder, prompting households to cut back sharply on spending. Jim Rogers, the economic commentator and former partner of George Soros, stated, ""If Ben Bernanke starts running those printing presses even faster than he's already doing, we are going to have a serious recession. The dollar's going to collapse, the bond market's going to collapse. There's going to be a lot of problems."" In recent months, the U.S. dollar has taken several other significant hits including Kuwait's decision in May to also break its dollar peg, and threats by China to interfere with the U.S. economy, calling it their nation's ""nuclear option"". According to public sources, the Chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the United States, hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries if Washington imposes trade sanctions that seek to force a Yuan revaluation."

business,"United Kingdom On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) announced US-based taxi booking application Uber would not get a renewed private hire operator license after their current permit expires at the end of the month. The regulatory body released an official statement on their website and stated Uber London Limited was ""not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license"". TfL said Uber London ""demonstrated a lack of corporate responsibility"" for reporting serious criminal offences, and for obtaining background of the drivers and medical certificates. In August, police said Uber allowed a driver despite allegations of sexually assaulting a passenger. The company has been accused of sexism and bullying. TfL in its statement also complained about possible use of ""greyball"" software to prevent officials from accessing the application for law enforcement duties. According to Uber's statistics, about 3.5 million people in London use Uber. There are some 40 thousand drivers tied with Uber within the British capital. Per the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998, Uber can appeal against TfL's decision within three weeks. Uber received an interim renewal for four months in May, and it is set to expire at the end of the month. To this announcement, Uber London's General Manager Tom Elvidge said, ""By wanting to ban our app from the capital Transport for London and the Mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport. To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts."" He also added, ""This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers."" TfL said Uber's irresponsibility could compromise the safety and security of the public. In contrast, Uber's response said their service enhances safety. London mayor Sadiq Khan, on Facebook, said, ""...all companies in London must play by the rules and adhere to the high standards we expect &amp;mdash; particularly when it comes to the safety of customers. Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security. I fully support TfL's decision &amp;mdash; it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety and security. Any operator of private hire services in London needs to play by the rules."" Uber has received criticism from traditional taxi drivers as well as government officials. Uber was banned from Bulgaria and Denmark, and faces regulatory issues in France, Italy, Hungary, and Spain. It also faced legal inquiry for use of greyball in the US to resist government regulation of the application. Regarding the complaint about improper use of use of Greyball, Elvidge cited an independent review and said it ""found that 'greyball' has never been used or considered in the UK for the purposes cited by TfL"".

business,"Aviation Canadian airline Air Canada has said that it will be laying off 1,010 machinists seconded to work at the Aveos Fleet Performance aircraft maintenance company. The layoffs will take place in April and June, with 470 and 540 workers to be laid off in each month, respectively. They will affect some 445 workers in Montreal, 345 in Winnipeg, and 220 in Vancouver; 195 layoffs are to be permanent and the other 815 temporary. The layoffs reflect reduced demand for maintenance of the Airbus A319 and A320 planes in Air Canada's fleet, according to the Canadian Press. Mitigation efforts by the company meant that there would be fewer workers permanently laid off, but at the cost of more temporary layoffs. A spokesman for Aveos, Michael Kun, commented that some of the people temporarily laid off could return to work by July. ""We will be recalling them within eight months, starting in July,"" Kun said, as quoted by the Canadian Press."
business,"Irish low cost airline, Ryanair, announced today that it is exercising its options with Boeing to purchase five new 737 aircraft. This brings Ryanair's total number of outstanding orders with the US manufacturer to 230. The new planes, which come from the 737-800 range, will be fitted with blended winglets to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 3%. Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, justified his choice of Boeing by saying, ""The Boeing 737-800 has the best technical reliability and ensures that Ryanair is the number one on-time major airline in Europe""...""In addition, it has the lowest unit operating cost. The addition of these five aircraft will continue to enable us to develop more new routes across Europe and bring low fares to many more European consumers."" Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 on order."

business,"A Chinese cargo ship was fired on and sunk by a Russian cruiser last Sunday near Russia's far-eastern port of Vladivostok. Eight out of 16 crew members on board were saved while the others remain missing. According to Natalia Gelashvili, a spokeswoman for the Far East Transport Prosecutors office in Nakhodka, the cargo ship New Star fled on Feb. 12 after the shipment of rice it unloaded was rejected by the buyer, who then requested the court to seize the ship while suing for damages. But the Beijing based Global Times reported that the ship was sequestered for alleged smuggling. Russian Federal Security Service spokeswoman Natalya Rondaleva confirmed that the ship was fired upon by Russian vessels. An unnamed source asserts that warning shots were fired before more direct shots were taken. The ship began sinking while being escorted back to the port. The sinking of the boat forced all 16 crew members to abandon the ship by taking two life boats. One boat carrying eight people was saved by Russian sailors while the other was engulfed in the waves. The missing crew include seven Chinese and one Indonesian. The Canadian Press reports that they are presumed to have drowned. ""The cause of the sinking isn't clear because the incident occurred during a storm,"" said Captain Veniamin Ivanichev of the Marine Rescue Center in Vladivostok. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today said it asked Russia to investigate the ""mishap"" and identify the cause as soon as possible. All the rescued crew members have gone back to Nakhodka while the Russian keep looking for the missing sailors. The Russian News Agency said the coast guard found only an empty boat in a three-day search. China's foreign spokeswoman Jiang Yu declined to comment on the Russians' opening fire on the ship. The ship was registered in Sierra Leone, and the owner is a shipping company based in Hong Kong."
business,"An Intel spokesperson confirmed Thursday that Dell would no longer be offering servers with Intel Itanium CPUs. The spokesperson said ""Losing Dell as an Itanium customer is unfortunate but frankly, we see their impact as negligible."" Servers with Itanium CPUs are no longer promoted on Dell's website, though a few can be found by searching. Dell is the largest seller of computers with Intel processors. Dell currently sells 10.5 percent of all servers worldwide. The majority of Dell servers use an IA-32 (colloquially ""x86"") chip, but a growing number use the 64-bit Intel Xeon. Sales of Itanium servers have been very poor; last year Dell sold only 1,371 Itanium servers, up from 12 the previous year. In February, IBM also phased out Itanium-based servers, replacing them with IBM Power CPUs. Fujitsu, HP, Hitachi NEC, SGI and Unisys are the only major manufacturers to still offer Itanium-based servers. The Intel Itanium was designed in the early 1990s. It was intended to be the processor of choice for 64-bit computers, but the processor suffered from several major flaws preventing widespread adoption. Unlike competing AMD64 chips, the Intel Itanium uses a different instruction set from IA-32 chips. An emulation feature allows them to run IA-32 code, but only very slowly; users were forced to choose between accepting greatly-reduced performance and expending time and programmers' salaries porting their software. Even Intel has acquiesced to AMD's leadership in this field, designing chips with a compatible EM64T technology."
business,"The leu, Romania's national currency, continues to appreciate against the euro and the US dollar after it reached high levels a few days ago. Yesterday, one euro could be bought for just 35,844 lei, down from 36,133 lei two days ago. These rates are also significantly stronger from the period in mid-2004 when the euro was worth more than 40,000 lei. Last week, the leu reached such a high rate against the euro that the National Bank of Romania had to intervene and restore the exchange rate back to around 37,000 lei per euro. The leu's growth also had an impact on global exchange rates, weakening the US dollar worldwide by 1%. The National Bank, however, is hesitant to intervene in the marketplace once again due to the positive effects of the leu's appreciation on importers, who can now get products for lower prices, and for consumers, who now have higher purchasing power for imported goods. Romanians are also pleased that their currency, which has faced long periods of fairly sharp depreciation in the 1990s due to high inflation, is finally picking up again and strengthening against other currencies. The leu's appreciation, however, isn't all positive, because it is putting a great deal of pressure on exporters. Other countries are finding Romanian exports more expensive, and therefore less competitive, due to the leu's appreciation, and this could widen the already large account deficit in the country. Analysts predict, however, that the leu's surge cannot be stopped and it will continue strengthening against the euro, reaching a rate of 34,000 lei for one euro in the next week. The current leu will be replaced in July 2005 with the New Leu (RON), with 10,000 old lei = 1 New Leu. The revaluation is expected to prepare Romania for adoption of the euro in 2012. Starting from next month, all Romanian prices must be shown in both the old currency and the new currency. The National Bank of Romania has said that it expects the exchange rate between the New Leu and the euro to hover at around 3.5 RON = 1 euro when the RON is introduced."

business,"Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the 2008 model year, when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model. Mulally says that Ford's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable. As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in the future. The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the ""boxy"" cars of the 70s and 80s. The Taurus survived for four generations, selling over 7,500,000 units. The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006, after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers. ""How can it go away?"" Alan Mulally remembered asking, ""It's the best-selling car in America."" While it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400,000 plus units a year blockbuster like the Taurus, it is expected to make sales more solid, and to make the car well known, since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country."
business,"The solar-powered airplane Solar Impulse touched down at the Brussels National Airport late Friday night, after completing a 13-hour flight from its home base in Payerne, Switzerland. It was the first international flight by a fully solar-powered aircraft. The experimental aircraft was piloted by André Borschberg, co-founder and chief engineer for the Solar Impulse project, which hopes to circumnavigate the globe using only the sun's energy in 2013. ""Our goal is to create a revolution in the minds of people...to promote solar energies -- not necessarily a revolution in aviation,"" Bertrand Piccard, the group's other co-founder, said in an interview after the flight. The aircraft collects energy from the sun using 12,000 extremely thin solar cells affixed to the wings and tail section. An on-board battery can store enough electricity to fly all night, allowing the Solar Impulse to stay aloft indefinitely. This allowed the aircraft to maintain a holding pattern over the Brussels airport as other flights landed and conditions were right for the Solar Impulse to land. Because the aircraft weighs only about 3,500 pounds and has a wingspan of 200 feet, it is extremely sensitive to wind and needs calm conditions to land safely."
business,"The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) has called for industrial action on New Year's Eve over staffing levels on the London Underground. Union members voted more than five to one in favour of the strike. The vote for industrial action is because of ""back-door attempts to displace hundreds of safety-critical station staff under spurious cover,"" said Bob Crow, RMT General Secretary, to the BBC. ""The RMT will not accept any dilution of safety standards either for our members, or Tube users and we hope that the travelling public will join us in calling on London Underground to step back from the brink and start talking to us seriously."" Following the vote, the RMT called for a 24-hour strike beginning at noon on New Year's Eve, and if necessary a second 24-hour action to begin 6:30 p.m. Sunday, 8 January. Transport for London announced a meeting with the RMT at ACAS(The Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service) after the results of the vote were announced. The London Underground responded to the move, pointing to the agreement made last year with the RMT which agreed to shorter working weeks so long as there is no additional cost to Tube fare payers. ""There are no staff cuts across the Tube network,"" the spokesperson said. ""There can be no justification for the RMT now reneging on its agreement and trying to ruin New Year's Eve for thousands of Londoners,"" London Mayor Ken Livingstone said."
business,"Bruce McCaffrey, who was formerly the vice-president in charge of freight operations in the United States for Australian flag carrier Qantas, has been sentenced to eight months imprisonment and fined US$21,000 by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for his involvement in a major air cargo price fixing cartel. McCaffrey is one of six past and present employees of the airline who have been charged over the arrangement, which is thought to have run for six years starting in 2000. He is also the first individual to be sentenced regarding the cartel. He, as well as Stephen Cleary, group general manager for freight in Sydney, Harold Pang, general manager for freight sales in Singapore, Peter Frampton, former group general manager for freight, John Cooper former general manager for freight sales and Desmond Church, a former freight employee, were all charged after being exempt from immunity granted in a plea bargain by Qantas in which the airline paid a US$61 million fine. In Australia price fixing is not actually a criminal offense, so former head of freight Peter Frampton and three other staff members in Australia will not be extradited to face charges. Meanwhile, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is seeking admittances of guilt from airlines whose operations fall under its jurisdiction in exchange for lighter penalties. Qantas is amongst those airlines. The cartel, which prevented competition in air freight shipments rates, is said to involve almost thirty airlines. As well as Qantas, Japan Airlines, British Airways, Korean Air and Lufthansa have all had their involvement confirmed. Whistleblower Lufthansa, a German airline, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for exposing the operation. In August, British Airways and Korean Air pled guilty to their involvement and received fines of US$300 million each. Last month Japan Airlines also admitted to their role and paid a US$110 million fine. Amongst the others alleged to be involved are Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Hundreds of Australian businesses are involved in a class action suit against these seven airlines for AU$200 million that they believe was unfairly charged to them as a result of criminal activity. McCarthy, who ran Qantas's Australia-US cargo route for twenty years, entered a plea bargain with the authorities. Under the US Sherman Act he could have faced up to a US$1.06 million fine and up to 10 years imprisonment, but the DoJ says that the maximum fine could actually be double the gain from the offences committed or double the loss of those victimised if either were found to be higher than the normal maximum. According to the case, he was involved with ""meetings, conversations and communications in the US and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the US"". In light of the news, shares in Qantas fell 3¢ to AU$3.41."
business,"USAThe United States Labor Department reported that U.S. employers cut 533,000 jobs in November, the largest such monthly cut in 34 years. In another indication of the worsening economic situation in the U.S., the unemployment rate reached a 15-year high of 6.7 percent, from 6.5 percent in October. It was the largest job loss in a single month since December 1974, when 604,000 jobs were cut. More job cuts have been announced since these figures were compiled, with 12,000 job cuts expected at telecommunications company AT&amp;T.

business,"The Japanese whaling fleet is reportedly heading into the seas around Antarctica, drawing widespread condemnation from campaigners. Japan's fleet of six ships left the port of Shimonoseki, western Japan with a quota of 940 minke whales and 10 fin whales. Calls for the Australian government to intervene have been rejected by the environment minister, Senator Ian Campbell. Japan's whaling program, which is claimed to be for scientific purposes, is expected to kill nearly one thousand whales this season. ""Japan's attempt to dress up its commercial whaling as science is an insult to modern science,"" said International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Director of Wildlife and Habitat. ""It's time for the Japanese Government to respect the rest of the world - It's time to stop whaling."" A Greenpeace statement dismisses the assertion of the Japanese government that whales are contributing to the collapse of fish stocks. Senator Rachel Siewrt, spokesperson on marine matters for the Green Party said, ""Mr Campbell can't answer a simple question on whether or not the Government plans to take any one of a number of legal and diplomatic actions open to it."" Legal action open to the Australian government includes invoking provisional measures under the auspices of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. These measures would &amp;mdash; in effect &amp;mdash; be an injunction preventing whaling from being started within the 14 days following. In December, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society will engage the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The Sea Shepherds say the Japanese whale kill is illegal. They will be acting in accordance with the United Nations World Charter for Nature in their intervention. The groups objective is to ""hunt down the Japanese whaling fleet and harass, block, obstruct, and intervene against their illegal whaling operations."" According to Sea Shepherd: ""The Japanese are violating the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. They are violating the International Whaling Commission moratorium on commercial whaling. They are targeting endangered fin and humpback whales that are protected under the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna. They are also in violation of the Australian laws protecting the Australian Antarctic Territorial waters."" International Fund for Animal Welfare condemns what it calls a ""mass killing program — a defiance of international criticism and a global ban on commercial whaling — as commercial whaling disguised as science."" IFAW urges the Australian Government to take Japan to the international courts to bring this program to an immediate halt. Japan plans to kill over 900 minke whales and ten fin whales during the next six months as part of its whaling program, JAPRA II, marking a sharp escalation in Japan's whaling activities. ""It is a dark day for some of the world's most magnificent creatures. Let's be under no illusion—this is commercial whaling in disguise. The Australian Government must respond swiftly by taking legal action to stop the boats in their tracks,"" said IFAW Marine Campaigner Darren Kindleysides. Southern Ocean whaling season (2005-2006) Leading international law expert, Professor Don Rothwell, has advised IFAW that the Japanese Government is breaching international laws with JARPA II. He has advised that the Australian Government has very strong grounds to take Japan to in the International Law of the Sea to stop ""scientific"" whaling. Japan is targeting whales that are listed as endangered. He argues that Japan's plans to double its whale take are an abuse of its legal right. ""The number of whales that Japan purports to take is not commensurate with the number of whales that would be necessary to engage in scientific research,"" he said. ""There's also increasing evidence that non-lethal means can be used to take data from whales to obtain information about whaling stocks."""
business,"The Romanian government has drafted legislation pertaining to tax evasion that makes it a criminal offence on the same level as crimes against individuals. Developed with the aid of Romania's business community, the new law is expected to reduce corruption and tax evasion. According to the new law, the maximum jail term for tax evasion will be boosted up to 20 years. This sentence, however, will only be passed in circumstances of large-scale fraud. For evasion of up to the equivalent of 10,000 euro, the punishment will be either a fine or up to 2 years in prison. For tax fraud of up to 500,000 euro, the term will be extended to 2-8 years in prison. It is only for those whose tax evasion exceeds 1 million euro that the jail term will range between 10 and 20 years. In the same package of legislation, the government approved several changes to banckruptcy law, which makes it easier for businesses to file for bankruptcy. The new laws are expected to make Romania's business environment cleaner, resulting in more foreign investment, less corruption and more revenue for the government. At the start of the year, the Romanian government introduced a new flat tax system for Romania, in which the tax rate is 19% for both personal income and corporate profit. This has led Romania to have one of the most liberal tax policies in Europe. The lower rate of tax has already reduced fiscal evasion to a significant extent because more people and businesses are encouraged to pay the tax. However, in order to further reduce the grey economy in Romania, advisers said at the start of the year that the government must also back this up with tougher legislation against tax evasion. Previously, Romania's tax evasion laws were fairly lax, leading to quite a significant extent of tax fraud. Now, with the new, highly-publicised tax evasion laws, it is expected that the risk of getting prosecuted for not paying an already-low tax rate will force many businesses out of the black market into the legal economy."

business,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stock market index used to gauge the performance of American stock exchanges, fell 344.65 at the close of trading Thursday. The exact reason for the drop is unknown, with different news agencies pointing to different causes. The New York Times cites a rise in unemployment numbers released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor and a fall in retail sales released by several large corporations. According to the Associated Press, the number of people claiming weekly unemployment benefits rose 15,000 last week to 444,000, which, according to The New York Times is near a five-year high. “This morning’s employment numbers continue to indicate that the labor sector remains soft at best and looks to continue to shed jobs throughout the remainder of the year,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments, said in a statement to The New York Times. One major corporation that posted a gain in sales was Wal-Mart, with a 3 percent boost, which resulted in a one penny loss in their stock. Fellow retailer Target posted a sales loss. Shares of energy companies ExxonMobil and Chevron fell by 1.5 and 3 percent, respectively. The other two major American stock indices fell too. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.99 percent while the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.20 percent. The Dow's 344.65-point fall left the index at 11,188.23, a 2.99 percent decrease from the close of trading Wednesday. According to The New York Times, the drop is the largest since June of this year, but an expected announcement Friday of August unemployment data could cause the index to rise. The New York Times and the Associated Press both report that the number of jobs in the service sector rose in August according to research done by the Institute for Supply Management. This is the first rise in the number of jobs in several months. CNNMoney.com points to the rise in the price of Treasury bonds as a reaction to data released Wednesday that the American economy would continue to be slow in 2009."

business,"Indonesia Police in Indonesia have forwarded a 200-page brief concerning the Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 disaster to prosecutors. The move comes as an indication that the trial of pilot-in-command Captain Marwoto Komar is set to commence within weeks. The March 7, 2007 crash of a Boeing 737-400 at Yogyakarta International Airport killed 21 people. 119 others were able to escape the burning wreckage after the plane overshot the runway, going through the perimeter fence and crossing a road and an embankment to come to rest in a paddy field. Most of the deceased were Indonesians, with five from neighbouring Australia also killed. A final report was later issued after an investigation by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) in October 2007. The report blamed pilot error for the crash, finding that the airliner had touched down at roughly twice the accepted safe landing speed, and that Komar was ""fixated"" on landing and ""probably emotionally aroused"". The Cockpit Voice Recorder indicated that he ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System and a call from his co-pilot for a 'go-around' as the plane touched down. A number of other criticisms were also leveled at the airport, the airline and transport politicians for contributing factors. Komar is to be prosecuted over the crash for negligence. His earlier arrest - which he was subsequently released from pending full charges - sparked protests from Indonesian aviation groups and criticism from international groups, including IFALPA, a powerful international airline pilots' association. Evidence in his trial is set to include documentational evidence and aircraft wreckage, but it is unclear whether it will include the NTSC report. Much controversy was caused by the suggestion it may be used, since international regulations limit the use of materials intended for safety investigations as evidence to prove liability in criminal or civil cases. Kamal Firdaus, council for the pilot, explained what this means for his client: ""Today the documentation has been officially accepted by the prosecutor,"" adding, ""I suspect from this it will be two to three weeks until it is handed over to the court - that's the usual practice. Usually the first hearing is two weeks after that."" Firdaus commented that it would be ""difficult"" for liability to be established and that, ""we are ready and it will be a very interesting legal case, so let's see what will happen in the court."" Komar, 45, is believed to be the first pilot prosecuted over an air accident in Indonesia despite the country's poor aviation safety record. He is being charged with three counts of negligence, but the potential sentence is unclear, as Aero-News reports that he could face life imprisonment while The Age says he can face up to seven years' imprisonment. His case is considered a landmark, with aviation groups believing his trial may set the precedent for pilots involved in future accidents."

business,"New Zealand The Reserve Bank of New Zealand wrote to retails banks warning them that there will be a shortage on 20 cent coins (NZ$0.20) leading up to Christmas. They have now announced that they have distributed 4.75 million new twenty cent coins in the past week alone ""...close to the number issued in a typical year."" Ten million new coins are expected to arrive in the next few days. The Reserve Bank is wondering where all the new coins went, just five weeks after the new design was first introduced. Brian Lang, currency manager for the Reserve Bank, said: ""The pattern of demand for new coins has been markedly different to that for the old coins."" He suggests that people are keeping them in jars, like the old design coins. Some stores are already unable to give out twenty cent coins as they don't have any according to the Newmarket Business Association. Mr Lang said: ""To put this into perspective, by 30 November, the Bank had issued almost as many 20c coins (49.6m) as 10c coins (53.0m). In the past issue of 20 cent coins would normally have been about half the amount of 10 cent coins."" The head of Newmarket Business Association, Cameron Brewer, said: ""...the Reserve Bank told us that they'd done a lot of work and that everything was going to be just fine. Well here we are just five weeks into the new coins and only days away from the Christmas rush, and the country's running out of its own currency.""

Several factors could be to blame for the loss, one being Turkey's government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into Iraq in an attempt to take out militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history, with the highest record being just over US$89.00, which was set on October 18. Fears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead Caterpillar Inc., which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop, and the American economy to be severely hurt. On Friday their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $73.57. Investors and experts of the markets are disturbed by the losses calling the situation ugly. ""It's pretty ugly. A company like Caterpillar should be a poster child for global growth and benefits of the weak dollar. It makes you question: Is global growth really that strong? Has the earnings kick from the weak dollar played itself out?"" said Bell Curve Trading chief strategy expert, Bill Strazzullo. Others believe that the losses were a way of emotionally responding to the events of 'Black Monday.' ""Some of the earnings reports were a little disappointing but not that bad. I think we're responding emotionally to the 20th anniversary of the October 1987 stock market crash. I'd like to laugh except it hurts,"" said T Rowe Price Head trader, Andy Brooks. The NASDAQ also took heavy losses to close down 74.15 points or -2.64%, closing at 2,725.16. The S&amp;P 500 was also hit hard, losing 39.45 points, or -2.56%, closing at 1,500.63."
business,"Aviation On Monday, an Air France Airbus A380, operating as Air France Flight 007, collided with a Comair Bombardier CRJ-700, operating as Comair flight 553/Delta Connection flight 6293 in Delta Connection livery, on a taxiway at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. The A380 had 520 people onboard, and the smaller plane had 66. The Comair jet had just arrived from Boston Logan International Airport, and was stopped on the tarmac, awaiting a gate to offload passengers. The A380 was preparing to depart for Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, and was taxiing along a taxiway when its wingtip struck the tail of the other plane. The impact spun the CRJ around 90 degrees and resulted in some damage to both planes. A passenger on board the A380 said that ""It really felt just like a speedbump or like hitting a pothole&amp;mdash;a jolt&amp;mdash;but it didn't feel right it felt like that shouldn't be happening."" LiveATC.net captured the recording of the flight deck and ground control communications before and after the incident. In the recording, one can hear controllers giving taxi instructions to the Air France plane, then later a controller calling for emergency personnel to the intersection of taxiways Alpha and Mike. The National Transportation Safety Board plans to investigate the incident, and will study the flight recorders, air traffic control recordings, and data from radar on the ground."
business,"transport A 39-year old woman, Lakeysha Beard, talked for more than half a day while on an Amtrak train going from Oakland, California to Portland, Oregon. The loud cellphone conversation lasted sixteen hours last Monday, after which police stopped the train for twenty minutes at Salem, Oregon to arrest the woman. According to the British newspaper Daily Mail, Amtrak has no policy forbidding passengers from talking on the phone on a moving train. In the train's car, a few passengers asked the woman to put the phone away or to stop a few times during the conversation prior to notifying the train staff. Staff members were unable to convince the woman to end the conversation and stopped the train to arrest the woman and halt the disruption. As British newspaper Metro mentioned, this cellphone conversation doesn't beat the record 51-hour phone call by Sunil Prabhakar of New Delhi in 2009. Sydney, Australia etiquette expert Alex Travers, remarking on a train incident in March, said there is a lack of respect for public transportation from younger generations. The U.S. woman in the current incident, Lakeysha Beard, is 39 years old. Travers said, ""I'm afraid we are all in a very bad place as far as we feel about our public transport. People think poorly of it, so therefore they are getting on it with a poor attitude."" She called youths ""me-oriented"" and said that they ""do what they want to do"" without thinking about others on the vehicle."
business,"Foreign investors invested a record CA$53.2 billion into Candian securities in 2004, Statistics Canada says. This was almost double the CA$18.5 billion recorded in 2003 and just beat the previous record of CA$52.8 billion in 1993. Of the 53.2 billion, about 35 billion was put into stocks and 20 billion into various bonds. ""For the year as a whole, foreign investors picked up $20.2 billion in Canadian bonds; a substantial increase over the $7.0 billion purchased in 2003 but just half the high of 2001,"" the agency said. Roughly half of the purchases were directly influenced by the acquisition of John Hancock Financial services in April which has created the largest North American insurer. Canadians themselves were also buying foreign securities in record amounts. ""Overall for 2004, Canadian investors purchased $16.2 billion in foreign securities. Of this, outlays of $15.1 billion were made in foreign bonds - almost double the amount from the year before and by far the largest ever yearly investment by Canadian investors in the foreign bond market,"""
business,"Egypt __NOTOC__ Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded Egypt's currency rating for the second time in four months based on the country's shorfall in foreign reserves and shaky political transition. It's the latest development for a nation facing mounting economic diffuclties. Egypt's foreign reserves fell by over 50 percent last year to about US$16 billion. Egypt has requested US$3.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund to bolster its reserves and prevent a devalation but that could take months. Experts say that Egypt's problem of attracting foreign investment and tourists, which are two sources that would increase reserves, has already caused the Egyptian pound to lose 1 percent of its value and if the country doesn't solve the shortfall in foriegn currency, it could even lead to a further currency devaluation within the next two to three months. The long-term solution is to restore tourism and foreign investments but both are suffering because of the continuing unrest. Egyptian tourism suffered this past year as a result of a revolution, a transition to an elected government, and continuing signs of unrest and instability. The Egyptian Revolution began on January 25 last year and President Hosni Mubarak resigned over two weeks later on February 11. The protests have continued as Egyptians grew uncomfortable with the military's control over the transition. At the start of this month, 79 people were killed at a soccer event in Port Said. Tourism in Egypt accounted for US$12.5 billion in 2010 but fell 30 percent, or US$8.8 billion, in 2011, according to Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour, Egypt's tourism minister. Tourism accounts for 11.6 percent of Egypt's GDP. Last week, two U.S. female tourists and their Egyptian guide were abducted in the Sinai peninsula by Bedouin tribesmen and released shortly afterward. The kidnapping took place in broad daylight on a busy road while the tourists travelled after a visit to St. Catherine's Monastery. Masked tribesmen stopped their bus, abducted the tourists by gunpoint, and escaped into the mountains. Three other tourists of unknown nationalities were left on the bus. Local authorities organized a search which ended in negotiations with local Bedouin tribesmen. The Bedouin demanded the release of recently apprehended tribesmen, who had been detained for drug trafficking and robbery. The US hostages were released unharmed, Abdel Nour said. As a location, Egypt boasts ancient pyramids, the Nile River, Biblical sites like Mount Sinai, museums, and Red Sea coastal resorts. Last year the number of tourists plunged from fifteen million people down to nine million, which is a 40 percent drop. The low amount of tourism to Egypt has also affected tourism in other countries. Stas Misezhnikov, Israeli tourism minister, said that Israeli tourism is down because the flow of tourism from Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort is ""almost nonexistent right now."" Egypt's current investment climate is also severely hampered by the perception that the climate is not yet right for investment. Mulyani Indrawati, managing director of the World Bank, said investors were not ready to get back into the markets of the Arab Spring countries until stability is restored but the situation has also been exacerbated by the precarious state of the regional and international economy. Egypt's domestic politics is threatening one of the country's largest stable sources of foreign investment. The United States' annual military aid to Egypt accounts for US$1.5 billion. U.S. politicians have threatened to withhold that aid package, however, because of an investigation into pro-democracy NGOs that involve 19 American citizens and more U.S. money. Senator John Kerry said the Egyptian investigation is a ""dangerous game that risks damaging both Egypt's democratic prospects and the U.S.-Egyptian bilateral relationship."" Faiza Abou el-Naga, who is the Egyptian minister who distributes Egypt's aid money, a former Mubarak loyalist who survived through the transition, and one of Egypt's most visible female politicians, claims the NGOs are meddling in her country's sovereignty. Both the Muslim parties who won the election and the generals in power are backing those hearings. Her argument that foreigners are meddling in Egypt also has a populist appeal. The military government's slow transition is also stalling foreign investments. Khaled bin Mohamed al-Attiya, foreign minister of Qatar, said a few weeks ago his government is holding back from making US$10 billion in investments because power has not been transferred to an elected government. The other Middle Eastern countries that pledged investments, such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are also waiting. The Egyptian government announced this week that it was investigating Yasser el-Mallawany, an investment banker with EFG Hermes based in Cairo, for allegedly paying soccer fans to riot at Port Said, a charge which el-Mallawany dismissed and attributed to gossip. Meanwhile, investors within Egypt are looking for other investment vehicles such as real estate as they fear holding cash in a period of devaluation. Florence Eid, who is an expert on Middle Eastern economies at U.K. Arabia Monitor, said the situation throughout the Middle East could get worse. ""People are frustrated because the reasons that they revolted against to begin with, are still there,"" Eid said. ""Whoever said this was going to be smooth was naive."""
business,"Economy and businessToyota announced on Friday that it will recall around 17,000 Lexus vehicles in response to risks of the fuel tank in the cars leaking after a collision. The Lexus HS 250h model was subjected to the recall following a US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation. Despite previously passing Toyota safety inspections, the conclusions of an NHTSA sub-contracted investigator were that; when the vehicles in question collided with an object at more than fifty-miles-per hour, more than 142 grams of fuel, the maximum allowed by US law, leaked from the crashed car. According to Toyota, further tests did not show any additional failure of the fuel tank. In response to the findings, Toyota issued a recall of all affected vehicles, since the company had no solution immediately available. The recall includes 13,000 cars already sold, as well as another 4,000 still at dealerships. Toyota says it plans to conduct further tests to determine the cause of the leak. A Toyota spokesman, Brian Lyons, said that the company was ""still working to determine what the root cause of the condition is."" It's still unclear when exactly the recall will take place, or when dealerships will be allowed to sell this model again. Lyons said that Toyota is ""working feverishly to get this resolved as soon as possible."" Toyota isn't aware of any accidents stemming from the leaking fuel tank in the affected vehicles, first introduced in the summer of 2009."
business,"Egypt Across Egypt hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets for the day, marking exactly one year since the outbreak of protests leading to 83-year-old longstanding ruler Hosni Mubarak's downfall. The country's decades-long emergency rule was partially lifted this week; meanwhile, a possible economic meltdown looms and a newly-elected parliament held their first meeting on Monday. Despite the new parliament, military rule introduced following Mubarak's fall last spring remains. Echoing the demands from a year ago, some protesters are demanding the military relinquish power; there are doubts an elected civilian leader will be permitted to replace the army. The brief unity against Mubarak has since fragmented, with Secularists and Islamists marking the revolution's anniversary splitting to opposing sides of Cairo's famed Tahrir Square and chanting at each other. Initial demonstrations last year were mainly from young secularists; now, Islamic parties hold most of the new parliament's seats &amp;mdash; the country's first democratic one in six decades. Salafis hold 25% of the seats and 47% are held by the Muslim Brotherhood, which brought supporters to Cairo for the anniversary. Tahrir Square alone contained tens of thousands of people, some witnesses putting the crowd at 150,000 strong. It's the largest number on the streets since the revolution. Military rulers planned celebrations including pyrotechnics, commemorative coins, and air displays. The Supreme Council of Armed Forces took power after last year's February 11 resignation of Mubarak. Alaa al-Aswani, a pro-democracy activist writing in al-Masry al-Youm, said: ""We must take to the streets on Wednesday, not to celebrate a revolution which has not achieved its goals, but to demonstrate peacefully our determination to achieve the objectives of the revolution,"" &amp;mdash; to ""live in dignity, bring about justice, try the killers of the martyrs and achieve a minimum social justice"" Alexandria in the north and the eastern port city of Suez also saw large gatherings. It was bitter fighting in Suez led to the first of the revolution's 850 casualties in ousting Mubarak. ""We didn't come out to celebrate. We came out to protest against the military council and to tell it to leave power immediately and hand over power to civilians,"" said protestor Mohamed Ismail. ""Martyrs, sleep and rest. We will complete the struggle,"" chanted crowds in Alexandria, a reference to the 850 'martyrs of the revolution'. No convictions are in yet although Mubarak is on trial. Photos of the dead were displayed in Tahrir Square. Young Tahrir chanters went with ""Down with military rule"" and ""Revolution until victory, revolution in all of Egypt's streets"". If the protestors demanding the military leave power get their way, the Islamists celebrating election victory face a variety of challenges. For now, Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi &amp;mdash; whose career featured twenty years as defence minister under Mubarak &amp;mdash; rules the nation and promises to cede power following presidential elections this year. The economy is troubled and unemployment is up since Mubarak left. With tourism and foreign investment greatly lower than usual, budget and payment deficits are up &amp;mdash; with the Central Bank eating into its reserves in a bid to keep the Egyptian pound from losing too much value. Last week the nation sought US$3.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF insists upon funding also being secured from other donors, and strong support from Egypt's leaders. IMF estimates say the money could be handed over in a few months &amp;mdash; whereas Egypt wanted it in a matter of weeks. The country has managed to bolster trade with the United States and Jordan. Amr Abul Ata, Egyptian ambassador to the fellow Middle-East state, told The Jordan Times in an interview for the anniversary that trade between the nations increased in 2011, and he expects another increase this year. This despite insurgent attacks reducing Egyptian gas production &amp;mdash; alongside electricity the main export to Jordan. Jordan exports foodstuffs to Egypt and has just signed a deal increasing the prices it pays for gas. 2011 trade between the countries was worth US$1 billion. The anniversary also saw a new trade deal with the US, signed by foreign trade and industry minister Mahmoud Eisa and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. President Barack Obama promises work to improve U.S. investment in, and trade with, nations changing political systems after the Arab Spring. Details remain to be agreed, but various proposals include US assistance for Egyptian small and medium enterprises. Both nations intend subjecting plans to ministerial scrutiny. The U.S. hailed ""several historic milestones in its transition to democracy"" within a matter of days of Egypt's revolution. This despite U.S.-Egypt ties being close during Mubarak's rule. US$1 billion in grants has been received already from Qatar and Saudi Arabia but army rulers refused to take loans from Gulf nations despite offers-in-principle coming from nations including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Foreign aid has trickled in; no money at all has been sent from G8 nations, despite the G8 Deauville Partnership earmarking US$20 billion for Arab Spring nations. A total of US$7 billion was promised from the Gulf. The United Kingdom pledged to split £110 million between Egypt and Arab Spring initiator Tunisia. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development says G8 money should start arriving in June, when the presidential election is scheduled. The African Development Bank approved US$1.5 billion in loans whilst Mubarak still held power but, despite discussions since last March, no further funding has been agreed. The IMF offered a cheap loan six months ago, but was turned away. Foreign investment last year fell from US$6 billion to $375 million. Rights, justice and public order remain contentious issues. Tantawi lifted the state of emergency on Tuesday, a day before the revolution's anniversary, but left it in place to deal with the exception of 'thuggery'. ""This is not a real cancellation of the state of emergency,"" said Islamist Wasat Party MP Essam Sultan. ""The proper law designates the ending of the state of emergency completely or enforcing it completely, nothing in between."" The same day, Amnesty International released a report on its efforts to establish basic human rights and end the death penalty in the country. Despite sending a ten-point manifesto to all 54 political parties, only the Egyptian Social Democratic Party (of the Egyptian Bloc liberals) and the left-wing Popular Socialist Alliance Party signed up. Measures included religious freedom, help to the impoverished, and rights for women. Elections did see a handful of women win seats in the new parliament. The largest parliamentary group is the Freedom and Justice Party of the Muslim Brotherhood, who Amnesty say did not respond. Oral assurances on all but female rights and abolition of the death penalty were given by Al-Nour, the Salafist runners-up in the elections, but no written declaration or signature. ""We challenge the new parliament to use the opportunity of drafting the new constitution to guarantee all of these rights for all people in Egypt. The cornerstone must be non-discrimination and gender equality,"" said Amnesty, noting that the first seven points were less contentious amongst the twelve responding parties. There was general agreement for free speech, free assembly, fair trials, investigating Mubarak's 30-year rule for atrocities, and lifting the state of emergency. A more mixed response was given to ensuring no discrimination against LGBT individuals, whilst two parties claimed reports of Coptic Christian persecution are exaggerated. Mubarak himself is a prominent contender for the death penalty, currently on trial for the killings of protesters. The five-man prosecution team are also seeking death for six senior police officers and the chief of security in the same case. Corruption offences are also being tried, with Gamal Mubarak and Alaa Mubarak accused alongside their father Hosni. The prosecution case has been hampered by changes in witness testimony and there are complaints of Interior Ministry obstruction in producing evidence. Tantawi has testified in a closed hearing that Mubarak never ordered protesters shot. Do you believe Egypt's current military rulers will allow a peacful transition to civilian rule? Hisham Talaat Moustafa, an ex-MP and real estate billionaire, is another death penalty candidate. He, alongside Ahmed Sukkari, was initially sentenced to death for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim. A new trial was granted on procedural grounds and he is now serving a fifteen-year term for paying Sukkari US$2 million to slit 30-year-old's Tamim's throat in Dubai. Her assassin was caught when police followed him back to his hotel and found a shirt stained with her blood; he was in custody within two hours of the murder. The court of appeals is now set to hear another trial for both men after the convictions were once more ruled unsound. A military crackdown took place last November, the morning after a major protest, and sparking off days of violence. Egypt was wary of a repeat this week, with police and military massed near Tahrir Square whilst volunteers manned checkpoints into the square itself. The military has pardoned and released at least 2,000 prisoners jailed following military trials, prominently including a blogger imprisoned for defaming the army and deemed troublesome for supporting Israel. 26-year-old Maikel Nabil was given a three year sentence in April. He has been on hunger strike alleging abuse at the hands of his captors. He wants normalised relations with Israel. Thousands have now left Tora prison in Cairo."
business,"United Kingdom Lord Howard, the former United Kingdom (UK) Conservative Party leader, and Alistair Darling, the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, set out their opposing views regarding the UK's continuing membership of the European Union at the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual dinner on Wednesday. The dinner was held as the UK is expected to vote on the matter in next month's EU referendum. Lord Howard encouraged those in attendance to vote for the UK to leave the EU, while Mr Darling was speaking in favour of a vote to remain. Responding to the CBI calling for the UK to remain in the EU, Lord Howard referred to the organisation's previous calls to become a full member of the European Monetary System and the Euro, saying these calls had been wrong, and suggesting this reduces the credibility of the CBI's current stance. Lord Howard also said if the UK left the EU and didn't replace it with some trade deal, which he described as ""inconceivable"", then the UK's exports would face EU import tariffs of 2.4% on average. He compared this to the UK's net contribution to the EU's budget, which he said was ""equivalent to a seven per cent tariff."" Mr Darling reminded the audience of warnings from Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, and Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, that leaving the EU could lead to a recession in the UK. Mr Darling said this ""would be disastrous for working people's life chances and living standards"". The referendum is expected to take place on June 23."

'M/B Mae Jan', a wooden-hulled ferry, was carrying 102 passengers, after an eight-hour voyage from Calayan Island in the Luzon Strait for Appari when it capsized less than 300 meters (984 feet) from its destination, at 8:30 p.m. Its bamboo outrigger broke due to strong waves, as it reached the mouth of the Cagayan River ('Bannag' Rio Grande de Cagayan, 'Ilog ng Kagayan'), along Barangay Linao, about 50 meters from the shoreline of Pallog village. Divers from the combined teams of the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard helped in the rescue operations. 11 of the fatalities, including the vessel owner, Arellano, and her daughter were identified. The police said ""there was a possibility that the boat was overloaded,"" saying that ""there was also livestock on board."" Due to ""trauma,"" the ferry's captain refused to talk to police. Meanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) formed a Special Board of Marine Inquiry (SBMI) to investigate the sea tragedy. It ordered the ""immediate dispatch of SAR-003 and MCS-3005 vessels and the PCG Islander for aerial surveillance."" PCG noted the possible overloading of the vessel since the boat's franchise authorized it to carry only 40 passengers and 10 crew members. In November, a cargo vessel sank in rough seas north of Cagayan, and passing vessels rescued 16 of 20 passengers. Weeks earlier, separate storms sank two passenger vessels in the central Philippines, drowning more than 50 people. Prior to the ferry sinking, the Philippine weather bureau had issued Gale warnings to coastal towns, of approaching tropical storm ""Ulysses"" (international codename: Dolphin) from the Pacific with winds of up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour, centered off southeastern Catanduanes, eastern Philippines."

business,"Global stock markets fell today, in a mass sell-off stemming from the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded late in the day after falling more than 250 points, ending the day down about 31 points. The UK's FTSE-100 index fell 232.90 points to 6038.30, and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 406.51 points to 16764.09. Central banks across the world are injecting funds into their banking systems to add liquidity, fearing that many financial firms with subprime ties will be insolvent. Yesterday, the U.S. Federal Reserve transferred US$24 billion to temporary reserves, following the European Central Bank, which authorized a record €83.6 billion addition to its banks, its biggest cash infusion ever. On Friday, the Fed entered into a $38 billion repurchase agreement of mortgage-backed securities, easing stockholder worries. Also on Friday, the Bank of Japan injected ¥1 trillion into Japan's financial system. The Federal Reserve met this week, but decided to maintain its target rate of 5.25%, although on Friday the federal funds rate was hovering around 6%, indicating a drop in liquidity. The volatile week began last Friday with Bear Stearns tumbling as a result from its complete loss of two major hedge funds worth more than $1.5 billion. The hedge funds had been dangerously exposed to the massive sub-prime mortgage failure, and the company announced it was unable to return any money to investors. Washington Mutual, and Countrywide Financial, both very large U.S. home loan lenders, saw shares fall. Countrywide Financial made a statement this week, saying they will be forced to retain a greater proportion of mortgage. American Home Mortgage Investment Corp, another large lender, recently filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. housing market has been declining for more than two years after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 17 times. Now, lenders are in a quagmire from millions of people who are unable to repay loans after taking adjustable rate mortgages, teaser rates, interest-only mortgages, or piggyback rates. Jim Cramer, of CNBC's Mad Money, remarked that as many as seven million people will lose their homes from bad mortgages. Last Friday, Cramer went on a tirade on CNBC's Street Signs, saying that the ""Fed was asleep"" and called for them to lower rates immediately. Asian and European markets have become increasingly entangled in the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. Deutsche Bank of Germany lost almost $3.5 billion in share value, forcing the government to organize a bail-out.

The Nasdaq fell 82.65 points or 3.44%, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 3.24% or 37.75 points. According to some reports, the quick loss happened because a trader mistyped an order to sell a large amount of stock, causing the stock price to go down enough to trigger orders to sell elsewhere in the market. (By the following day this theory had been abandoned.) Other reports suggested that the biggest markets ""slowed"" their executions when it became clear that computerized errors were occurring; as a result, the vast majority of buy orders were briefly withdrawn, allowing the free-fall to continue for several minutes. 4=Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Jennifer CheluneStock for the Procter &amp; Gamble company fell almost 37% during the sell-off, about 75 minutes to the closing bell.

We know that that was an electronic trade ... and we're looking into it with Nasdaq and the other major electronic exchanges."" The Reuters news agency reports that, at their height, the losses cause equity values to lose $1 trillion.

The proposal, which includes increases in taxes, as well as salary and pension cuts, passed with 172 members of parliament supporting, 121 opposing, and several abstaining; the proposal needed at least 151 votes to pass. There are 300 total parliament seats. The vote comes after a debate that took the entire day. Meanwhile, rallies and strikes are being held around the country to protest against the measures; the protests have occasionally turned violent, with a firebomb attack on a bank killing three people yesterday. The Eurozone and the International Monetary Fund had asked for austerity plans to be implemented so that Greece can access a rescue loan package worth US$146 billion in order not to default on debts. The austerity programme is estimated to save $38 billion. Greece also aims to lower the public deficit to less than 3% of the GDP in four years; at the moment it is at 13.6%. Prime minister George Papandreou described the situation to parliament ahead of the vote, saying: ""The situation today is simple - either we vote and implement the deal or we condemn the country to bankruptcy ... The future of Greece is at stake. The economy, democracy and social cohesion are being put to the test."" Papandreou also expelled three Social deputies from his parliamentary team when they abstained from voting; however, his bloc still has a parliament majority of 157 MPs. Finance minister George Papaconstantinou also commented that Greece will default on some of its $12 billion debt on May 19 if action is not taken, saying: ""The state's coffers don't have that money. And because the only way for the country to avoid bankruptcy and suspension of payments is to take the money from our European partners and the International Monetary Fund."" Opposition parties, however, say the measures will put too heavy a burden on the populace; the leader of the conservatives, Antonis Samaras, commented: ""The dose of the medicine you are administering is in danger of killing the patient. You know that these measures have sparked a social explosion ... The citizens of this country have to believe there is a way out. Because whoever cuts pensions of €700 cannot convince anyone."" Do you agree with this move?"
business,"date=2008-10-27 Economy and business The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is preparing a series of loans to both Hungary and Ukraine as financial problems are hitting the two countries. Hungary has already received a €5 billion credit line from the European Central Bank (ECB). Ukraine is seeking a loan of up to US$14 billion. The credit line to Hungary will be used to cover banks’ shortage of euros. Hungary has a severe debt problem with them posting an account deficit of €5.3 billion or 4.9% of GDP this year. As a result of this, Hungary is unable to find suitable credit to store up its supply of euros. ""We are in close dialogue with the Hungarian authorities and the EU to discuss further responses to the current challenges, including possible technical and financial support by the IMF"", said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the IMF. ""I have informed the authorities that the IMF stands ready to assist their efforts. We will provide technical assistance as needed and, in the context of a supportive policy setting, are ready to undertake decisions on possible financial assistance, responding rapidly."" Ukraine's Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk met with an IMF team on Thursday. In a statement, Pynzenyk said ""the parties discussed a situation of influence the world financial crisis had on the economy of Ukraine."" It is not yet known how much the IMF is expected to lend to Ukraine but it is expected to be between $3 billion to $14 billion. It is also not known what type of conditions might be placed on the loan. In addition to financial uncertainty, Ukraine is suffering from political turmoil with the current President, Viktor Yushchenko, calling a snap parliamentary election for December. The Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has made moves to stop the election. Ukraine's yearly trade deficit has increased by almost $7 billion since last year. The credit line by the European Central Bank is the first time publicly that it has extended help to countries other than the 15 that make up the Eurozone. According to Reuters, Hungary might be able to start the process of joining the euro quicker then expected. Currently, Hungary is on track to join the euro in 2011 or 2012, but if sped up, it is possible it could join as early as 2010. This might protect Hungary from further financial problems."

The services offered by Hewlett-Packard will include: enabling the service, design and implementation, application development and management. Tim Treat said that adaptive infrastructure is one of the company's new things that are to come. Recently the company's clients have put in place enough hardware capacity and infrastructure with the goal of supporting peak or quarter-end processes. However, a big amount of that capacity is unused till peak times. This is why Hewlett-Packard looks forward to bring solutions that are to allow users pay for the things they really use.

business,"The Ford Motor Company, the second-largest car manufacturer in America, will cut 30,000 jobs and 14 plants as part of a restructuring plan to relieve Ford after a US$1.6 billion loss last year in North American sales. The plan, called ""Way Forward"", the brainchild of Ford's Chief Executive Officer, William Clay Ford Jr., is to end Ford's North American losses by 2008. To accomplish this 30,000 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford's North American workforce of 122,000 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford's production capacity in line with demand. By the end of this year, the Atlanta and St. Louis plants will be closed. Atlanta makes the Ford Taurus sedan, which is being phased out. The St. Louis plant is one of two plants that manufactures the Ford Explorer, whose sales had a 29% decline in 2005. It will also close its Wixom, Michigan plant, Batavia Transmission in Ohio the Windsor Casting plant in Ontario which was previously announced by Ford that it was to be closed after contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union. The plant in St. Thomas, Ontario plant will have one shift cut from it. The plant makes the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis cars. On this cut of the one shift, Whitey MacDonald, chairperson of Local 1520, Canadian Auto Workers union said ""There is a lot of anger here today, there is no doubt about it. Any time a plant goes to one shift, it puts them in limbo. This car has made the company millions of dollars over the years they have invested in other products and locations - we are entitled to some new investment given our track record."" Positive news for the plant is that Ford is still committed to invest $200 million into the plant to upgrade the appearance of the two cars manufactured there. On the contrary, according to Automotive analyst Dennis DesRosier believes that the factory is still ""likely"" to close. DesRoiser said, ""The St. Thomas plant is old, the product is old, it make sense it is on that list. This may be just a short-term reprieve, it may be look at permanent closure in two to three years."" Two more plants will close in 2008, another two in 2012. Two more plants to be closed are to be announced later this year. Also, Ford will fire 12% of its 53 executive officers. Due to the company's current contract with the United Auto Workers union, workers at the idled plants will still be receiving their pay and benefits until Ford negotiates a new contract with the union. However, the workers may not earn what they earn today because they will not be eligible for overtime. The UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Gerald Bantom called say the plan is ""extremely disappointing."" The UAW issued statement saying ""The impacted hourly and salaried workers find themselves facing uncertain futures because of senior management's failure to halt Ford's sliding market share.

business,"Science and technology Cyanogen Inc The developers of CyanogenMod, an open source free Android-based operating system for smartphones, announced yesterday their incorporation following a successful venture capital campaign which netted the open-source project a US$7 million nest egg, and plan to roll out a simple installation app on Google Play for their Android firmware. Android runs nearly 80% of new mobile devices; CyanogenMod operates on at least 7 or 8 million of those. CyanogenMod replaces the read-only-memory image in android devices which have been 'rooted' &amp;mdash;control acquired of the device's superuser account&amp;mdash; allowing continuing development for, and backporting abilities of new generations of the operating system to, older devices. Investor Mitch Lasky wrote on his blog ""We believe that CM is poised to become one of the largest mobile operating systems in the world."" Benchmark Capital and Redpoint Ventures are part of the capital providers to form Cyanogen Inc. ""The only limitation we have right now is with the number of engineers and designers we currently have. As we hire more people and build this company, we’ll be able to work on so many cool things"", said Koushik 'koush' Dutta, who took questions alongside Steve 'cyanogen' Kondik and team social media manager Abhisek ""ciwrl"" Devkota in a Reddit Ask Me Anything event shortly after making the announcement on the CyanogenMod blog. The team of 17, including Boost co-founder Kirt McMaster as CEO, are in Palo Alto, California and Seattle. Kondik says Cyanogen mod is named after him. ""I'm terrible with names, so I just slapped 'mod' onto the end of my handle and ran with it"", he explained in the incorporation announcement. An early question raised in the Reddit event concerned profit-making: ""Monetization isn't an immediate concern and our investors ... feel the same"", said Dutta, adding ""Creating disruption in a multibilion dollar market is enough to make any investor raise their eyebrow."" This means CyanogenMod would continue to be free. Follow questions asked if the company was planning to release their own model of android device. ""We certainly couldn't take on the monumental task of building/testing hardware right now. Hardware would be one of many potential very long term paths we could take"", said Dutta. The firm's first announced step is to improve the process of installing the software on owner's devices, which Kondik described as ""hideous"". A new installer app is planned to be released ""in the coming weeks"" on Google Play. The installer app will not require rooting the device, instead installing by simply clicking a button. A further step, broadly described without any details, is a project with an unnamed original equipment manufacturer (OEM). ""We have a least one OEM partnership in the works, there will be an announcement next week regarding our plans there"", said Kondik. The team mentioned OEM licensing several times during the Q&amp;A session on Reddit. In addition to these corporate steps, there were questions regarding the roadmap for development of the ROM, which already has improvements regarding privacy and security over the native android loader. With ""plenty of things in the product pipeline already"" Dutta lists additional security features, AirPlay mirroring, screen recording, and Voice+ as upcoming. The mood throughout the event was jovial, with humourous questions such as ""can you guys PLEASE release a CM build for my toaster? I'm not sure what model it is, but it's white and I got it at Savers."" Kondik promised ""Ship it to me and I'll duct tape a G1 running CM to it"". Dutta said his ""10 of your favorite lines of source code"" are ""The ones that worked when they shouldn't have."""

business,"SomaliaThe crew of a United States-flagged ship managed to retake the craft from four Somali pirates on Wednesday, but the boat's captain is reported to be held hostage in a lifeboat. According to the authorities, a US destroyer and six other vessels were dispatched to the scene. The ship involved in the incident was the 17,000-tonne Maersk Alabama, which was headed to Mombasa, Kenya. It was attacked by Somali pirates about five hundred kilometers from Somalia's coast, according to the CEO and president of Maersk, John Reinhart. Ken Quinn, the ship's second mate, said that the four pirates were in the vessel's lifeboat with the captain, having sunk their boat after seizing the Alabama. The ship's crew had taken one of the pirates hostage in an attempt to swap him for the captain, but the ploy failed. ""We had a pirate we took and kept him for 12 hours,"" Quinn said to CNN. ""We tied him up and he was our prisoner."" The crew returned the pirate, but the pirates did not release the captain. ""So now we're just trying to offer them whatever we can, food, but it's not working too good,"" Quinn said. The Maersk Alabama was carrying food aid to the Kenyan port of Mombassa when it was attacked by the pirates. Twenty US crew members were aboard. According to Quinn, the crew did not have any weapons, but pirates were armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles. The crew locked themselves in the steering gear compartment of the ship, and remained there for twelve hours. Quinn says that the pirates ""got frustrated because they couldn't find us."" Piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden is rife: this is the sixth ship to be seized by Somali pirates in the area in a week. The last time an American ship was attacked by African pirates was in 1804."
business,"labor Vestas Wind Systems, whose closing wind turbine blade manufacturing centre in Newport, Isle of Wight, England remains the site of a occupation now in its 11th day, has suddenly announced that the consultation period preceding the closure of the plant has been extended, and that the plant will remain open until mid-August. The announcement, which was reported not by Vestas but by the RMT, was described by RMT General Secretary Bob Crow as ""another significant milestone in the fight to save the factory and 625 skilled manufacturing jobs in green energy."" The plant had been due to close today. News of the delay comes hours after confused reports that Vestas was withholding redundancy payment for at least 525 of the workers whose jobs were lost. According to a report by the local newspaper the Isle of Wight County Press, cheques which employees had been expecting today did not arrive; instead, workers who contacted Vestas management were told they would not receive payment until an interview process had been completed, and that if they began new jobs before the interview process was over they would not receive their money. However, according to Ventnorblog, a local Isle of Wight blog which has been following the Vestas closure closely, the layoff process was being delayed because a majority of the Vestas employees were refusing to agree to the management's redundancy plan. The delay of the closure allows more time for the negotiation of potential solutions for the Newport plant to remain open. The Vestas occupiers and labour groups continue to favour nationalisation of the plant, with Socialist Party spokesman Nick Chaffey saying: The courageous stand of the Vestas occupation and the huge support that stands alongside it from Vestas workers and beyond has rocked management and the government. With the vital support of the RMT and wider support from the trade union movement including PCS, POA and FBU, the workers' demand for nationalisation is the only way to resolve this crisis. In addition to the Vestas occupiers' proposal that the factory be nationalised, Caroline Lucas, the MEP for South East England and a member of the Green Party, has proposed that Vestas employees should form a workers' co-operative with government aid in order to keep the plant running. The Tory-dominated Isle of Wight Council has unanimously endorsed a resolution saying that the plant should stay open, and has called for new investors to take the Vestas plant over, as was done at a smaller Vestas plant in Scotland recently. The news of the delay comes as workers at the plant accused Vestas management of harassing the families of the 24 remaining occupiers of the plant. Families of some occupiers were served with legal papers at their homes. One of the occupiers, Luke Paxton, left the factory on Thursday night in order to be re-united with his family; Paxton was checked for malnutrition and low blood sugar by paramedics but was not hospitalized, instead opting to go home. Paxton complained that Vestas management, while now providing hot food to the occupiers, were still under-feeding them; the RMT, which is providing legal aid to the Vestas workers, has accused Vestas management of violating the Human Rights Act by attempting to ""starve the workers at Vestas into submission"". Protesters in fancy dress were successful in sending food into the plant yesterday. Protesters dressed as a fantasy wizard and can-can dancers distracted police and company security guarding the fence which has been erected around the site while other protesters flung a bag of food and an electric kettle onto the balcony outside the office which has served as the occupiers' home base inside the factory. No arrests were made but the protesters were removed from the factory grounds. Requests for comment from Vestas management received no reply."
business,"On May 29, 2005, the final phase of reconstruction of the Stillwell Avenue Terminal on Coney Island will be completed, with the reopening of the BMT Sea Beach Line to regular N service. N service currently stops one station short of Coney Island, at Gravesend-86th Street, and last reached Coney Island under regular service on November 4, 2001, though various General Orders caused by other closures have resulted in N trains running all the way. The Sea Beach Line began in 1879 as the New York and Sea Beach Railway, a steam-powered railroad. It was bought by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company in 1897 and soon fitted with trolley wire, with connections to Manhattan via various elevated railways. Reconstruction into a four-track depressed line was finished in 1915, and subway trains running to Midtown Manhattan started using the line. The Sea Beach Line was the fastest of the four lines connecting Coney Island to Manhattan, especially when the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line (last used in 1968) were in use, as there were no express stations between the split from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and Coney Island. The N was both the first service to be cut back from Coney Island and the last to return, and was the only one not replaced by a shuttle bus during its closure. The BMT West End Line (W, later D) was never cut back from Coney Island, but the BMT Culver Line (F) and BMT Brighton Line (Q) were cut back from September 8, 2002 to May 22, 2004 (returning to service May 23)."
business,"European finance ministers at the G-20 meeting which opened Saturday, November 20th, are expected to discuss the current exchange rate of the euro vs. the dollar. The euro is currently trading high against the dollar, so that it takes around $1.34 (as of December 4, 2004) to buy one euro. This has the effect of making exports from Europe to the USA more expensive, increasing the likelihood that US consumers will buy from a non-EU country. The exchange rate is set by the currency markets, although it is heavily influenced by the current account status (ie. the balance of trade between countries). Some European leaders want the United States to take action to increase the value of its exchange rate. The US though is seen as not wanting to do this, for two reasons: # A low dollar relative the euro means that all exports from the US to Europe are cheaper for Europeans to buy, increasing the likelihood that Europeans will buy US items and thus helping the US economy # Many actions which governments have done in the past to bolster unnaturally their currency have been fought by the market, and the market won. The most famous example is George Soros' ""breaking of the Bank of England"" One side-issue that this discussion might evoke is that of the exchange rate between the dollar and the Chinese yuan, which is fixed by China. Studies of this exchange rate using the concept of purchasing power parity (ensuring that a dollar traded to Chinese yuan will still buy roughly the same amount in China) show that the Chinese yuan has been around 50% undervalued for the past two years. This makes things from China on average 50% cheaper for a US consumer than they should be. US officials have throughout 2004 repeatedly called for China to end this practice. Normally it would end itself, i.e. even with a fixed exchange rate this process could only go on for so long before the entire Chinese market becomes valued differently. But since the Chinese central bank has been constantly lending money to the United States government (via the purchasing of US treasury bonds), that effect is mitigated."
business,"On Thursday in a meeting at New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office, Maria Contreras-Sweet Group, billionaire Ron Burkle, and a number of other investors acquired assets of The Weinstein Company for reportedly about US$500 million. The Weinstein Company had financial difficulties and was nearly bankrupt after Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women last year, which impacted the business budget. At least two of The Weinstein Company board of directors &amp;mdash; consisting of Tarak Ben Ammar, Lance Maerov and Bob Weinstein &amp;mdash; participated in the meeting, according to The New York Times. Maria Contreras-Sweet Group was represented by Maria Contreras-Sweet and Ron Burkle. The New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman was also in the meeting. Maria Contreras-Sweet Group agreed to pay The Weinstein Company's debt, sized at US$225 million, reports indicated. The acquisition would save around 150 jobs held at the Weinstein Company. Maria Contreras-Sweet Group announced the deal, also confirmed by The Weinstein Company. The deal was expected to take about 40 days to be completed. The agreement required Maria Contreras-Sweet Group to protect the jobs of company employees, and establish a victim compensation fund which would compensate victims of Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct while not rewarding the ""bad actors"", as Schneiderman put it &amp;mdash; people who had contributed to the sexual misconduct. The victim compensation fund would allegedly be around US$90 million, according to reports. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company in early February of this year. He reportly indicated he might settle the lawsuit after the deal is finalized. Maria Contreras-Sweet Group said they would use the assets in creating a new movie studio with a majority-female leadership. The Weinstein Company said on Monday, three days before the deal announcement, it intended to file for bankruptcy as it could not find a buyer that would keep it afloat until the deal would be finalized.

Istithmar also announced plans for a refurbishment to recreate the QE2's original interior from her first year of service in 1969, and an on-board museum dedicated to the ship's history. Dubai World will take delivery of the ship from Cunard in November 2008. She is 963 feet (293 metres) long and weighs 70,000 tonnes. She has a combined passenger and crew capacity of 2,794. She is famous as Cunard's longest-serving flagship and for being launched by Queen Elizabeth II."
business,"explanation=LyondellBasell did not collapse. Although the United States units and an affiliate registered in Germany filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection, the rest of the group, including the Netherlands parent, is operating normally. Sources: Global chemical manufacturer LyondellBasell — the third-largest private chemical company in the world — has collapsed. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, as well as the Dutch equivalent. They had failed to meet a January 4 deadline on postponed debt payments, and talks with creditors failed. Headquartered in The Netherlands, LyondellBasell is owned by private equity tycoon Len Blavatnik, who had already refused the company a loan to help deal with debt resulting from a $12.7 billion merger between Basell International Holdings and Lyondell Chemical to create LyondellBasell Industries. The company had already appointed Kevin McShea from Alix Partners to restructure the firm. McShea was assigned speculatively prior to the bankruptcy filing. Access Industries, Blavatnik's company, refused to extend credit as part of a loan deal brokered in March, a decision Lyondell Chemicals Company, a subsidiary of LyondellBasell, stated they were unhappy with. LyondellBasell had postponed $280 million worth of interest payments, which Standard &amp; Poor said placed it in ""selective default"" with a ""rapidly weakening liquidity position"". S&amp;P also said that LyondellBasell have debts of $26 billion in a report on the company prior to the firm's collapse. LyondellBasell responded with a press release, issuing the following statement: ""Standard &amp; Poor's definition of 'selected default' related to our corporate credit rating should not be misinterpreted to suggest that LyondellBasell is currently in default of its bank agreements. As they stated in their press release, 'This is a default in our opinion according to our definitions and criteria.' LyondellBasell is not currently in default according to its agreements with its lenders."" The company met with high oil prices shortly after the expensive merger. This was followed by a general tail-off in demand caused by the ongoing financial crisis. Investors were continuing to bet before the collapse that the firm would restructure under bankruptcy protection, leaving lenders with big losses, potentially over 90% of their investments. The cost of credit protection for LyondellBasell bonds had soared. The creditors include Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, ABN Amro and UBS. On Thursday, an interim allowance was made by a judge for LyondellBasell to seek up to $2.167 billion of loans. There is also an emergency loan paid out of $100 million. As well as LyondellBasell, 79 affiliates have become insolvent. Citigroup has said the collapse will set them back $1.4 billion in unpaid debts."
business,"UK British Rail minister Claire Perry resigned on Thursday evening, after continuing problems with Southern Rail. Southern has an ongoing dispute with the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) about increasing driver-only services, without conductors or guards. The union objected, citing concerns about job losses and driver safety. London mayor Sadiq Khan said ""This utter mess is now an embarrassment to our city"" and that he was ""calling on the government to strip Southern of its franchise and take over the temporary responsibility of running these services."" Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin focused instead on the union, saying ""Most industrial disputes are about threats to employment or conditions so the RMT's attitude is absurd. There is no threat to safety, no threat to jobs, no threat to pay and yet they continue disrupting passengers' lives on a daily basis.""

business,"date=2009-06-192008-09 financial crisis On Friday, German automobile manufacturer Porsche reported that its August-April sales saw a drop of 28%, to 53,635 vehicles, after demand for luxury vehicles plunged as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis. The firm also reported the revenue in the first three quarters of its fiscal year, which was at 4.64 billion euros after having fallen 15%. The overall decrease in revenues was due, in large part, to the decrease in sales of the company's 911 model, which accounts for a significant portion of sales. The 911 unit sales were lower by 18% for the year. ""In the first nine months of the ongoing fiscal year, the Porsche subgroup could not avoid the downward trend that has overtaken the worldwide automobile industry,"" the automaker said. ""This is certainly no surprise, but the fact that there is no reference to earnings any more in the outlook could be seen as a negative sign,"" said an analyst for Sal. Oppenheim, Christian Breitsprecher, noting that the forecast ""remains very unspecific""."
business,"A bid topping $17.7 billion was jointly proffered by Time Warner Inc. and Comcast Corporation on Thursday to buy beleaguered Adelphia Communications Corporation in an industry consolidation move. Adelphia is the fifth largest cable service provider in the United States with nearly 5 million subscribers. The market-share grabbing bid trumps the previous Cablevision offer of $16.5 billion. The bid is under scrutiny by the presiding judge over the Adelphia’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and must also be approved by the company’s creditors owed in the range of $20 million. The acquisition race to gain dominance in the cable service provider market is driven by the high cost of installation and maintenance of cable lines. Fiber optic networks deliver traditional entertainment programming over a cable wire and is becoming increasingly popular for broadband internet content. The growing trust and recognition of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) suggests phone service subscribers will eventually migrate to cable voice communication as opposed to keeping with traditional copper land lines. Telephone company operators are scrambling to keep up. The largest percentage of the bid would be put up by Time Warner (TW), who could gain by getting subscribers from the valuable Los Angeles market currently owned by Comcast and Adelphia. TW can also simultaneously divest itself of a stake owned by Comcast in TW by making a tax-free swap using some of the newly garnered Adelphia subscribers. While the consolidation would likely get a look by the government with an eye towards a growing monopoly in the market, it would doubtfully be blocked considering the existence of competing technologies. Competition exists in the form of still numerous television by airwaves usage, satellite providers, radio content companies, and telecom providers. Adelphia suffered a corporate scandal in 1992 with similarities to the WorldCom fall. Members of the Rigas family, founders of the company, were alleged to have siphoned off millions of dollars and hidden $2.3 billion leading to the bankruptcy filing. John Rigas and son Timothy were convicted July of 2004 and await sentencing."

After conducting its standard emergency handling tests on the 2010 version of the Lexus GX 460, Consumer Reports became concerned that the rear of the vehicle had a tendency to slide out, which in real life situations could lead to rollovers. However, the consumer organisation is also unaware of any such incidents with the 5000 GX 460s sold since its launch three months ago. Already embattled with ongoing safety issues with its vehicles, Toyota has been quick to act, though it did claim that the car was safe to drive and that it had passed internal safety standards.

The train runs from Auckland to Wellington, and is the only passenger train service that does. The North Island Main Trunk line has been used in New Zealand for passenger services for 97 years, beginning in 1909. Toll said it had been running the train service at a loss for many years now and was no longer viable to continue running the service. They also say that they approached the New Zealand Government for help so they could continue the Overlander but ""after working through with the Government both parties concluded there was not the passenger numbers to justify keeping it running. Significant investment would also have been required to replace the aging carriage fleet,"" David Jackson, Chief Executive of Toll New Zealand, said. Only 50,000 people used the train each year compared to the 200,000 people who use the Tranz Alpine in the South Island. It was cheaper and shorter to catch a plane, between NZ$100-$282 for an one-hour flight, compared to $158-$170 for a 12-hour journey. The New Zealand Green Party is disappointed by the news. Co-leader of Greens, Jeanette Fitzsimons, said ""I predict that as oil prices continue to rise further we will need The Overlander again."""
business,"Hideaki Noguchi, 38, a close aide to Livedoor president Takafumi Horie was found bleeding in a hotel bed with cuts to his wrists on Wednesday in Naha, the capital of the southern prefecture of Okinawa. He was later confirmed dead and the police suspect that he committed suicide. Hideo Sawada, the president of HS Securities, told reporters in Tokyo that Noguchi's family had identified the body. Noguchi was a board member at Japan M&amp;A Management Co., a unit of H.S. Securities Co. The firm was raided by prosecutors earlier this week in connection with fraudulent practices at Livedoor, according to the Kyodo News agency. He was a graduate of Tokyo's Meiji University, and joined Livedoor in 2000. He had previously worked at Kokusai Securities Co. as an adviser in financing. Livedoor was publicly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in April 2000. Noguchi then set up the investment unit Capitalista Co., which merged with HS Securities. News of the suicide is being featured in the Japanese media in connection with what is being termed the ""Livedoor Shock"". The problems at Livedoor have led to the loss of a third of its $6.3-billion value in the stock market. Livedoor maintains that its own investigation reveal that it did not violate any securities laws. Some view the affair as an outcome of the larger struggle between competing business cultures in Japan. Takafumi Horie is part of a new generation of Japanese entrepreneurs with little patience for the customs of a traditionally cautious business culture. Horie has shown an appetite for publicity through his internet blogs and appearances on TV shows while living a rock star lifestyle that includes private jets and actress girlfriends. Horie is also credited with popularizing stock trading among individual investors. The practice of day trading is relatively new in Japan. The Nikkei index was up about 40% last year, its best performance since 1986."
business,"Software giant Microsoft's chief lawyer Brad Smith claimed in an interview published in the magazine Fortune on Monday that open-source software products violate 235 of Microsoft's patents. The main transgressors are claimed to be Linux (107 patents) and OpenOffice.org (45), with e-mail programs infringing 15 patents. Microsoft wants royalties to compensate for the patent breaches. According to Microsoft's Vice-President of intellectual property and licensing, Horacio Gutierrez, the company wants to negotiate with the open-source companies rather than sue them. ""If we wanted to litigate we would have done that a long time ago. Litigation is not an effective way of going about solutions,"" Gutierrez said. According to him, Microsoft has over the last years tried to work towards a ""constructive"" solution to the alleged problem of patent violation. Microsoft in the past has used the strategy of cross-licensing to get royalties from companies who infringe their patents, for example in their deal with Novell. On a company blog, Novell reiterated that their deal ""is in no way an acknowledgment that Linux infringes upon any Microsoft intellectual property."" ""We don't think that customers will want to continue on without a solution to the problem,"" Gutierrez said about Microsoft's approach to guaranteeing companies that they won't get sued because they use the allegedly patent-infringing Linux operating system. The upcoming third version of the GPL licence, the licence under which Linux is released, will prohibit Linux distributors to agree to patent royalty deals. Microsoft called these ""attempts to tear down the bridge between proprietary and open-source software that Microsoft has worked to build with the industry and customers."" A related U.S. Supreme Court ruling from April 30th showed how software patents can be subject to court challenges; basically, if the innovations patented are ""obvious"", the patent is weakened. Joe Lindsay, information officer for a mortgage company, pointed out that the Unix code that Linux is based upon preceded Microsoft Windows, which might also be a reason for some patents to be invalid. Red Hat, the biggest Linux distributor, said in a statement on Monday: Red Hat IP Team Larry Augustin, former CEO of a company called VA Linux (now VA Software), responsible among other things for launching SourceForge.net, an open-source software development community, posted a message on his blog under the title ""It's Time for Microsoft to Put Up or Shut Up"": If Microsoft believes that Free and Open Source Software violates any of their patents, let them put those patents forward now, in the light of day, where we can all evaluate them on their merits. If not, then stop trying to bully customers into paying royalties to use Open Source. According to the Fortune report, more than half of the Fortune 500 companies are estimated to use Linux in their data centers."

business,"Mobile phone operating software maker Symbian is licensing the Microsoft ActiveSync technology in a move that surprised analysts. The license would allow Symbian to develop a plug-in for mobile phones to let users check email that is served by Microsoft Exchange Server mail system. Symbian was formed in 1998 by Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola and Psion in a collaborative desire to counter Microsoft's emerging market power in operating systems for handheld devices. While Microsoft now provides the Windows Mobile software for mobile phones, it has not attained significant market penetration. At the same time, in part through the increased popularity of Research in Motion's BlackBerry mobile email device, users have come to expect their mobile phones to synchronize email with various mail servers &amp;mdash; including Exchange Server. Symbian appears to be sensitive to the appearance of collaborating with the very competitor that spurred their creation. Symbian's press release emphasized that the licensing of the technology introduces just one of the many methods the Symbian software communicates with email servers. The spokesperson for the company, Peter Bancroft, was also on the defensive: ""Microsoft isn't a monolithic company"" he said, referring to the fact that Exchange Server and Windows Mobile are created by two different divisions of Microsoft. Shares of Research in Motion dropped on the news."
business,"Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney testified Thursday before an ethics committee in the Canadian House of Commons about the Airbus affair, a case involving alleged bribery at the highest levels of government to secure Airbus sales of aircraft to Air Canada. In his testimony, Mulroney said that he should not have associated with German businessman Karlheinz Schreiber nor should have he accepted bundles of cash — which he placed in safe deposit boxes in two different countries. Nonetheless, Mulroney denied accepting kickbacks. He admitted taking about CAD225,000 in cash from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994, which was after his departure from politics. He also said that the money involved promoting Schreiber's private business dealings. To the committee Muroney said: ""When I look back on it today, I realize I made a serious error of judgment in receiving a payment in cash for this assignment even though it was decidedly not illegal to do so. That mistake in judgment was mine alone. I apologize and I accept full responsibility for it. ... I should have declined the offer. I should have insisted that payment be in a more transparent or more accountable manner. By not doing so I inadvertently created an impression of impropriety on the high office I was privileged to hold."" ""Do you realize, Mr. Mulroney, that the way in which you acted in this matter did not make it appear that it were a legitimate transaction,"" said MP Serge Ménard of Bloc Québécois. Two days earlier, Schreiber testified before the same committee, alleging that Mulroney agreed to accept CAD300,000 to promote a light armored vehicle factory and benefited from the purchase of 34 Airbus aircraft by Air Canada. ""I never received a cent from anyone for services rendered to anyone in connection with the purchase by Air Canada from Airbus of 34 aircraft,"" Mulroney said, refuting Schreiber. Mulroney also attacked Schreiber's credibility, pointing out that the German could be extradited to his home country where he faces charges. ""He succeeded. He got what he wanted ... he’s sitting in his mansion over in Rockcliffe,"" Mulroney said. ""I think he seriously misled every member of this House ... with this false affidavit."" The committee's investigation will resume in late January, when it is expected to call dozens of witnesses."

business,"The Channel Tunnel, which runs between France and Britain, has resumed limited services after an earlier fire. Of the two tunnels, only the South tunnel has been reopened to the trains that run the route, the blaze having seriously damaged the North tunnel. The fire started on a freight train loaded with lorries. It burned for 16 hours and at its hottest was at 1,000°C. 27 lorries, six freight cars and a locomotive have been damaged. Significantly, the damage to the tunnel itself runs along a 700m stretch and exceeds the damage caused by an earlier fire last decade. The other fire required £200 million and a six month closure before the tunnel could be reopened. The incident required 32 people, mainly lorry drivers, to be evacuated from the train, which was heading to Calais. Fourteen were taken to hospital, some suffering from smoke inhalation. Several of those who escaped have said that they had expected to die. The fire's cause is unclear. The Guardian reports the fire started on board a vehicle carrying chemicals, but the BBC reports that the origin is unknown. Both sources confirm a lorry carrying carbolic acid was on board and French authorities say it is overturned near the seat of the fire, but it is unclear if this is the lorry the Guardian meant. Eurostar are operating some passenger trains through the tunnel, and limited freight services have also resumed, but long delays are expected. Car trains have not yet resumed. Do you feel Channel Tunnel safety is adequate? Conservative transport spokesman Timothy Kirkhope commented that he felt the fire was worrying, saying ""while thankfully nobody was killed in this incident, two significant fires in 11 years should act as a wake-up call."" However, operator Eurotunnel, who run regular evacuation drills, was pleased with the response by its staff.

business,"The United States Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has announced that inerting systems in airliner fuel tanks are to be made mandatory. The move, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), is in response to a recommendation made by the country's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into a 1996 air disaster. TWA Flight 800 was a Boeing 747 that exploded in mid-air twelve years ago today, on July 17, 1996, above the Atlantic Ocean. All 230 people on board the New York to Paris flight were killed as the aircraft disintegrated shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was ultimately determined that center wing fuel tank had exploded after sparking faulty wiring ignited a volatile fuel-air mix in the tank. After the investigation was completed the NTSB requested that the FAA enforce the requirement of inerting systems to prevent dangerous fuel-air mixes from being ignited. One of the most feasible ways of doing this is with nitrogen pumped into the tank, reducing the amount of oxygen available and making ignition difficult or impossible. The NTSB has a 'Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements' and inerting systems for airliners have been on the list since 2002. Since TWA 800 there have also been similar explosions in Thailand and India, but both occurred on the ground and resulted in no fatalities. The FAA's new directive requires all new aircraft from August 20 to have the equipment fitted. It also requires all carriers to retrofit their fleets, with half of their airliners to be compliant within six years and every jetliner in the US to have the technology fitted in nine years. The FAA's announcement was made at the Virginia hangar where the remains of Flight 800 are stored. Air carriers, who until now have fought against the changes, say that there will be a cost running into millions of dollars. If the nitrogen system is installed, the cost of retrofitting an airliner is at US$92,000 for mid-range jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, and costs $311,000 for a Boeing 777 or other similar long-range widebodied airliner. The 747, which has a large center wing fuel tank, is especially vulnerable to such explosions."
business,"New York Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned as the head of the International Monetary Fund after he was arrested and charged with sexually attacking a chambermaid at a hotel in New York. In a statement to the executive board of the IMF, he said he was resigning from his position ""with immediate effect"" to ""devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence."" Officials at the IMF said they would soon be releasing information about his successor. In the statement to the board, he said it was ""with infinite sadness"" that he had to resign, and paid tribute to the IMF. ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. The politician is currently being held at the notorious Rikers Island, where he has been put on suicide watch, after a judge at a court in Manhattan denied him bail for fears he was a flight risk after he reportedly tried to flee the country on a passenger jet. In court earlier this week, where Strauss-Kahn appeared tired, he denied the charges against him and offered $1,000,000 bail, but the judge refused. Prosecutors allege Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted a chambermaid at a luxury hotel near Times Square. ""The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted,"" a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said. Detectives said the politician was detained in the first class cabin of the Air France passenger plane which was minutes from leaving for Paris. Strauss-Kahn had reportedly fled the hotel ""in a hurry"" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. He was charged with committing a criminal sexual act, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. Investigators have this week continued to search the hotel room where the alleged attack took place, removing a piece of carpet in the suite which they hope will prove the allegation by the chambermaid that he forced her to have oral sex. Benjamin Brafman, the lawyer defending Strauss-Kahn, said forensic evidence found in the room at the Sofitel New York hotel ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter"". Strauss-Kahn is to make another court appearance to plead for bail again this morning, Brafman said; the defence is reportedly considering telling the judge he will surrender his passport, wear an electronic tag, and remain under strict living conditions. The IMF has said it will soon release information about Strauss-Kahn's successor; John Lipsky, the deputy head, has been acting as head since the arrest at the weekend. The incident comes at a critical time for the IMF as it tries to the financial states of struggling eurozone countries. Strauss-Kahn was meant to discuss the bailouts of Greece and Portugal with European Union financial officials at a meeting in Brussels earlier this week. Before his arrest he was expected to announce his candicacy in the race for the French presidency, and analysts suggested he posed a real threat to Nicolas Sarkozy, but the charges will likely put and end to the hopes of his supporters."

Facebook hired a public relations firm to systematically discredit Google by paying two journalists to plant negative pieces in U.S. newspapers, leaked correspondence discloses. The new revelations are likely to increase tension between the two companies, which are already fierce rivals. The social network has confirmed the validity of the leaked emails, seen by Wikinews, which suggest executives at the social networking giant hired Burson-Marsteller, a high profile PR and communications firm, to discredit Social Circle, a rival website run by Google. Burson-Marsteller then recruited two journalists &amp;mdash; Jim Goldman and John Mercurio &amp;mdash; to push editors at The Washington Post and USA Today to publish editorials criticising Social Circle over its privacy settings. The story was exposed after Burson-Marsteller approached a blogger to publish the propaganda, but the blogger posted the correspondence online. Burson-Marsteller has been forced to apologize for taking on Facebook as a client, admitting the orders to discredit Google violated company policy. ""The assignment on those terms should have been declined,"" a spokesperson said. The revelations are likely to be incredibly damaging for the firm, who have represented a number of controversial clients in the past. Facebook, however, said the allegations against Google were valid, insisting there were genuine privacy concerns with Social Circle. Google has declined to comment on the issue."
business,"An ambitious project to bring a unique tram-train service to Sheffield and Rotherham, in the United Kingdom, is back on track, following the announcement of a £150,000 Government grant on Thursday. The plans, which were originally to see tram-train operation on a trial basis over the Penistone line during 2010, have been on the cards since 2008, but were shelved during 2009 to allow alternative proposals to be drawn up. The current plans will now see the vehicles operating along a currently-freight-only line between Rotherham and Meadowhall, before linking up with the existing South Yorkshire Supertram network there and continuing onto the streets of Sheffield. The plans to use tram-trains &amp;mdash; which are already in widespread use throughout continental Europe, but not at all within the UK &amp;mdash; have come about as an alternative to an original proposal to extend the Supertram network to Rotherham, which would be a much larger expense for the same or even fewer benefits. Whilst the journey between Sheffield and Rotherham is already covered by mainline trains, project officials believe that the new service &amp;ndash; running via Meadowhall South and Rotherham Central and terminating at Parkgate, with a twenty-minute headway throughout &amp;ndash; will attract extra custom to the intermediate points between the two conurbations, as well as making travel easier for people who find it hard to walk to and from Sheffield's railway station; the tram-trains will serve the heart of the city-centre. Now that the funding for further feasibility work has been approved, Network Rail, Northern Rail and the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) can continue to look at the business and project case for the trial, which will look at a range of issues, including economic and environmental benefits of the tram-trains, and ensuring that the vehicles will be safe to run on both the Supertram network and heavy rail tracks. Transport Minister Norman Baker announced the sum, and stressed the Government’s commitment to the scheme: “There is no doubt about finance being available to deliver the scheme. The Government is committed to a trial of tram-trains in the UK and the route between Sheffield and Rotherham is the best place to develop it. This is a unique scheme. ""Tram-trains offer passengers travelling from rural and suburban areas into city centres a viable, environmentally sound alternative to short and medium car commuting that can cut congestion and reduce overcrowding at railway stations. “These sorts of rail fleets are already in use on the continent, but this is a first for the UK. The funding we are providing for this exciting project represents a real chance for us to test whether they can be adapted successfully for South Yorkshire and the rest of the UK."" David Brown, director of SYPTE, added: “We have done an awful lot of work on the plans so far and further efforts will look at ensuring the vehicles are compatible with both types of network, which are the same gauge.” If further investigations are successful, the system could be up and running by 2014."
business,"Swaziland The small African nation of Swaziland will receive a financial bailout from neighbouring South Africa. The South African government agreed to a loan of 2.4 billion rand ($350 million) after several organisations including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rejected King Mswati III's request for a bailout. King Mswati III released a statement about the bailout saying, ""We are thankful and also appreciate the assistance we have received from South Africa. This shows that they are good neighbours."" He added ""But it must be stressed that this is not a gift but a loan, which naturally should be repaid. This is why every Swazi must play his or her role by working hard wherever he is to ensure that the country gets back to its feet the soonest."" The King has been criticized for living with 13 wives in luxury while the majority of his country lives in poverty. Despite the South African government's agreement, the bailout has been met with some concern. The opposition in South Africa said that the government should reject the loan as Swaziland is an ""undemocratic state"". However, the government has said that the bailout would bring stability to the state and surrounding region. The loan is expected to help Swaziland, which is going through a financial crisis. The nation has reportedly been unable to pay some of its civil servants and could not afford antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV. Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Earlier this year, the country saw a wave of protests and demonstrations related to the economic situation."
business,"On Friday, a new generation solar powered cargo vessel, the Auriga Leader has docked in North America for the first time. Toyota Motor Corp will employ this car carrier for automobile shipments to Europe and North America from Japan. The vessel will be operated by the Japanese-based NYK Line. Auriga Leader has 328 solar panels to provide 40 kilowatts, about 10% of the ship's power while sitting idling in dock. This amount of energy is the equivalent to the power used by ten average homes. ""This is the first ship to direct the solar power into the ship's main electrical grid. It's helping all of the time, and its helping with everything, like the ship's thrusters and the hydraulics for the steering gear,"" said Brian Mason, national manager of marine logistics and export for Toyota. The panels are installed on the ship’s car-carrier, and then connected to the onboard 440 volt electrical network. Nippon Yusen K.K. and Nippon Oil Corp created the Auriga Leader's US$ 1.6 million innovative green technology solar power grid. The cargo ship has a length of 200 meters (656 ft) and gross tonnage of 60,000 GT, which is capable of carrying 6,400 automobiles. Richard Steinke, executive director of the Port of Long Beach said of the joint demonstration project, ""From our standpoint, it's another positive step,"" to reduce diesel emissions and the release of greenhouse gas."
business,"Microsoft has begun an attack against Google over the issue of copyright infringements. The officials from the software giant state that the number one search engine takes a cavalier approach to what concerns copyright protection. The associate general counsel of Microsoft, Mr. Thomas Rubin, prepared a remark that he delivered to the Association of American Publishers. He argued that Google's idea to create a book search engine might come at publishers' expense. Mr. Rubin criticized those companies that use the works of various publishers and not their own, stating that such companies make billions on the back of other people's content. He said that in distinction from Microsoft, Google feels comfortable making a certain content searchable online and afterwards asking permission from the author. According to the associate general counsel of Microsoft, Google does not always ask permission and uses the copyright work until its author tells the company to stop. In response to the accusations from Microsoft, the senior vice president for corporate development of Google said that Google performs legal actions. Whenever the company wanted to make certain content available online it always asked for permission. In such a way Google worked with several thousands publishing partners and recently made a partnership with BBC and N.B.A. to display videos on YouTube."
business,"After the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) completes its acquisition of Chicago-based electronic trading company, Archipelago Holdings within the next 12 months, the impact will also be felt in San Francisco, California as the future of the 123-year-old Pacific Exchange (PCX) becomes murky. This stems from a deal struck in January of this year, before the NYSE merger, when Archipelago struck a deal worth $83 million to take over operations of the San Francisco stock exchange and its 260 employees. All PCX operations are scheduled to be under Archipelago control by the end of September. Archipelago had planned to maintain the San Francisco operations. As details were released Thursday of the April NYSE-Archipelago merger to the Securities and Exchange Commission, all Archipelago functions are to be folded into NYSE operations, including the PCX stock and options trading business. The report did not state whether or not the San Francisco employees would be kept after the merger is complete. Started in 1882 at the San Francisco Stock Market, the Pacific Exchange, along with other regional stock exchanges, has suffered as customers shifted to electronic trading, which bypassed the need for stock exchange services in many instances."
business,"2008-09 financial crisis Stock indexes worldwide rose on Friday, after US bank chief Ben Bernanke said that the US economy was starting to recover from the recession. Addressing a conference in Wyoming, the bank chief said that ""the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good."" He added, however, that ""the economic recovery is likely to be relatively slow at first, with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 155.91 points, or 1.67%, to end the day at 9505.96. The Nasdaq reached 2020.90 points after gaining 1.59%. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, meanwhile, struck a ten-month high, reaching a level of 1,026.13 at the closing bell, up 1.9%. The British FTSE index rose about two percent, closing at 4,851. The French Cac index gained 3.1% and the German Dax 2.8%. ""Bernanke was a little bit more bullish than most people were expecting. He's saying that the global economy is starting to emerge from the recession and that the fears of a financial collapse have receded substantially,"" said Jacob Oubina, the currency strategist of Forex.com. ""I think the market is just taking those headlines as extreme positives for the outlook."" Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, warned that talk of a complete recovery might be premature. ""I am a little bit uneasy when I see that, because we have some green shoots here and there, we are already saying, 'well, after all, we are close to back to normal,' "" he said."
business,"Today, Romania introduces its new redenominated currency, the new leu (code: RON), which is valued at 10,000 old lei (code: ROL). The process, which is known as redenomination, started in March 2005 when Romania started dual-currency display and all prices had to be displayed in both the old leu and the new leu. Starting from today, the first notes and coins of the new leu will become legal tender, and the new leu will become the official currency of Romania. The redenomination (or conversion from the old to the new leu) is simple &amp;mdash; 10,000 old lei are replaced by 1 new leu. One US dollar will buy 2.98 new lei, while one euro will buy 3.6 new lei. After the similar redenomination by Turkey the old leu had been the world's least valued currency unit, with the US dollar buying 29,891 lei and the euro buying 36,050 lei (on 30 June 2005). With the introduction of the new leu, Romania's currency will be among the most highly-valued in the region. The new leu notes and coins, introduced into circulation today, will circulate alongside the old lei until 31 December 2006, when the dual-currency period ends and all of the old lei are expected to be withdrawn. However, old lei can be exchanged at banks indefinitely. The new notes come into denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 new lei. The largest note of the old leu was 1,000,000 lei, or 100 new lei. The largest note of the new leu is worth 500 new lei, or approximately US$167 and €139. New leu notes will also have the same dimensions as euro notes of similar value. Additionally, they will use the same colours and design as their corresponding old leu equivalent (for example, the 100 lei note will look similar to the 1,000,000 old lei note). All notes will be printed on polymer materials. Romania was the first country in Europe to introduce polymer notes, in 1999. The governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isărescu, said that the redenomination of the leu marks the symbolic end of Romania's economic transition from a planned economy under Communism, which was overthrown in 1989, to a free market economy. The reason for redenomination was mainly the fact that the leu had become severely devalued, especially in the 1990s, due to high inflation rates. From 2002 onwards, the leu stabilised, and has even appreciated against the euro and the US dollar in the past year. Hence, the new leu was introduced to simplify the national currency, and also as a symbol of Romania's increasing economic stability. It is also expected to help pave the way for the adoption of the euro by Romania, which is expected in 2012-2014, after Romania joins the European Union in 2007. Although the introduction of the new leu is viewed as beneficial on the whole, since it will bring Romania's currency more in line with the value of important global currencies such as the euro and the US dollar, concerns have been raised that the new leu will fuel inflation. Some people are concerned that the new leu will result in the rounding-up of prices, similar to what happened when the euro was introduced in the Eurozone in 2002, and therefore fuel inflation. However, a rise in prices is not thought to occur due to the dual-currency display. This ensures that all businesses continue to display prices in both the new leu and the old leu until the end of 2006, and hence they will not be able to raise prices as easily, for fear of becoming less competitive in the market."
business,"January's second Interview of the Month was with Danny O'Brien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on 23 January in IRC. The EFF is coming off a series of high-profile successes in their campaigns to educate the public, press, and policy makers regarding online rights in a digital world, and defending those rights in the legislature and the courtroom. Their settlement with Sony/BMG, the amazingly confused MGM v Grokster decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, and the disturbing cases surrounding Diebold have earned the advocacy organization considerable attention. When asked if the EFF would be interested in a live interview in IRC by Wikinews, the answer was a nearly immediate yes, but just a little after Ricardo Lobo. With two such interesting interview candidates agreeing so quickly, it was hard to say no to either so schedules were juggled to have both. By chance, the timing worked out to have the EFF interview the day before the U.S. Senate schedule hearings concerning the Broadcast flag rule of the FCC, a form of digital rights management which the recording and movie industries have been lobbying hard for - and the EFF has been lobbying hard to prevent. ; Wikinews I'd like to jump into some direct questions which were suggested by people on the research page. These first ones relate to the US government and online privacy. ;Since 9/11 the US administration has been progressively violating privacy standards in online communications, including circumventing its own surveillance laws and developing—and possibly implementing—the Total Information Awareness project. What is EFF's position regarding government monitoring of private communications such e-mail, instant messaging, and voice over IP? : Danny O'Brien Since the very beginning, the EFF has worked hard to keep the traditional laws regarding wiretapping and monitoring away from the Internet, not just because we believe in strong 4th Amendment rights but because technologically, a wiretap on an individual line is miles away from what is needed to do the equivalent on the Internet. That's why, for instance, we fought against CALEA being extended to the Net, and why we're fighting the FCC's extension of it now. : A lot of simple approaches to surveillance that the gov't would like to take are far from reasonable, to use the language of the 4th amendment. : I should say that I'm using American examples here, but we're obviously concerned more generally. ; Wikinews A related question - Will EFF be involved in cases, even as amicus, such as the cases filed by ACLU Detroit and the Center for Constitutional Rights New York, which allege the National Security Agency violated US law prohibiting wiretaps without a warrant? : Danny O'Brien We're currently looking into every possible avenue. One of the difficulties is trying to ascertain exactly what the government program involved. The EFF has a battery of lawyers, with different areas of interest. ; Wikinews Is this in the same vein as the recent requests for Google to pony up its search database? :Danny O'Brien No, that's a great question. The two issues are very different, but I think speak to the problems that the Internet is now being seen as a resource for government surveillance and research, which we think that all Net companies have to become aware of. There's a real danger in simply logging everything: you end up risking being a tool for the invasion of your own customer's privacy. ; Wikinews Google alone of the largest search engines refused the Justice Department's demands to turn over user data. The EFF is on record as criticizing Google's privacy policy. How does the EFF feel about that privacy policy now? What does EFF feel about the other search engine's behaviour—did they comply with their own privacy policies? Does this incident reflect the strength or weakness of corporate privacy policies online? : Danny O'Brien Privacy policies largely extend at the moment to merely the descriptions of what information is stored. We've long warned against companies collecting large amounts of data about their customers, and doing nothing to anonymise or aggregate it. We think that companies are storing up trouble for themselves this way. ; Wikinews Does the EFF have any material or programs that seek to educate employers and companies on the advantages of privacy? : Danny O'Brien We do -- hold on, I should be handing out more URLs http://www.eff.org/osp/ is our guide to ""online service providers"" for the best practices in logging data. I'm also speaking at the MySQL conference later this year on what *not* to include in your schema. It's an interesting area, because it's one where coders have a degree of power over what can be done. : Personally, I'd like to see a great deal more knowledge about how to aggregate and anonymise data being spread among the community. I'm constantly recommending the book Translucent Databases, which covers this very nicely. Also, the OSS source would do a great service by setting reasonable defaults for software logging behaviours. The trouble is, and I think we all fall into this trap; we assume the more logging the better. How many of us are casually logging this, for instance? ; Wikinews I'd like to talk about the Sony BMG case for a bit, if that's okay. First, congratulations to EFF in regard to some of the successes in the Sony BMG case. There are some questions, clarifications about the case, however. The settlement appears to cover the XCP and SunComm software delivered on CDs. What about OpenMG XCP, DRM used by Sony BMG's SonicStage software for Sony Connect? : Danny O'Brien Okay, this is where I have to say that I'm a *bit* limited in what I can say. Ah, if only out of blind ignorance in this particular case. ; Wikinews Do you know if the OpenMG XCP software is mentioned at all in the agreement? : Danny O'Brien I don't know about OpenMG: we joined the case representing XCP and SunComm users, so I don't think that was covered. But watch me shine the giant neon IANAL sign above me. If you like, I can ask after the interview, and we can add that to the results. ; Wikinews I'd appreciate that. ; Can you disclose the terms of the settlement regarding future use of software DRM measures? Have they promised not to alter users machines in the future? : Danny O'Brien Again, it's always dangerous to paraphrase legal documents. Ah, we have an FAQ that covers this. Thank goodness: http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/settlement_faq.php ; Wikinews This case also has some connection to copyright infringement: the XCP software included code taken from the VLC media player software, which is released under the GPL. Is EFF involved in any cases regarding this? : Danny O'Brien No we didn't cover this. We don't have standing to take on the copyright issue - i.e. we would have to represent a copyright holder. ; Wikinews Would EFF be involved in such a case if asked? : Danny O'Brien It'd be an interesting case, but we try to distribute these cases to where the expertise lies. During the Sony BMG case, we spoke to groups like the FSF and the Software Freedom Law Center. Generally speaking, they're the people who would be best placed to investigate cases like this. : It's worth saying that we're really pleased that there's now a whole constellation of great organisations that we work with. FSF, the Berkman Center, Public Knowledge in D.C., the list goes on. ; Wikinews The Sony BMG case is a content producer attempting to enforce DRM on their clients. The US FCC is trying to do the same thing on the hardware of US citizens with the Broadcast Flag. I know the EFF is involved in the lobbying on this, but I have questions which lead into this. This is a hardware issue. Does it matter on the internet? : Danny O'Brien Yes, for a number of reasons. : The point about the broadcast and audio flags is that they set up a kind of ghetto for content. The whole point of both is to *prevent* distribution onto the Internet. But in order to do that, you need to create a hardware world which is fenced off from not just the Net, but from user modification, and open source development. : This ghetto has to be created in every audio-visual device, by government mandate. So that affects the Net a couple of ways. Firstly, you essentially curtail the Net's use. But secondly, these flags are easily (though illegally) circumventable, so they generally prompt even more draconian laws (which are just as easily circumventable.) : One of our biggest problems with the flags is they cross a Rubicon. They create a government technological mandate in user tech. Once you start down that path—especially when you discover your initial mandate doesn't actually work—you just ask for more and more control. ; Wikinews Isn't this already the case, considering the HDTV standard and others? Isn't standards an element of the FCCs mandate? : Danny O'Brien Standards for broadcast and reception, but not standards for what you do *after* you receive something. Remember the FCC's primary job is to prevent interference, and to manage the commons of the public airwaves. It's a huge overreach for it to take over what you do with what comes from over those airwaves. ; Wikinews Because this is a rule, not a law, how does the EFF plan to approach it in the US Congress? : Danny O'Brien Well, the initial regulation was thrown out by the courts, who agreed with us that this was agency overreach. So what we've seen now is groups like the MPAA and RIAA attempt to extend the FCC's powers by law. : For all of last year, they attempted to do that by -- well, for want of a better word, sneakily attaching the necessary language to other bills. As you say, it can potentially be a very small amendment, so I suppose they felt that they could do this. Everyone fought an incredibly effective campaign to prevent this. And a lot of that had to do with the Net—we'd hear from the Hill of a lobbyist attempt to include the regulation, and we'd be able to organise calls and letters from constituents very quickly. : Most politicians, strangely enough, don't like it when something is sneaked past them. And we managed to alert a lot of them to arguments they weren't hearing from broadcasting lobbyists. : Now, we're seeing a second stage. Which is Hollywood coming out into the open, and presenting the flags openly. That stage begins tomorrow, with Senate hearings on the topic. ; Wikinews The Senate will begin hearings on this rule tomorrow. What does EFF expect to happen during this legislative process? How might this affect online communities? to get specific and personal, what does it mean to Wikinews readers and contributors? : Danny O'Brien If the law passes, it'll have dramatic effects. Particularly to Wikinews' future, actually: I think we can all foresee a time when Wikinews would take fair use samples of the news and public affairs, both audio and visual. With a broadcast or audio flag in place, that usage - while legal - would effectively disappear or at least be much much harder. : More generally, you'll see advancement in tech frozen in a lot of areas, the pulling away of open source development in anything that was connected to HD TV or digital radio. The biggest problem here is that technology like the flag gives the entertainment industry a stick to hit the technology industry. Before the broadcast flag was even introduced, Hollywood was lining up objections to technology like Tivo-To-Go. ; Wikinews I understand that would be the case in the USA, but could you explain how this might affect people in the EU? or anywhere outside the USA? : Danny O'Brien Sure, one of the areas that we spend a lot of time with these days—we have two staff working full time on international issues—is what's called policy laundering. So for instance, the worst provisions of the DMCA have generally been introduced into law in countries like Australia by their inclusion in bilateral Free Trade Agreements. Already, Hollywood representatives have been working in Europe and elsewhere to introduce the equivalent of the broadcast flag there. The rule is that if you can introduce it in one country, that makes it a lot easier to export it elsewhere. : Danny O'Brien Copyright extension is a great example of this. In that, the last US copyright extension was introduced to track Europe, and now Europe is being encouraged to match its copyright with the US. We're already seeing that with copy control mandates like the flag. ; Wikinews The Broadcast flag is a form of Digital Rights Management, in this case implemented by the US FCC. There are other DRM issues to talk about. In the French Parliament the DADVSI law, which relates to the implementation of the 2001 European Directive on Copyright in France, is under active consideration. Has the EFF had the opportunity to consider this law, and what is the opinion if so? : Danny O'Brien Actually, I was just talking to Submarine about this before the interview started. We're keeping as close an eye on this as we can. It's a good example of the ratchet problem as it's an implementation of the EUCD. ; Wikinews Canada and Belgium apply heavy taxes on copying medium, and the revenues from these taxes are used to support creative artists and developers, as an alternative to supporting DRM. What does EFF feel about such a method to control fair use/fair dealing? : Danny O'Brien Actually, we prefer a system of voluntary licensing schemes over either of these approaches. http://www.eff.org/share/collective_lic_wp.php ; Wikinews There are efforts under way to develop an open standard DRM, such as a project by Sun Microsystems which is relatively fair to users. Would EFF support an open standard/open source DRM, or is the entire concept of DRM considered unacceptable in any form? : Danny O'Brien Our take on Sun's DRM: http://www.eff.org/news/s/2005_08.php#003929 : Essentially, our disagreement isn't with DRm per se: it's DRM backed up by the DMCA's anti-circumvention laws. If users had the right to circumvent DRm to exercise their fair use rights, we think the market would quickly sort out what controls on media use were acceptable and what were not. ; Wikinews A follow-on question from the French one: does eff plan to set up some chapters in Europe ? : Danny O'Brien France like many countries, has a great core of activists and advocates already. We'd be delighted to help them in any way we can. ; Wikinews A follow-on question regarding the Sony BMG case: Does EFF have a response to the Register article http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/06/eff_needs_to_die/ : Danny O'Brien Sigh. I wondered if this would turn up. It's a really odd article, given that it includes a bunch of cases that aren't ours, ones that we didn't lose, and other oddities. I think we'd rather let the facts speak for themselves. Here's a list of our http://www.eff.org/legal/victories/ victories. There's a longer list at the wikipedia entry. ; Wikinews Are there any questions I should have asked you, which I did not? : Danny O'Brien Hahah! No, but I'm happy to take additional questions. I'm actually trying to think of some of the harder questions. ; Wikinews Well, I think I'll ask MrM to unmoderate now, and let everyone mob you. : MrMiscellanious :) Alright, here we go... MrMiscellanious made this room no longer moderated for normal users. : Danny O'Brien I guess the question we often get asked is ""Why aren't you doing something about X?"" where X is a matter that really is important—the simple answer to that is that we have limited resources. Which is why I'm really happy to see lots of other organisations spring up. ; Question Does EFF support TOR, financially or otherwise, anymore? : Danny O'Brien We host Tor's website, but direct funding was for last year. Actually, the Tor questions really are so frequentlyl asked that they're best answered on Tor's FAQ (including the legal FAQ we wrote for them.) http://tor.eff.org/faq.html.en ; Question en.Wikipedia prevents TOR endpoints from editing on the site; does EFF consider such class-blocking an acceptable response to behavior, or is it generally inappropriate? : Danny O'Brien We're disappointed. We hope there's a way of providing a technical solution that would work to support Tor's aims, and would be practical for Wikipedia. If we can work as an intermediary in that discussion, we'd be happy to. ; Question European organisations which have similar goals like the EFF were not successful in preventing Telecommunications data retention. What conclusions does the EFF draw for their own campaigns? : Danny O'Brien I have a long answer to that, with my EFF hat off. : Okay, so the reason I'll take my EFF hat off to answer your question, is because I'm also involved in ORG which is one of those organisations in Europe. The conclusion is that advocacy needs resources. One of the strengths of EFF and other US advocacy groups is they are permanent, with a paid staff. http://openrightsgroup.org : I think that now there are sites like http://www.pledgebank.com around, and facts like the Wikipedia funding drive show that we're getting to the point where we can turn volunteer organisations into groups that have that flexibility, plus financial resources. Which means you get to the situation where the group of volunteers who formed ORG can now work on projects like submitting to UK parliamentary inquiries: http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/APIG_DRM_Public_Inquiry : There are fantastic groups in Europe, like EDRI and FFII and I think the time is now right for those groups to be given more resources by everyone. And I speak as someone who traditionally comes out in hives when money is mentioned. It's a big leap, but I think it's one we all have to work at getting right. Give to them, at exactly the same time as you join the EFF: http://www.eff.org/support/ : Danny O'Brien puts EFF hat back on. ; Question ""Danny O'Brien ""once successfully lobbied a cockney London pub to join Richard M. Stallman in a spontaneous demonstration of Bulgarian folk dance."" Can you give details?"" : Danny O'Brien RMS is a great fan of folk-dancing, and was teaching me and some friends the dance moves to the Free Software Song in a pub in Shoreditch. Maybe it was the alcohol, all the allegedly viral nature of the GPL, but by the end, we had most of the pub doing them. He loves it, although recently I believe he's hurt his leg and can't do it so much any more ; Question Wikipedia was earlier attacked by a group, which has launched a website, claiming that Wikipedia should be upheld by law to have 100% factuality in their website (relating to an earlier case where a bogus biography was posted to Wikipedia). What is the EFF's stance on the issue? : Danny O'Brien I'm not sure of the site that you refer to, but obviously we'd support Wikipedia on this matter. We don't see any problem with Wikipedia's process. ; Question There is an article on de.wikipedia (German) about the hacker ""Tron"". His full offline name is included in the article. A German court has issued an injunction preventing the Wikipedia.de website (the website of the German Wikimedia Foundation) from linking to the de.wikipedia site, which is outside the jurisdiction of that court. What does EFF think about such extranational effects of local laws? Does a person's name, especially a figure as well known as Tron, deserve special privacy? The order was obtained based on a proposal by the deceased hacker's family. And it should be pointed out that the hacker's real name was known for a long time. : Danny O'Brien It's a good question: honestly, it depends on the law, and the practicality of the law. I can't speak to the case, particularly as the last I heard, the facts weren't clear. In this case, it's not the territoriality of the law that's of concern, it's whether anyone should be forbidden from linking to a resource."
business,"A New Jersey state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen Spanish citizens can sue over claims of health issues related to asbestos exposure while working aboard United States Navy and Coast Guard ships docked at United States-Spanish military installations. The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court that had heard the case earlier. The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim that they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County, New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships, when docked, are subject to the law of Spain, and so the case should be heard in Spanish courts. 4=Judge Anthony Parrillo The court's opinion, written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, explained the ruling: ""In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors."" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. 4=Mitchell S. Cohen, attorney for plaintiffs ""I find it difficult to understand how an appellate division court can countenance keeping the cases in New Jersey when there is absolutely no relation to New Jersey. There is barely any relationship to the United States of America. They've made their decision,"" said counsel for Owens-Illinois, John Garde, in a statement in The Star-Ledger. No decision has yet been made on whether the company will appeal the ruling. Mitchell S. Cohen, attorney for the Spanish workers, said that the Superior Court judge should have considered that the New Jersey court was the only location where the lawsuit could have been tried before dismissing the case. ""Spanish law will not allow, under the facts of these cases, to file a claim in Spain,"" said Cohen to the Associated Press. Cohen said that Spanish law states that a case cannot be filed in Spain because the alleged injuries occurred on U.S. territory. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: ""Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007."" According to the press release, the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008, the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. 4=Edward C. White, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. ""Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,"" said White. ""We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner."" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed typically have six months to a year to live."
business,"US stocks plunged along with other stock markets overseas as a greater than expected rise in consumer prices fueled investors' fears that the Federal Reserve's campaign of raising interest rates is not over. At the close of trading at 4:00 PM EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 214.28 points, or 1.88%, to 11,205.61. Technology stocks were not safe from the selling as well, as the NASDAQ fell 33.33 points, or 1.50%, to 2,195.80. The NASDAQ has now turned negative for 2006. Broader stock indices also finished much lower. The S&amp;P 500 fell 22 points (1.68%) to 1,270.32. This is the biggest point loss on the Dow in 3 years. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices to the consumer increased by a greater-than-expected 0.6% in April. Core CPI, which factors out volatile food and energy prices, swelled by a greater-than-expected 0.3%. Market breadth was extremely negative with advancers beating out decliners by a 5 to 1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy with 2.95 billion shares changing hands. Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrials, 29 of them closed down for the day. The only stock in positive territory was Hewlett-Packard, which closed up $1.05 (+3.38%) to $32.16/share after reporting quarterly earnings after the close Tuesday. The selloff comes on the heels of the Dow rising to within 80 points of its all-time closing high of 11,722.98 just last week. That rally was built on hopes that the Federal Reserve was close to ending its interest rate hike campaign. Since that time the Dow has experienced 3 double-digit point losses. Many market analysts and technicians, including Ken Tower from Schwab's CyberTrader, felt that the market was overbought and was due for a short-term correction. Today's inflation report suggests that the Fed might have to tighten interest rates further to combat inflation and slow economic growth to a more sustainable pace. Higher interest rates increase the cost of money, thus discouraging borrowing by businesses and individuals. European stock markets fell more sharply than those in the US. London's FTSE fell 2.92%, Frankfurt's DAX tumbled 3.4%, and Paris' CAC 40 fell 3.18%."
business,Canada632 Air Canada flight attendants will lose their jobs in November as the airline is eliminating flights and routes. 332 of the jobs will be lost due to the closure of flight attendant base offices in Halifax and Winnipeg. Another 300 jobs will be lost at Vancouver due to major reductions in Air Canada's Pacific-based international flights. Dramatic increases in fuel prices are widely blamed for the airline's cutbacks. The flight attendant layoffs are part of an overall plan to reduce 2000 jobs at Air Canada. Airline union CUPE learned of the flight attendant cutbacks from the airline on Wednesday. Representatives of the labour association gave critical responses to this news.
business,"New currency notes are being introduced in Ghana today. The new currency, to be called the Ghanaian cedi, replaces the previous cedi which has been in circulation since 17 February, 1967. The Ghanaian cedi will be exchanged at 10,000 old cedis to one new Ghanaian cedi. The exchange rate against the U.S. dollar starts at GH¢0.92 to one U.S. dollar. The new ISO code for the currency is GHS, and the new symbol, GH¢. The change, which was originally scheduled by the Bank of Ghana to start on July 1, 2007, will instead start on Tuesday July 3, as the original date is Ghana's Republic Day. Monday, July 2, was declared a public holiday as the actual Republic Day fell on a Sunday. July 3, is thus the first day that the currency will be available to the public as banks open to the general public. This is because ATMs were shut down over the weekend so that the currencies could be checked and replaced in all of them nationwide. The old and new currencies will be used concurrently until the end of December 2007, when the old currency will cease to be legal tender. This is the third Ghanaian cedi to be introduced in the country since 1965."
business,"Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the ninth President of Sri Lanka at a ceremony in the country's Parliament in Colombo on Thursday. Wickremesinghe, who has served as acting president in his predecessor's absence, defeated rival candidates for the presidency by 134 votes to 82, with support from MPs of the ruling Sri Lanka People's Front. The former president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, fled Sri Lanka for the Maldives on July 13 and tendered his resignation from Singapore the following day. This came after months of unrest and protests over a devastating economic crisis which saw soaring inflation, blackouts and shortages of many essential supplies. Wickremesinghe initially offered to resign alongside Rajapaksa; however following the president's exodus he assumed the role of acting president. Wickremesinghe served as prime minister under Rajapaksa, and the BBC reports many view his administration as complicit in mismanaging the economy. Nevertheless, the transition of power drew relatively few protests. ""He is here — and we will see what his actions are. If we don't get any food, any medicine, we'll be on the streets,"" a former protestor told the BBC. Ranil Wickremesinghe Anbarasan Ethirajan, writing for the BBC, reported other protesters' disappointment, worrying Wickremesinghe would gradually crack down and forcibly end the protests. For his part, Wickremesinghe said he supports peaceful demonstrations, but warned against occupying government buildings and attempts to overthrow the government. Wickremesinghe has held many senior positions during his 45-year political career, including serving six terms as prime minister. He unsuccessfully ran for President twice. Local media reports the next cabinet is expected to include ministers from opposition parties, who have agreed to work with Wickremesinghe. The new president will strive for stability ahead of resuming talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $3 billion bailout."

business,"Singapore The Singapore Navy on Thursday warned of a possible pirate threat to ships passing through the Strait of Malacca after receiving a correspondence from an unnamed terrorist organization. According to the Navy, the intent of the terrorists was to ""achieve widespread publicity and showcase that they remain a viable group."" While the threat received covered only oil tankers, other large cargo ships were also at risk of attack, naval officials went on to say. To reduce possible risks, the Navy urged ships to strengthen onboard security, including adding additional lights and lookouts. They also recommended that ships maintain a higher speed and report any unusual incidents to the proper authorities. The advisory said that past attacks in the Strait had been carried out by small vessels such as motorboats or fishing boats with armed crews. Commercial vessels were also warned to avoid known fishing areas accordingly. The Singapore Navy said that it had contacted other countries in the area to warn them of the threat. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have also announced plans to increase patrols in order to provide additional security. The Strait of Malacca is a major conduit for oil shipments. With around a third of global oil shipments passing through, it is the main route for travelling from the Middle East to Asia. Any attack on vessels within the Strait would likely have a major ripple effect on global trade."

It was scheduled to fly next year, but the mission has been delayed by testing and hardware problems. According to agency officials, the launch of the rover would be postponed until 2011. The delay could add US$400 million to the cost of the mission, which is likely to be higher than $2 billion. ""We will not lessen our standards for testing the mission's complex flight systems, so we are choosing the more responsible option of changing the launch date,"" said Dough McCuistion, the director NASA's Mars program.

The transaction should be completed in October. The purchase includes rights to the Saturn brand, its five current models and its dealership network. Two models would be discontinued, the Sky and Astra. GM would continue building the Aura sedan, the SUV's, Vue and Outlook for at least two more years. Saturn has 350 dealers across the United States. The dealers employ more than 13,000 jobs and sell only the Saturn autos. Canadian Saturn dealers are not included in the deal. According to Penske future Saturn vehicles will be fuel economy focused. An expert indicated that this would move Saturn back to its roots of a entry level car company. PAG is in talks with several international automakers to replace GM after 2011. Automotive News reports that Renault Samsung Motors of Korea is the most likely candidate. Penske wants Jill Lajdziak, Saturn's general manager, and Tom LaSorda, former Chrysler President to head up the company when it is independent of GM.

business,"British all-business class airline Silverjet has ceased operations and entered administration. The airline operated out of Luton Airport running services to New York and Dubai. Passengers booked with Silverjet have been told to claim refunds from their credit card issuer or travel agent. The UK Civil Aviation Authority estimates that 7,000 UK travellers could be affected by the collapse. The airline, which had hoped to secure an emergency US$5 million loan from Viceroy Holdings, was formed at the start of last year. It has now been put up for sale by administrator Begbies Traynor. It is thought that Middle Eastern company Viceroy may put in an offer, as might a group of former Silverjet managers who recently left the company. Included in the administration deal are Silverjet's subsidiaries Silverjet Aviation Limited, Skylease Limited and Sky People Limited, all of which are wholly owned by Silverjet. Silverjet shares are suspended from trading at the London Stock Exchange and it is feared that shareholders may receive nothing from their investments. Silverjet is the latest all-business class airline to collapse recently. US rivals Maxjet and Eos Airlines have both been forced out of business by high fuel costs, driven by the rapidly increasing price of crude oil.

The dual-engined Cessna 310, operated by Aero Star, lost contact with Air Traffic Control (ATC) eight miles (13km) off the coast near Ilheus, where it was intending to land in nine minutes time and was making a visual approach to Ilhéus Jorge Amado Airport. The flight had originated in Salvador and made last contact at 5:43 p.m. local time (2043 GMT) with Ilheus control tower. The four passengers have been identified as Sean Woodhall, Ricky Every, Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges. The planned development they had been considering is a luxury estate planned by Worldwide Destinations, who Sean Woodhall owns. It is based in Spain and constructs worldwide luxury property developments. Ricky Every works for Worldwide Destinations, and Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges are both directors of UK finance company Diamond Lifestyle Holdings, who had been considering a deal with Worldwide. At least three of the four did not live in the UK. The search for the aircraft is focusing on a location 20 miles (32km) North of Ilheus, where there are eyewitness reports that a light aircraft was flying extremely low and without lights, leading authorities to believe the aircraft loss power. Investigations are probing some reports of witnessing a plane crash, and there are unconfirmed rumours that wreckage has been found. Brazil's Coast Guard, three Aero Star helicopters and Bahia state police are all participating in the search. The weather was good at the time and the flight crew hadn't reported any issues to ATC."
business,"The new MacBook Air In a Wednesday media event, Apple Inc. released a new lineup of MacBook Air laptops and the 2011 version of the company's iLife software suite. The ""Back to the Mac"" event also included a preview of Apple's forthcoming Mac OS X Lion operating system, to be released in mid-2011. Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new products at the Cupertino, California event, saying the company has ""been inspired by the work it has done on the iPad, and it wants to bring it back to the Mac."" Apple has plans to import more features of its iOS mobile operating system to the Mac OS X operating system. Jobs announced today that the ""Lion"" release to OS X, which is scheduled for release next summer, will include more support for multitouch and a desktop version of the company's App Store. He said that the App Store will be available for Apple's current OS ""Snow Leopard"" within 90 days, and that applications can be submitted starting next month. Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime, Apple's IOS video calling application, would be available for OS X users immediately. Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion, dubbed ""Mission Control"" and ""Launchpad."" source= Steve Jobs In his keynote address Wednesday, Jobs announced the release of Apple's iLife '11 software suite, which includes the iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand programs. iPhoto has new slide show templates, while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities. GarageBand now includes several new piano- and guitar-playing lessons. iLife '11 was released on Wednesday as a US$49 upgrade, and is also available free with new Mac purchases. In another move to bring iOS functionality to Macintosh computers, Jobs announced an updated MacBook Air series of laptops, on sale now. The new MacBook Air uses flash memory rather than a traditional hard drive, and has no CD/DVD drive, an approach seen on the iPad tablet computer. In addition, the laptop's battery life has been extended, even though it is only 0.68 in (1.73 cm) thick and weighs less than 3 lbs (1.36 kg). ""We think it’s the future of notebooks,"" said Jobs. There are now two models of the MacBook Air: an 11.6-inch (29.46-cm) version and a 13.3-inch (33.78-cm) model. Analyst Shawn Wu says the company ""priced it really aggressively,"" referring to the computer's base price of US$999. Jobs said that his company sold 13.7 million Macs last year, totaling US$22 billion. In the last financial quarter, Mac sales increased 22 percent, comprising 24 percent of total revenue for Apple. However, the original MacBook Air did not fare so well. Sales and hype over the first Air decreased soon after its introduction, and the line was overshadowed by the release of Apple's 13-inch (33.02-cm) MacBook Pro. The MacBook Air had not been significantly updated since 2008."

business,"economy and business Morale is ""fine"" inside the Vestas plant in Newport, Isle of Wight, England, as an industrial occupation of the wind turbine factory finished entered its fourth night, says one of the occupiers. ""Mark,"" who prefers not to give his last name for fear of management reprisals, spoke to Wikinews and gave an update on the situation inside the plant, where 30 of the 525 workers whose jobs are slated to be lost at the end of July occupied management offices on Monday evening and issued a call for the British government to nationalise the plant. A double fence now rings the plant, surrounded by police in riot gear. Five people have been arrested for attempting to enter the plant grounds. According to Mark, while police are now letting food onto the plant grounds, Vestas' private security have been halting it at the gate; food for the occupiers is now being provided by Vestas management after the occupiers accused Vestas in the press of violating the Human Rights Act; commenting on the quality of the food, Mark said ""it's not been that good"". According to the BBC, the content has been mostly sausage rolls, pasties and crisps. The occupiers were informed yesterday that if they did not leave the plant by 10:30 p.m. on July 22, they would be fired. They have since been served with papers charging them with aggravated trespass and are seeking legal representation; the court papers give them until July 29 to vacate, but according to Mark, the occupiers have no plans to leave: ""we're going to be in here for a while"". Vestas has given no comment to the press about the occupation. Political parties in Britain have begun responding to the Vestas situation, with the Green Party adding its support to the occupation following the early declarations of support, previously reported here, by the Socialist Party and Socialist Workers Party. Green Party Leader Dr Caroline Lucas MEP gave her ""full support"", and said in an online statement, ""We should be seizing the opportunity to create a renewable energy revolution through a favourable policy environment and massive investment in the new technologies that can see us through a transition towards a more environmentally and economically stable economy. The Government can make a genuine start along this road by pledging financial aid to help keep the Isle of Wight's Vestas plant open for business"". The Greens held a demonstration in London supporting the Vestas workers on July 22. Environmentalist protesters have established a climate camp with dozens of people outside the perimeter of the fence and a mass demonstration is planned for Friday evening in Newport's St Thomas's Square. In parliament, meanwhile, five MPs of the ruling Labour Party have signed a motion protesting the Vestas plant's closure and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg stated, ""This closure exposes the hollow truth of Labour's climate change strategy"". Labour Party left-wing veteran Tony Benn is expected to appear with RMT general secretary Bob Crow and address a rally at the factory Thursday night. Opposition leader David Cameron of the Conservative Party has not yet commented on the Vestas situation, but Conservative MP Andrew Turner, who represents the Isle of Wight, held a confidential meeting with Vestas management, after which he said that nationalisation was ""not on the table"". Earlier in parliament, Turner said that he found Vestas's lack of negotiations with its employees ""totally unacceptable"". Late on Thursday, Ed Miliband, the Energy and Climate Change Minister, published an editorial in The Guardian, writing: We have to win a political argument that environmentally and industrially, onshore wind is part of the solution. In the meantime, there must be a strategy for the Isle of Wight to do all we can to help and there is. Not just support for the workers who are losing their jobs, but a strategy to work with Vestas. Milliband went on to promise £120 million in government investment in offshore wind power production and £60 million in marine manufacturing. Vestas attributes its pullout from the UK to difficulty in obtaining planning permission for wind farms. The Independent quotes a senior company executive as saying, ""We needed a stable long-term market and that was not there in the UK. We have made clear to the Government that we need a market. We do not need money."" Vestas's income is up 59% in the last quarter, although its stock has dropped 4.4% on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange since the occupation began. Meanwhile in the United States, Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cut the ribbon at the opening of a 300-turbine, 800-megawatt capacity wind farm built by Vestas in Holden, Massachusetts. Vestas is a finalist in a multi-million dollar government contract to build a new offshore wind farm to be constructed in Nantucket Sound by 2012."

The Airbuses, A330-200s, are earmarked to fly international routes to Seoul and Shanghai starting in July. All four have Internet and telephone access for passengers. The Boeings, B737-800 Next Generation aircraft, are due to be in service by the 2010. Also planned before the year's end is the increase in flights on the Jakarta-Kuala Lumpur route from one to two per week. ""We saw our current load factors have reached 75 percent and even more during school breaks like June and July,"" Said the company's Vice President for Network Oversight, Risnandi. ""This is very promising."" Garuda is now reported to be considering a bid for Linus, who stopped operating on April 27 and have recently been stripped of the rights to fly their former routes as legally required for airlines that do not operate for more than thrity days. Linus still holds some documents of worth to Garuda for transfer to their subisidiary Citilink. ""I heard that Garuda intends to buy Linus who already hold an aviation business license (SIUP) and an air operators certificate (AOC) for the scheduled air services,"" said Indonesian Director General of Civil aviation Herry Bakti S. Gumay to reporters for Bisnis Indonesia. He said that his office was in favour of a takeover by Garuda because foreign bids are limited to holding a maximum total of 49% of the shares in Linus. Linus Airways' President Directer Indra said that ""we are flexible to acquisition, depending on the investor. If someone wants to buy 100% of the shares we can release our shares, but if someone wants take only a majority shareholding with us as a partner – we are also open."" Indra commented that he has had an informal meeting with Garuda CEO Emirsyah Satar but says that they never discussed acquisition by Garuda and that Linus is already in talks with another 'strategic investor' with a view to resuming operations. Two airlines, Riau Airlines and Kartika Airlines, have both launched bids for the ten routes formally operated by Linus, which include four from Jakarta and three from Batam. Garuda Indonesia's Financial Direcotr Eddy Purwanto has anounced that US$650 million worth of loans from Bank Mandiri have been restructured. Garuda, who has apointed Rothschild's as their international financial advisors, will now pay US$450 million by 2015."
business,"A fierce storm on Sunday resulted in massive 18-foot waves, which split a Russian oil tanker in two and sank two Russian freighters nearby. The tanker spilled at least 560,000 gallons of fuel into a strait which leads to the Black Sea, and officials say it may take years to clean up. The tankers sank in the Strait of Kerch, which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the northeast. The two ships were carrying a total of around 7,150 tons of sulfur, according to Sergei Petrov, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations regional spokesperson. The tanker was carrying nearly 1.3 million gallons of fuel oil, and was stranded several miles from shore. Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said ""there is serious concern that the spill will continue"". Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term. Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings. Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port. Two fuel-loaded barges and Turkish freighter Ziya Kos also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov. Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. One of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing. The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe. Captains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24. The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during Soviet times, he said. Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Service office of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the sulfur spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a ""hazardous situation"", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia. Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution. Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea."

In a press release from Microsoft, Ballmer said, “Despite our best efforts, including raising our bid by roughly US$5 billion, Yahoo! has not moved toward accepting our offer. After careful consideration, we believe the economics demanded by Yahoo! do not make sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal”. Microsoft withdrew its bid effort after raising their bid from $44.6 billion to $47.5 billion, which works out at $33 per share. However, Yahoo! were waiting for a bid of around $53 billion, which was more than Microsoft were willing to pay. Microsoft had previously wanted to takeover Yahoo! in-order to compete with Google, the market leader in online advertising. The online advertising market was worth $40 billion in 2007 and will rise to an expected $80 billion in 2010. Some observers, however, are speculating that the bid withdrawal could just be another tactic in their attempt to acquire Yahoo!. Yahoo shares have dropped since the bid was pulled out."
business,"The introduction by Yahoo Inc. of its new Internet ad sales system was successful. The company's new feature may turn out to be very useful for Yahoo's shares, since investors are betting on rapid growth of the company's revenue. When Yahoo stated that it will launch on February 5 a full version of its new system, entitled Panama, the company's shares rose by 8 percent on Wednesday. The system, being introduced in the United States, will be launched a month earlier than Wall Street expected. The ad system is to bring the company in closer league with the number one search engine Google Inc. Yahoo's technology will permit various advertisers to pay for specific search terms, which are based on their popularity. Panama will also help advertisers in targeting ads that are sent to a specific audience on the Internet. The system will allow rotating ads in accordance with their effectiveness. Google have been offering these features for several years. Martin Pyykkonen, who is the analyst at Global Crown Capital, said that Yahoo was not as successful as Google but it still continues to strengthen its position as number 2. Although Google had a stronger software platform, Yahoo continues to register good results, which is worth something. Pyykkonen also mentioned that he is not forecasting any shifting in wholesales, and especially a sudden fall of Google, but he is sure that Yahoo will not be far behind Google; in fact the company is to shorten the gap between the two. The ability of Yahoo's new system, to draw more ad dollars from customers, should boost the company's growth in this year's second half. Yahoo is also dealing with a potential drop in prices regarding its key branded advertising sales. This is due to the competition provided by MySpace.com and YouTube."
business,"WikimediaMention The popularity of Websites that rely on user-generated content has increased dramatically in the United Kingdom, according to new statistics. MySpace and Piczo show the strongest growth in usage year-to-year, respectively up 467% to 5.2 million visitors and 393% to 4 million. Bebo is up 328% to 3.9 million, while Wikipedia saw a 181% increase. These sites draw more frequent visits that other non-user-generated sites in the UK Top 50, with 4.2 usage-days per month (compared to the 3.5 average). They tend to engage visitors for longer (80 minutes per visitor, compared to the 33-minute average over all), and visitors tend to view more pages per visit (217 pages per visitor, compared to 52-page average over all). Because users of these sites visit more frequently, stay longer, and view more content, the argument goes that this creates more opportunities for marketers to communicate messages. However, in reality, as the number of pages served becomes very large, it becomes more difficult to find sufficient advertising inventory to send with those pages. No-one yet seems to be making big margins from social networking sites. The cost of operating these sites, it turns out, is sensitive to scale. Moreover, users generate a lot of noise in promoting themselves, but there's little evidence that many of them are listening to each other — which severely restricts the site owners' ability to generate advertising services, and secure advertising revenues."

business,"Apple Mark Papermaster, formerly an Apple Inc. executive overseeing hardware engineering for the company's iPhone, is stepping down from his post. The move came after Apple received criticism last month for the placement of the antenna on their most recent iPhone model, iPhone 4. Apple confirmed that Papermaster, 49, had left the company, but did not say whether he decided to leave or was forced out. Papermaster did not comment on the situation. According to The New York Times, who first broke the news about Papermaster's departure, an anonymous individual ""with direct knowledge of the situation"" claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues, some related to the iPod Touch. When Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4, he praised the device's antenna design. However, many consumers reported that, when holding the phone in a certain location, reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls. Apple's response to the issue, dubbed ""Antennagate"" by the media, was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location. They later found a related software glitch that caused the signal strength to be misreported on the device. In a July 16 press conference, Jobs said that all iPhone 4 buyers would be eligible to receive a free case, or ""bumper,"" which alleviates the signal problem. Citing people familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal reported that Papermaster had been pushed out due to an incompatibility with Apple's corporate culture. The sources claimed that Papermaster was not used to the environment or corporate politics and did not possess the creativity the company wanted to see. They also said that it was Jobs, not Papermaster, who made the decision to proceed with iPhone 4 development even though the company had been aware of potential signal problems resulting from the antenna placement as early as a year ago. Papermaster's post will be filled by Bob Mansfield, Apple's senior vice president for Macintosh engineering. Mansfield was already involved in iPhone development, overseeing processor and display engineering. Papermaster had been with Apple since November 2008, but a United States federal judge barred him from working until April 2009. He had previously held a senior position with IBM, where he had worked for 25 years. IBM sued Papermaster in an attempt to block him from joining Apple, but a settlement was reached after he testified that no IBM corporate secrets had been disclosed to Apple."
business,"China In trading Wednesday, the Chinese stock markets plunged after the government tripled a tax on securities transactions.

The CSI 300 fell 6.8%, with over half of the listed companies falling the single day limit of 10%. The market has already doubled in value this year, after rising 130% in 2006.

business,"India The Indian aviation sector looks set to shrink amid financial turmoil, with the nation's air carriers in schemes to try and ride out the problems and domestic air traffic at a five year low. Air traffic has fallen by 19% in September, the fourth month in a row of negative growth. The news comes as a joint result of the current financial crisis and high jet fuel prices, with Indian airlines in debt to the tune of Rs1,800 crore after surpassing their credit limits with oil companies, who are themselves making losses due to government controls on the price of jet fuel. Kingfisher Red - originally known as Air Deccan, India's first budget carrier, until Kingfisher Airlines bought the company out - suffered the biggest drop in passenger numbers at 20% of their load factor. Flag carrier Air India is running at 53% of capacity after a 10% fall, and the average for airlines is now 55% as opposed to 65% this time last year. Kingfisher Airlines has decided to enter an alliance with Jet Airlines that will see them collectively control half the Indian aviation market. Both airlines are in debt over fuel payments with Jet owing Rs850 crore while Kingfisher refused to disclose the amount they needed to pay. The money is owed mainly to the Indian Oil Corporation, with the rest owed to the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and the Bharat Petroleum Corporation. 45% of costs for Indian carriers is fuel, which is 70% more expensive than abroad due to multiple taxes. Air India's head Raghu Menon expressed concern about what the Kingfisher-Jet alliance meant for his own airline. ""We were competing with both these airlines separately. Now we'll be competing with them perhaps as one entity. It'll be a challenge,"" he said. Kingfisher have cancelled an order for three A340 aircraft from European airframer Airbus. Airbus executive John Leahy said that Airbus had discussed the issue with Kingfisher before the choice was made and that this was the only cancellation from India. He also maintains that India will be an important area for Airbus, with the firm predicting Indian aviation growth will be at 9.7% compared to a global rate of 5.4%. Airbus predict that 1,000 new aircraft will increase the Indian fleet fivefold by 2026. Airbus have also welcomed the partnership between Jet and Kingfisher, saying it will help consolidate the carriers. Airlines are cutting capacity to reduce costs, with around 20% gone already. Average flight movements are down to 8,000 a week compared to 10,500 in the period from April to June. The aviation industry in India is expected to post a collective loss of US$2 billion. One executive at Boeing, Dinesh Keskar , predicted the downfall to be brief. “The current downturn in the sector is temporary and may not prolong for more than 6 to 9 months,” he said. Airlines, however, feel that the risk is very much immediate; Jet and Kingfisher are requesting a government bailout package worth Rs 40.7 billion. They are currently losing a combined US$1.3 billion."
business,"United Kingdom Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), today said the United Kingdom (UK) voting to leave the European Union (EU) would have negative consequences for the country's economy and the wider financial system. An IMF report released by Lagarde said voting to leave the EU would cause ""a protracted period of heightened uncertainty"", created by the UK needing to negotiate a withdrawal from the EU. Agreements with 60 other countries who currently have trade agreements with the EU would also need to be reached if the UK was to continue trading with them on the same terms. The IMF has also identified the UK's large current account deficit, the difference imports and exports, as a factor increasing the risks of a vote to leave. These comments follow similar ones made by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, who also warned that leaving the EU could lead to a fall in the value of the pound sterling. The Bank also estimated half of the currency's recent fall in value was caused by the uncertainty created by the referendum. Vote Leave and Leave.EU, campaigning to leave the EU, responded by pointing out shortcomings in the IMF's previous predictions, such as the effect of the Greek financial crisis. Former UK Chancellor Lord Lamont commented, ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde""."

Toyota has still not admitted any wrongdoing, and said that it disagreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which levied the fine against Toyota. In a statement, Toyota said it ""denies N.H.T.S.A.’s allegation that it violated the Safety Act or its implementing regulations. We believe we made a good faith effort to investigate this condition and develop an appropriate counter-measure."" Toyota is still at risk of lawsuits from those affected by cars that crashed due to a safety defect in the accelerator pedal. Numerous such lawsuits have been filed, and analysts said that the total cost of the lawsuits could be upwards of two billion dollars in 2010, and possibly as much as ten billion in total. While the government fine is largely symbolic, as the amount was limited by US law, it could provide support for lawyers who are filing legal charges against Toyota. If the cap on the fine was not in place, Toyota would have been fined a total of $13.8 billion; each of the 2.3 million defective vehicles sold would have had a $6,000 fine. Additionally, the NHTSA is reportedly considering a second fine, also of $16.4 million, based on evidence that there were two separate defects in the affected vehicles, and the company is facing an investigation from both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission."

Only €100 million of the EU aid will be given to Georgia this year. These loans are aimed to restore confidence in Georgia's economy and send a signal to international investors that Georgia's economy is sound. According to the IMF, international investors have been ""critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years.""

According to the filing, the retail chain owns US$6.6 billion in assets, but has a debt of US$7.9 billion. They were under a roughly US$5 billion debt since the company underwent a three-way acquisition in 2005. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital, and Vornado Realty Trust acquired Toys R Us for around US$7 to US$7.5 billion. After the US judge approved a loan, Toys R Us received about US$3 billion from the lenders to continue the business and survive a competitive market, and restructure their business model.

As a result, around 30 employees of Ziff Davis' Game Group, including EGM Magazine's staff, 1UP Network's web staff, podcast and video producers lost their jobs. A UGO spokesman explained that ""the reality is that UGO Entertainment is saving over 25 jobs, the company is retaining a core group of editorial all-star performers."" Ziff Davis Holdings Inc (ZFDH.PK), which publishes EGM and about 15 Web sites, obtained Manhattan, New York Court Judge Burton Lifland's approval of a reorganization plan under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. It was able, therefore, to emerge from its duly filed March bankruptcy protection petition. UGO Entertainment CEO J Moses left a note on EGM's gaming legacy, saying, ""since we started UGO 11 years ago, we have served the gamer community and built a world-class online publishing platform."" Ziff Davis Media CEO Jason Young further noted: ""We believe this is a smart transaction for Ziff Davis Media that places these market leading assets and teams in a great environment poised for further success. The transaction allows us to pay down debt and shift our full focus to our core PCMag Digital Network business. We thank our 1UP team members for their contributions and wish them the best of success into the future."" In July 2007, Hearst acquired the 11-year-old UGO Networks (Hearst Interactive) for an estimated price of $100 million. Established in 1998 by CEO J Moses, UGO is an online site targeting men aged 18 to 34. J Moses stated categorically that his company just saved 1UP and UGO never tried to acquire EGM. “Closing EGM has absolutely nothing to do with UGO. We have just hired 24 people and have expanded UGO by 33 percent, because our business is robust and growing. We only wanted to buy 1UP and related sites. That was our interest as a dot-com company and that’s all we’ve ever been for 11 years."" Sam Kennedy, editorial director of 1UP, further explained that Ziff Davis was insolvent and 1UP was not financially healthy. ""The reality of the market was that no company, including UGO, was willing to sustain 1UP as it was so the cuts were very painful but necessary to the survival of 1UP,"" he added. Electronic Gaming Monthly, which has been synonymous to video games for generations of gamers, was an American consumer video game magazine mainstay. It was published by Ziff Davis as part of the 1UP Network and released 12 issues a year (and an occasional extra ""13th"" issue for the Christmas season, also known as the ""Smarch"" issue, a reference to an episode of The Simpsons). As ZD's sole print magazine, EGM, a stalwart of the videogame industry and dubbed the New York Times of games journalism, has been losing money. The 20-year-old publication had 236 issues total, since its debut in 1989. In 2008, the company closed 27-year Games for Windows Magazine, or Computer Gaming World. In late 2006, Ziff-Davis also shuttered its Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, while its Xbox-focused XBN and Electronics Boutique in-store mag GMR were terminated in 2004. EGM's February issue, which is completed, will only be available digitally. Print publications have been suffering for years now, due to the global economic meltdown."
entertainment,"Two daughters of blues legend B.B. King are claiming on Monday that he was poisoned by business manager LaVerne Toney and personal assistant Myron Johnson. The allegations were made by daughters Karen Williams and Patty King in affidavits provided by their lawyer to the Associated Press. ""I believe my father was poisoned and that he was administered foreign substances,"" Williams and King said in identically worded sections of the affidavits. ""I believe my father was murdered."" Williams and King also allege that family members were prevented from visiting their father prior to his death. The lawyer for King's estate says the claims are ridiculous. ""I hope they have a factual basis that they can demonstrate for their defamatory and libelous allegations,"" lawyer Brent Bryson said in a statement to the Associated Press. Bryson says that King was appropriately cared for by medical professionals up until his death on May 14 in Las Vegas. An autopsy of B.B. King's body was carried out on Sunday by the Clark County, Nevada coroner's office. The coroner's office said on Twitter that it would be a minimum of six to eight weeks before results of the autopsy are finalised. The Las Vegas Police department said that a potential homicide investigation into the death of the blues legend will depend on autopsy findings."
entertainment,"Billy Werber, third baseman in Major League Baseball, has died at the age of 100. Werber died of natural causes on Thursday, January 22, 2009 at an assisted living center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was moved there after his health deteriorated a month ago. His son said that when admitted, Werber refused to eat solid foods and would only drink liquids. ""He just refused to eat and that was his plan,"" Bill Werber Jr. told the Associated Press. He added that his father was ""sharp up until four weeks ago"". Born William Murray Werber on June 20, 1908 in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, he played for the New York Yankees from (1930, 1933), the Boston Red Sox from (1933-1936), the Philadelphia Athletics from (1937-1938), Cincinnati Reds from (1939-1941) and the New York Giants from (1942). In 1934, Werber became the starting third baseman of the Red Sox. He responded with a career-high .321 batting average, including 200 hits; led the American League with 40 stolen bases, and posted double digits in doubles (41), triples (10) and home runs (11). He led the league in stolen bases in 1935 (29) and 1937 (35). Boston traded him to the Philadelphia Athletics for the 1937 season, and he joined the Cincinnati Reds in 1939. In an 11-season career, Werber was a .271 hitter with 78 home runs and 539 RBI in 1,295 games. One of the most aggressive baserunners of the 1930s, probably the most aggressive next to Ben Chapman, he stole 215 bases. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1961. His wife Kathryn 'Tat' Werber died in 2000, after she and Werber had been married 70 years. Bill Werber Jr. says that his father is to be cremated and services, which will be open to the public, will be held on the weekend of January 31 through February 1."
entertainment,"ITV Thursday marked the 50th anniversary of British soap opera Coronation Streets broadcast. The programme, which was created by Tony Warren and developed by Granada Television &amp;mdash; now branded on-air as ITV Studios &amp;mdash; in Manchester, England, was first broadcast on December 9, 1960 on ITV. The original commission was just 13 episodes. Nearly 7,500 episodes later, Coronation Street still broadcasts on ITV1. At least one episode of the programme was broadcast every night between December 6 and December 10; on Thursday, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with a live episode. The major storyline of the week, entitled ""Four Funerals and a Wedding"", started with a tram crash on Monday, shortly after a gas explosion in a new nearby bar called The Joinery damaged railway tracks. Phil Collinson At its peak, Thursday's one-hour live episode received ratings of approximately 14.9 million viewers &amp;mdash; the highest total for the show for over six years. Within the sixty scenes, the storylines included character Fiz Stape prematurely giving birth to a baby girl, who was given the name Hope. Peter Barlow lay on his hospital bed as he attempted to say his wedding vows to Leanne Battersby; he subsequently flatlined. Molly Dobbs admitted her affair with Kevin Webster to Sally Webster &amp;mdash; Kevin's wife &amp;mdash; before dying as a result of her injuries. There were virtually no mistakes made in the episode. Phil Collinson, the producer, expressed his approval for the episode. ""I'm so proud and gobsmacked at how brilliant it looked,"" he commented. ""It was like seeing it for the first time. I'm stunned and amazed."" Ken Barlow is the only remaining character from the first episode, always portrayed by William Roache. Coronation Street now has its own version of encyclopedia website Wikipedia called Corriepedia, which was launched on May 21, 2008. Because of this anniversary, numerous special programmes were also broadcast. The first ever episode of Coronation Street was repeated on Monday. On Wednesday-Thursday night Coronation Street: 50 Years, 50 Moments revealed the results of a poll to determine the fifty best Coronation Street moments. A humourous scene featuring character Blanche Hunt at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting topped the poll. Hunt, portrayed by the late Maggie Jones, was also revealed as the most popular character, according to a study by UK magazine Inside Soap. Second-place moment was a storyline involving serial killer Richard Hillman. Brian Capron, who portrayed Hillman, commented ""Funnily enough because it's all come back it seems to have done me a lot of good. It's kind of an iconic storyline that I was involved in. There were some wonderful blackly humourous lines and the gloves, that slight pantomime element. You could love to hate him. They gave me so many great lines."" Friday also saw the ITV1 broadcast of one-off game show, Coronation Street: The Big 50, a part-entertainment programme. Hosted by Paul O'Grady, it featured various members of the Coronation Street cast as contestants, split into three teams: ""Weatherfield Lads"", ""Pint Pullers"", and ""Rovers Regulars"" plus a fourth team of celebrity fans, or ""Superfans"". The ""Rovers Regulars"" were to become the victors."
entertainment,"RussiaDima Bilan has won the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, the 53rd, for Russia with his song Believe. The song was developed by US R&amp;B artist Timbaland. The song won the competition with 272 points; 42 points ahead of Ukraine's Ani Lorak in second place with 230 points for the song Shady Lady. Third was Kalomira for Greece with Secret Combination The voting for the competition came from 43 countries across Europe, but with 25 countries competing, the others having failed to get through the semi finals. Russia has never won the contest before, Bilan having come second in 2006, losing out to Finnish hard rock band Lordi with Hard Rock Halellujah. Furtherdown the scale Germany's No Angels with Disapear, Poland's Isis Gee with For Life and the United Kingdom's Andy Abraham with Even If came joint last with 14 points. Fourth last was Teräsbetoni, a Finnish heavy metal band performing in their native language with Missä Mihet Ratsastaa (Where Men Ride). Sweden's Charlotte Perrelli had been predicted to repeat her 1999 victory, this time with Hero, but also received a low score. There was an estimated 100 million television viewers from across Europe. UK commentator Terry Wogan has garnered significant media attention for criticising the contest live towards the end of the broadcast for being overly political. ""It's a disappointment, considering that Andy Abraham gave, I think, the performance of his life with a song that certainly deserved more marks than it got when you look at the points that Spain got, that Bosnia-Herzegovina got - some really ridiculous songs,"" he said. ""You have to say that this is no longer a music contest... I have to decide whether we (himself and his producer, who already announced he wanted to leave) want to do this again. Western European participants have to decide whether they want to take part from here on in, because their prospects are poor."" He called the contest ""political"". Spain was represented by Rodolfo Chikilicuatre with Baila el Chiki Chiki (Dance the Chiki Chiki) and Bosnia and Herzegovina by Elvir Laković Laka with Pokušaj (try). Bilan, who received the maximum 12 points from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus and Armenia, all of which are former Soviet countries, was sent a telegram from Putin to congratulate him after his victory. Mevedev also contacted him later by phone to congratulate him. ""Russia is the favorite now, it's just tearing everybody up — in basketball, football, hockey, and Eurovision!"" commented champion figure skater Evgeni Plushenko, who had joined Bilan onstage to skate as part of the winning performance. He is now also a politician. Next year's contest will be held in Russia."
entertainment,"Digital radio listeners in the UK may have noticed a new station on their list over the last few months with the beta launch of Amazing Radio, founded by Paul Campbell as a follow up and companion to Amazing Tunes. However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music. Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com. Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid. The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station. Amazing markets itself as an ""ethical"" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues. They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day. source=Paul Campbell Paul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4. After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005. As Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviewed Campbell to find out more. WikinewsHi Paul, thanks for doing this interview. Paul CampbellMy pleasure – thanks very much for asking me. We’re really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us. WNAt the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing. Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it. Has anything come of it? PCSure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules. It’s still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve. The details are a bit complex, but here goes. (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise). As British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV. According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum. Nice. source=Paul Campbell Not really. In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio &amp; TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC. These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers). The BBC does it for the best of reasons – to provide a public service – but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty you’ll get paid on the 15th of every month. It’s a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong. Here, the BBC’s actions have grave implications. And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But it’s kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop. So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy. Wise people noticed this. A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed. A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created. It tried to address the problem. It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one. Here, it hasn't. Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game. It’s launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury. There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff. I’ll bet they have BBC Introducing pens. It's everywhere. This is, by any reckoning, a ‘new service’. But it’s not been subjected to a public value test. Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label – i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing. This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself. Whether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules. It hasn’t. There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this. So we complained. It was a bit hilarious. The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint. There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic. I said ‘I’m guessing the BBC didn’t do a PVT because it didn’t think it needed to do a PVT. We think they should have done. We’re asking you to investigate, to see if you agree’. They said ‘you have to complain to them first. It’s protocol’. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite … ludicrously bureaucratic … and totally useless. So we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981. It takes time: I’ll have to write it myself, and I have a business to run. The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it … and reject it. (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position. They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience. Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity. Either way, they'll reject it). When they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say ‘guess what? The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?’. Yawn. source=Paul Campbell All this might make me seem a BBC-hater. Actually nothing could be further from the truth. The BBC trained me. I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer. Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK. I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income. (Or even, any income at all). The stakes are high. The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. There’s an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity. So we’ll do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun. (This would never happen in the States). WNYou don't accept any PRS registered artists at all. Why not? Do you agree with Paul? Are PRS getting it completely wrong? PCWe’d love to – after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent. But we can’t. There’s two reasons. :::1. PRS has a barmy standard contract for using their members’ music online. It requires us to pay them a fixed percentage of ALL revenue from that website – whether or not the revenue is derived from their members’ work. So if we had 100,000 songs from non-PRS artists on amazingtunes.com, and one song from a PRS artist, we’d have to pay them a percentage of the revenue from ALL 100,000 songs. I.e., we’d have to take money out of the pockets out of non-PRS artists to pay to PRS. That would be immoral. :::2. If we played PRS artists on the radio, we’d have to pay PRS for our use of their members’ music. Sound fair enough? But PRS doesn’t know what to do with the money. They’d put it into a big bucket, then share it out among ALL their artists - not the members whose songs we played, all their artists, including rich and famous signed ones. The vast majority of PRS payments go to a tiny minority of artists (and big record labels). So it would be another case of stealing from Peter to pay Paul. Paul McCartney, that is. I wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal. I said that I thought we had identical aims – to make life fair for musicians. I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry. But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand. WNAnd how would you suggest PRS could improve? If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them? PCPRS could improve by; :::a. buying some computers (so they could handle our comprehensive data about the tracks we play, and then pay the right people); :::b. accepting that we want to mix PRS and non-PRS artists, and only asking for a share of the artists they actually represent. If they did that, we’d sign up. This would not necessarily be popular with our audience. A lot of people – especially charities and small businesses – like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence. But we’d do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians. source=Paul Campbell My personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work. There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work. They actually did that. They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality. I think it’s incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; it’s ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; it’s causing thousands of people to stop listening to music. When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldn’t it? WNWith regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes? PCSorry, but we don’t currently release detailed figures – our competitors would love it, but we’d rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make ‘anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune’. At the moment, because it’s still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options. As things grow – and there’s been incredible growth even in the past few months – we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month. We’ll soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy. So far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download. The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p. We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of what’s left goes to the artist. What’s more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists. That’s one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction – it’s much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist. (See my Blog post on this here - ). WNAmazing Radio launched in mid-2009. How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures? PCIt’s gone mad since then. I’ve worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you). I’ve never known anything like it. The reaction has been absolutely incredible – and it’s growing faster than ever right now. The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback – masses of long emails from people we’ve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it. source=Paul Campbell We’ve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because – well, because we’re a bit mean really, and I’m not convinced they would accurately measure our audience. I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people. But the best guess I’ve heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB. That’s an estimate, but it came from a very wise source. We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But it’s all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this. WNDAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year. How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future? PCWe’re not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we can’t confirm or deny the cost. Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure it’s worth it. I’m reminded of that wonderful teachers’ union bumper sticker: ‘if you think education’s expensive, try ignorance’. If you think creating the world’s first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive …. try being inaudible. So far, we’ve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word ‘amazing’ into a global challenger brand. This year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast. They understand this scale of ambition there. Have you tuned into Amazing Radio? What did you think? WNWhat are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010? Any exciting announcements to come? PC‘Fraid so. In 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what you’re doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind. We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected. Blimey, I sound like some corporate twat. Now (obviously) it wouldn’t be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance – but basically, we’d like the message to spread that we’re doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so we’ll launch more new programmes and more new services – on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com. Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient. . There’ll be some video and some TV along soon too. And other cool stuff. It may not be ‘insanely cool’; just cool will do just fine. We also want to do it in other places. E.g. America. We’ve already started there. We’ll be unexpected there too. WNFinally, your favourite artist on Amazing Tunes/Radio at the moment? PCNow this will sound like a real cop-out, but I never ever say who my favourite artist is. It’s for a serious reason. I’m not some musical Einstein - I’m merely the bloke who started amazing. And I’m merely a drummer. My taste doesn’t matter. EVERYBODY’s musical taste does. One of the many problems of conventional record companies is that they think geezers in suits in big glass buildings have the right to decide what’s good music. We think the world does. I’ve found hundreds of incredible songs that I love, across loads of styles of music. You’ll find hundreds of your own. Enjoy. WNThank you very much for your time Paul. Good luck for 2010. PCThanks very much, we really appreciate it. 2010 is going to be amazing."
entertainment,"Stand-up comedian and sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld was ""honored"" Sunday in an HBO TV special entitled ""Jerry Seinfeld: The Comedian Award,"" hosted by CNN's Anderson Cooper and featuring fellow comedians Robert Klein, Chris Rock, and Garry Shandling as panel members. A several minute recording of Mr. Seinfeld's stand-up started off the event, but the focus was on the panel discussion. Topics included Jerry's decision to re-enter the world of stand-up comedy post-Seinfeld, his and Shandling's first gigs on The Tonight Show, and the panelists' typical methods for creating and presenting material. Klein also shared colorful anecdotes regarding his late mentor, Rodney Dangerfield. Though the Las Vegas ceremony was taped in 2005, for reasons not known its inaugural airing was not until now, several years later. Although HBO execs claim it was not originally intended for broadcast, the panelists referred to the event on-camera as a ""TV show"". Perhaps some of Seinfeld's derisive on-camera commentary is to blame for the delay. ""Your whole career as a comedian is about making fun of pretentious, high-minded, self-congratulatory, B.S. events like this one,"" he explained in his cutting acceptance speech as Cooper laughed uncomfortably with the crowd. ""I really don't want to be up here."" This, after long-time colleague Robert Klein praised Mr. Seinfeld's lack of reliance on ""mean-spirited"" or ""vulgar"" humor. Klein sought to draw contrast between Jerry and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, whose Curb Your Enthusiasm generates laughs from the sociopathic behavior of David's character. Explaining that he and the other panelists were only in attendance because they owed HBO for getting them their starts, Seinfeld seemed to prove Klein wrong. ""Awards are stupid,"" he said repeatedly. ""It's a jerkoff."" The show's debut was April 1 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, and it is also available on HBO's On Demand service."
entertainment,"United Kingdom Louise Straw, a solicitor representing UK television and radio presenter Stuart Hall, has said Hall is innocent of charges of indecent assault. In relation to complaints about alleged events between 1974 and 1984 involving three females between eight and seventeen years of age, Hall was charged with three counts of indecent assault after being arrested Wednesday. Hall, who has been released on bail, is expected to appear at Preston Magistrates' Court on January 7. Saying Hall was not able to provide any additional comment at present, Straw criticised the apparent ""systematic, measured leaks to the media, which have given a misleading impression of what this case is about."" She stressed it was ""a matter of concern"" given the recent release of the Leveson Report. Straw also said because police arrested Hall at his residence in the town of Wilmslow in Cheshire, he ""was not afforded the opportunity to attend voluntarily at the police station. In due course, the decision that he should be arrested will be the subject of some scrutiny"". John Dilworth of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was ""sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and ... it is in the public interest to prosecute this case."" Stating Hall was innocent, Straw explained: ""There will be a trial and his defence will then be in the public domain."" Hall &amp;mdash; who has recently been featuring as an association football commentator on BBC Radio 5 Live &amp;mdash; will not be working at the BBC as police inquiries continue because of ""the very serious nature of these charges"", a spokesperson for the corporation has said. Hall, who notably presented UK game show It's a Knockout, was given an OBE at the New Year Honours for services to charity and broadcasting. His broadcasting career has lasted some fifty years."

The director of the new movie, J. J. Abrams is expected to announce a ""few surprises,"" says a statement posted on the Comic-Con 2007 website. The conference is apparently to put to rest rumors that started to circulate online that Matt Damon was going to star in the new movie as Captain James T. Kirk. Damon later said in an interview with ign.com that he was ""too old"" to play the role and that it was nothing but an ""internet rumor"" and that he was not approached by anyone to be in the film. It is rumored that Leonard Nimoy will be cast as Spock, or that Zachary Quinto will play the role. It is also rumored that the movie will be a prequel to the TV show. According to IMDb the movie is going to be ""set before 'The Original Series' when Kirk and Spock are newly graduated Cadets fresh from Starfleet Academy and are sent on their first space mission."""
entertainment,"Long John Baldry, English-born blues legend, passed away at the Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Thursday evening after fighting a severe chest infection for the past four months. Baldry was considered an innovator and inspiration in blues music in the 1950s and 60s and is credited with inspiring other music legends such as Elton John, Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, and The Rolling Stones. Baldry was born in East Haddon, England, 1941-01-12 and grew to the imposing height of 6 feet 7 inches (2 metres) which gave him his nickname ""Long John"". He began playing folk and jazz music as a teenager in the 1950s but his deep voice resonated with the blues. Eric Clapton credits seeing Baldry play as an inspiration for him to play the blues himself. In the early 1960s Baldry sang with Alexis Korner's influential band, Blues Incorporated, and then went on to lead a series of bands himself and featured many new musicians who would go onto superstardom, including Rod Stewart, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Jack Bruce, and Jimmy Page. He befriended Paul McCartney while playing at the Cavern in Liverpool and performed on The Beatles' internationally televised special Around the Beatles in 1964. In 1966, Baldry adopted Bluesology for his back-up band, after seeing ""promise"" in the young keyboard player, Reginald Dwight. In 1968, Dwight adopted the name Elton John, taking the name John in tribute to Baldry. In 1978, he moved to the United States, spending time in New York and Los Angeles, before moving on to Vancouver permanently about 1980 and becoming a Canadian citizen. Baldry has released over 40 albums and, in the last twenty years, done much voice-over work in Canada for commercials and animations including ReBoot and narrating the Disney production, The Original Story Of Winnie-The-Pooh, which earned him a 1998 Grammy spoken word album for children nomination. Before his illness, it had been anticipated that Baldry would be touring in the autumn in support of new recordings produced by Rod Stewart and Elton John to be released this September."
entertainment,"A Yorkshire pub affected by flooding in 2007 has been named CAMRA's National Pub of the Year for 2008. The Kelham Island Tavern in Sheffield's Kelham Island Quarter was in a ""semi derelict"" state when it was purchased in 2001. After it was re-opened in 2002 by licensee Trevor Wraith and manager Lewis Gonda, business quickly picked up and the pub has been awarded Sheffield CAMRA's local Pub of the Year award for the past four years. The pub won the award despite six weeks of closure a year and a half ago when the pub's cellar and floor were affected by the flooding of the River Don and the nearby Kelham goit. The pub also received Yorkshire CAMRA's Pub of the Year award in 2004 and 2007.Trevor Wraith, licensee CAMRA's Pub of the Year award is judged in several stages, with local CAMRA branches evaluating the pubs in their area and passing on recommendations for regional championships. The list of regional champions is then whittled down to four finalists, with CAMRA judges visiting each of these anonymously before making a final decision. The pub regularly serves ten and often up to thirteen Real Ales, and variety and quality of beers served are of particular interest to CAMRA, which was founded in 1971 in order to preserve and promote traditional British beer and pubs, which the group see as threatened. However, other considerations beyond range and variety of beers are also important. Julian Hough, CAMRA's Pubs Director, made particular note of the Tavern's ""attention to detail"". Mr Wraith also pointed out the pub's ""sub-tropical"" beer garden, which he calls his ""pride and joy""; the pub was awarded Silver Gilts in the Yorkshire In Bloom competition every year since 2003 and has received the Gold Award in the local Sheffield In Bloom competition every year since 2005. The pub also regularly hosts evenings of folk music. Mr Gonda credited the pub's success to the ""excellent brewers we deal with, our faithful and supportive pub regulars, and our invaluable staff members."" It was this community support which helped the pub recover so quickly after the 2007 flooding, with Mr Wraith describing the day the waters entered the pub. ""The funny thing was that it was difficult to get the customers to evacuate. They just wanted to keep on drinking, but we did have to get them out eventually and some of them did get wet."" Flood defences were erected after the customers left, but to no avail; Mr Wraith stayed in the pub overnight, despite the flooding and the lack of electricity. The pub will be presented with the award in a ceremony later today at 1pm GMT."
entertainment,"The world's third largest supermarket chain, Tesco of Britain, announced intentions to start a film downloading service on the back of its successful music download service in the United Kingdom. Tesco takes a 10% share in the UK music download market, even though they are a late comer. The reason for the service is that Britain is one of the largest illegal downloaders of film and television programmes in the world, with many TV shows copied to PCs as soon as they are shown in the United States. Copies of The Simpsons, The O.C., Desperate Housewives and even Lost which is not available yet in the UK are found on p2p servers like Kazaa and BitTorrent. This is not the first company who has decided to start a film download service. The entertainment giant Sony has asked for such a service, plus the music downloader Wippet has already decided to introduce film downloading in the UK."

The model, nearly six feet tall and clad in a yellow dress with a microphone in hand, is said to bear a strong likeness to the singer. Her tattoos have even been reproduced to the last detail, including one of a lightning bolt. While her parents attended the event, Winehouse herself was too busy working to attend.

entertainment,"The online news agency The NewStandard (TNS), a U.S.-based daily dispatch service, ceased publications on Friday, April 27. The not for profit media organization run by the PeoplesNetWorks Collective out of Syracuse, New York was begun in 2004. The 5 staffers that run the collective said that the reason for closure was a ""lack of support"". An announcement made earlier this week on Monday said, As those familiar with us or our work can imagine, this was a tremendously difficult decision for us to reach. But the five staffers who form the PeoplesNetWorks Collective – the nonhierarchical nonprofit that publishes TNS – have accepted that the news publication we envisioned cannot be achieved without a greater level of support. We do not believe we will be able to obtain that support in the foreseeable future, and as individuals, we have reached a point at which we are unable to sustain the long hours and stress that publishing TNS entails. A Friday email to subscribers again announced that it would be the last daily dispatch, in what the publication called ""our unusual endeavor"", where unusual meant because it did not accept advertising revenue for any of its online page content. All TNS publications were ad free. Premium donors, those who donated US$10 or more each month, and contributions made by its readership and other organizations, funded the news agency during its 3 and a half year life. In this way, donations were the revenue substitute for advertising dollars. TNS came close to shutting down once before, over a year ago. Readers were warned of the pending end, and the publication managed to survive with financial support given by both large donors and small. The publication never took off according to an Alexa web traffic ranking result shown in a graph in the 'External links' section below. In comparison to The Washington Post, where the line on top in that graph represents their ranking, TNS was barely on the radar screen. The content of the online publication was derived from original and featured article reports written by contributors to the publication who were paid between $125 &amp;mdash; 100 per article. $50 &amp;mdash; $25 was paid to suppliers of news briefs derived mainly from other news agencies, and $25 to cartoonists for their published submissions. Contributors came from all areas of the United States, along with some international. Cartoonist Daryl Cagle, of CagleCartoons.com, who recently starting posting blog content on emails sent to subscribers of his featured cartoon of the day, blogged Wednesday this week in what he titled, Newspapers and Cartoonists Wandering Blindly: For many newspaper editors, internet strategy is a fantasy from the movie ""Field of Dreams."" ""If you build it, they will come."" Good content is nice (Slate has great original content) but securing a continuing audience for that content is more important. Yahoo and Google maintain top news sites with almost no original content. That's journalism 2.0: circulating content that is created in other media, while paying little or nothing for the content. Cagle, currently employed by MSNBC.com and formerly Slate, also remarked that, ""I still make my living selling cartoons that are printed in ink on paper from traditional clients who actually pay."" He said The Washington Post is one of the most visited online media outlets to grow out of the newsprint era. ""When The Washington Post Company bought my old employer Slate.com from Microsoft, the negotiations focused on Slate continuing to receive a huge audience flow from promotions on MSN.com. The Post understands the Web where traffic flows like a river - the river has to keep flowing or the lake will dry up."" Cagle said. The staffers that run TNS are in the process of wrapping things up and promise to as much of the site as possible for future reference, and give a fuller explanation for the site’s closure in this coming week."
entertainment,"The German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a pioneer of electronic music among major contemporary musicians, died on December 5. The German foundation, named in his honor, announced today, Stockhausen passed away in his Kürten home in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. A prolific composer, he wrote more than 300 works during his career, establishing himself as a pioneer of electronic music, as well as a representative of serialism. Studie I, dated 1953, is considered one of the first electronic music works ever produced. Born in Mödrath, Germany, in 1927, he was the son of a mother from a wealthy family and a father who was a teacher. He grew up in Altenberg, where he started taking piano lessons. He studied piano and music pedagogy at the Musikhochschule in Cologne. It was at University of Cologne, he later studied musicology, philosophy and Germanics. He was influenced by musicians such as Oliver Messiaen, Edgard Varèse, and Anton Webern, but also by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee. Stockhausen's works often departed from usual music styles. During his life as a musician, Stockhausen explored most of the genres and styles. Starting in punctualism and concrete music early in his career, during the 1950s, he proceeded to research the electronic music area, which at the time was in an embryonic state. In the 1960s, he composed works of choral music, putting side-by-side the chorus and the use of electronic facilities. In the 1970s, he dedicated himself to serialism. Between 1977 and 2003, he committed himself to one of his most ambitious projects: a cycle of thematic works named Licht: Die sieben Tage der Woche (Light: the Seven Days of the Week). Various artists have stated that they were influenced by Stokhausen, including artists as varied as Frank Zappa, Björk, Miles Davis, as well as Roger Waters and Rick Wright&amp;mdash;two of the Pink Floyd members. The Beatles included a portrait of Stockhausen among the people pictured on the cover of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Italian singer/songwriter Franco Battiato dedicated Sulle corde di Aries to the composer. While being a controversial artist, Stockhausen became a focus of polemics after he stated that the September 11, 2001 attacks were ""works of art"". He later explained the meaning of his statements, and said that they had been, according to him, out-of-context and misquoted."

entertainment,"It has been reported recently by Blabbermouth and DotMusic.com that two fans of Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi were robbed at gunpoint on Friday in Louisville, Kentucky, United States and the band's manager as well as a bodyguard were shot at. No-one was injured. Following a gig in Louisville the band had split up, with three of the members going to a nearby bar for a drink. Lead vocalist Mr. Lordi, his wife, and keyboardist Awa had entered the tour bus, while manager Rikk Scholvinck and a bodyguard were escorting two fans towards the bus. According to those at the scene, a van pulled up next to the bus and several youths emerged, at least one of which was carrying a gun. Mr Lordi describes what happened next: ""One of the men with a gun took a fan, a girl, put the gun to her head and forced her to lie down on the ground. Also one of the boys froze on the spot while the others fled away, including Rikk and the bodyguard while another man started shooting at them. Luckily he missed and no one was hurt. Rikk ran to the bar and called the police who arrived soon. In a moment we were surrounded by like five police cars but the guys managed to escape. They were a group of drug addicts that had stolen the car earlier that night, and police were already looking for them but have still not managed to catch them."" ""The girl that was held at gunpoint is obviously very shocked. We did our best to comfort and calm her down, but one can only wonder what could happen when people start running around with guns and even using them! It is a bit amusing that the boy fan was just happy he didn't lose the t-shirt he was wearing with all the autographs on it, even if they both lost everything else."" Both the fans were given lifelong all access passes to Lordi concerts worldwide to compensate. Lordi has had previous altercations with criminals in the US. Earlier this year the bus the band was using for their tour as part of Ozzfest was hijacked with several of the technical crew on board. During the same tour, two other fans were also robbed. ""This was like a deja vú of that, once again we were surrounded by police cars and their flashing lights,"" Mr Lordi commented."
entertainment,"Women's rights advocate and Georgetown University Law Center graduate Sandra Fluke has been named as a candidate by Time magazine for their Person of the Year. Sandra Fluke was the focus of media in February after attempting to testify before a Republican-controlled committee in the United States House of Representatives about contraception and women's health. Kate Pickert of Time wrote in her profile, ""Fluke ... weathered the attention with poise and maturity and emerged as a political celebrity."" Time magazine Time concluded Fluke helped give U.S. President Barack Obama an edge in his presidential re-election campaign: ""Democrats gave her a national-convention speaking slot as part of their push to make reproductive rights a central issue in the 2012 presidential campaign — one that helped Barack Obama trounce Mitt Romney among single women on Election Day."" 4=Sandra Fluke Fluke responded to the nomination via Twitter, and stated she was ""Honored to be listed for Time's Person of Year"". In the same statement she also drew attention to the scarcity of women on the list of candidates. An analysis of Fluke's candidacy by Peter Roff of U.S. News &amp; World Report called attention to her role in the political phenomenon in the recent election cycle known as the ""War on Women"" which drew significant attention to issues of women's rights. Roff gave advice to the Republican party on the way it relates to women, ""Once the Republicans become comfortable talking about all issues as though they were women's issues too — issues like unemployment, economic growth, job creation, education, and healthcare as well as the so-called social issues — they will be demonstrating that women have a home in the GOP. Until they do however it will be the Sandra Flukes of the world that continue to carry the day when it counts."" Journalist Leslie Marshall observed some conservative political commentators were critical of Time for its nomination of Fluke for Person of the Year. Leslie Marshall Marshall argued Fluke belongs on the list: ""She should be credited with reminding women on both the right and the left; that many of us agree on the issue of women's reproductive rights. Although some of us might be Democrats and some Republicans, our gender unites us. She brought more women to the polls, reminding us of the decades it took to be where we are and what was at stake for women if we did not re-elect President Obama. In speaking at the Democratic National Convention, she showed true strength over adversity. And she has since become a women's health activist. For these reasons alone, she belongs on this list."" However, Marshall stated she wouldn't be voting for Fluke's candidacy, but would instead cast her ballot for Malala Yousafzai, a 15-year-old female education activist who survived a Taliban assassination attempt. Fluke was a featured speaker on September 5 at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Fluke spoke to attendees at the convention about the consequences for women of electing Republican candidate for U.S. President, Mitt Romney, over incumbent President Barack Obama. Fluke has campaigned with President Obama in his bid for re-election. She was recognized April 22 with the Stand Up for Choice Award. Fluke was given the Stand Up for Choice Award at the ""Third Annual Multi-Generational Brunch"" of the organization NARAL Pro-Choice America which was held in New York City (NYC), New York in the United States. Fluke received a nomination in March as a candidate for Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. The list is released annually as a special edition of Time magazine, titled Time 100. She gave testimony to the US Congress on February 23 before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee at a hearing about women's health and contraception. She also worked for Sanctuary for Families in NYC which worked to crack down on human trafficking and domestic violence. HYS"

While students, part of an inner-city breakfast club, had the opportunity to tour the Parliament Buildings at length, Harper stayed far away from the quick, scheduled hello. He failed to even send an MP in his place, to the event, scheduled as part of Black History Month. Every other political party with seats in Parliament sent a representative to greet the visitors. Present was the deputy leader of the Liberal opposition party, Michael Ignatieff, and prominent NDP MP Olivia Chow, who is the wife of NDP leader Jack Layton. While Chow and Ignatieff both hold office in Toronto, where the Citytv broadcasts to, and the Conservatives were shut out of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), even those without self-interest dropped by. Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe spoke to the students, despite the fact his party only runs candidates in Quebec. City's coverage of the tour focused on what the students did see, rather than what they missed. Harper seems to have made a regular practice of ignoring or delaying scheduled visits. Canadian Auto Workers union leader Buzz Hargrove mentioned he has yet to talk to the Prime Minister. Hargrove represents over 265,000 workers in every province and territory in Canada."

entertainment,"The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has refused to issue a certificate for Grotesque. The move makes it illegal to sell the Japanese horror film in the United Kingdom. BBFC director David Cooke described the piece as containing ""unacceptable content"" and being ""little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation, brutality and sadism"". He said that cuts were ""not a viable option"". The movie includes scenes of castration, disembowelment and amputation. The BBFC has only rejected a handful of other films in the last four years out of the 10,000 it reviews for DVD release every year. These include the sexually violent Murder-Set-Pieces and Terrorists, Killers And Other Wackos, a film showing graphic clips of real-life torture and killing. Cooke said Grotesque's ""chief pleasure... seems to be in the spectacle of sadism (including sexual sadism) for its own sake."" The BBFC's only other recent rejections have been two pornographic films seeking the R18 rating. Grotesques creators had hoped the film would receive an 18 rating, which is below R18. Cooke also said that the film was different from other violent horrors due to its ""minimal narrative or character development."""
entertainment,"The James Bond film series is one of the most popular and successful, having grossed over US$4 billion worldwide. The suave, sophisticated secret agent has secured his place in popular culture as the definitive action hero that has appeared in twenty-three films between 1954 and 2006. Daniel Craig was announced as the seventh actor to portray 007 in late 2005, making his debut in the 2006 smash hit Casino Royale. While fans await Craig's second outing in Quantum of Solace, due later this year, they have been able to watch Shamelady, a fan film made by the French film production company Constellation Studios. Shamelady is a tribute to Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels on which many of the films are based, and EON Productions, the makers of the official 007 films. The film was first released in 2007 and runs just under an hour long. It can be downloaded from Constellation's website or viewed on YouTube. Legally, the filmmakers cannot profit from Shamelady, but they didn't make it for the money, rather the thrill of creating an original Bond film. The plot is fairly simple, and reminiscent of Casino Royale. Bond is sent to a casino to nab a vicious crime lord, but gets betrayed by a fellow agent in the process. Viewer reaction to the film was positive for the most part, and Constellation Studios has now planned a sequel to Shamelady, which director Eric Saussine speaks of in the interview below. Wikinews (Joseph Ford)Although having made several other movies, Constellation Studios is best known for the acclaimed James Bond fan film Shamelady. Tell us about it. : Eric Saussine: Shamelady attempts to be a true James Bond adventure, except in length. Our 007 lasts 54 minutes. The story takes place in Iraq, England and France. James Bond is sent to the south of France to buy information about a secret organization that terrorizes Great Britain. During the operation, a couple of killers put a deadly stop to the exchange. Bond escapes, whereas Mangin - who provided the information - is killed. For MI6, it's vivid evidence that S.P.E.C.T.R.E. - the criminal organization to which James Bond was formerly opposed - is back. From this point, Bond goes to the casino of Luc-sur-Mer, Normandy, in search of Descarpes who is suspected of being the number 2 of the organization. Bond challenges Descarpes at the roulette table and seduces Anna Raykova, a mysterious Russian woman working for his adversary. Our favorite spy escapes several murder attempts but, in a nod to Casino Royale, he soon realizes that he is being betrayed. Anyway, the bad guy dies in the end! Some things are eternal. Shamelady is a tribute to the men at the origin of the myth: original author Ian Fleming and James Bond producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli. WN (Joseph Ford)Why did you make this film? Where did the inspiration for Shamelady come from? : Eric Saussine: In 1953, Ian Fleming created James Bond and therefore the myth we all know. In 2003, for the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of Ian Fleming's hero, I thought that it was time to pay tribute to this literary and cinema myth . In September 2004, I called his friend Pierre Rodiac, a former president a French James Bond fan club. I talked to him about my idea to adapt Casino Royale, the only Ian Fleming James Bond novel that was not seriously adapted by Eon, holder of the movie rights. Pierre was excited by the project and he started writing a synopsis. We worked alternatively on it. It gave way to a script which I wrote and Pierre corrected, that was a faithful adaptation of the novel, with all the trademarks of the movie franchise. Then I immediately started the search for actors and locations. : On February 3, 2005, Eon Productions announced that Martin Campbell would direct the 21st film of the series. The title was... Casino Royale! : I was happy because I had always wanted to see that. I went back to work on my project. I decided to preserve the general plot, change the names of the villains, the bad guy's plan, a few scenes and re-introduced a well known terrorist organization and its chief from the Bond films and novels : S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and Ernst Stavro Blofeld. I wrote a new script in a couple of months and found its title : Shamelady. Pre-production started in 2004. Filming started in 2005 and went on in 2006. Post-production took place in 2007 and the release date was December 11, 2007. WN (Joseph Ford)Last summer, you announced that Constellation Studios is at work on another Bond film, Shatterhand. Tell us about it. : Eric Saussine: Well, the team was so happy to do Shamelady. At the end of this movie we were tired but response from the team members themselves that the first of them, Serge Rotelli (Bond) asked that we do another one. Of course I had many ideas going wild in many directions in my mind. So following that wave of enthusiasm I decided to renew the experience and launched the production of a new James Bond 007 adventure. This time, the film will be our way to celebrate Ian Fleming's hundredth birthday. : The plot will stay close to Fleming's literary works and will be derived from the short story Octopussy, the last third of the novel You Only Live Twice, hence the title, Shatterhand, which is Blofeld's pseudonym in that adventure. The new film also includes an original ski chase in the pre-credit sequence and an explosive action finale. Some shots were done for real in Japan. We will probably miss the Fleming centenary in 2008 and will probably release it one year later. WN (Joseph Ford)Is this the beginning of a series of non-profit fan films? After Shatterhand, can we expect to see more Bond films from you? : Eric Saussine: It was never seen as a series, but when we released Shamelady, Shatterhand's production was already half-way, and the people at the premiere kept saying to me that they wanted to participate and that I should do a trilogy. Nothing's worth a trilogy. So given the extraordinary willingness of some people we are thinking about one final chapter. Of course my ever-boiling mind has some idea ready. I can tell you that part of a final chapter could take place in Switzerland and that we might see Piz Gloria again for a few seconds. Other than that I am still in the middle of Shatterhand so all this stuff about a third movie is just wishful thinking. WN (Joseph Ford)Do you have any advice for amateur filmmakers reading this? : Eric Saussine: Never, ever abandon your project. Too many projects fail or disappear because people don't have the will to go til the end of their ideas and realize that it is much more complicated than they thought it would be and then they drop it. It is a pity. Another advice : steal from the best i.e. the Bond movies for Bond productions, Spielberg, Kubrick and all the others for all movies. Mozart stole from Haydn and transcended him.

The video has attracted over thirty-five million views since its February 10 upload &amp;mdash; and critics think it could be the world's worst. Simon Cowell Ark Music Factory produced the song and video, using US$2,000 (£1,223, C$1,964, €1,412) from Black's mother. Fridays video was shot at Black's father's house, with her family and friends as extras. The song beat an alternative track when choosing what to record. The single is climbing up the iTunes singles chart in the United Kingdom and the United States, gaining a higher position in the US than Canadian singer Justin Bieber. Despite the song's popularity, it has received a largely negative reception. According to Newsbeat, critics have cited Friday as being ""the worst song of all time."" On YouTube, the video attracted approximately thirty-six thousand 'likes' versus over 314,000 'dislikes'. The song itself has been ridiculed for its lyrics and criticised for its use of Auto-Tune. Feeling ""like she was being cyber-bullied,"" Rebecca Black said ""when I first saw all these nasty comments I thought this is all my fault, ... this was all because of me."" Black says of ""those hurtful comments"", the worst was ""I hope you cut yourself and I hope you get an eating disorder so you look pretty. I hope you cut and die."" Clarence Jey, of Ark Music Factory, offered to take the video off YouTube, but Black declined. In contrast, British music executive Simon Cowell has expressed a positive interest in Rebecca Black. ""I love her and the fact she's gotten so much publicity,"" Cowell commented. ""People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. I want to meet her. Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that."" Rebecca Black herself wants to record a duet with Justin Bieber. ""I have Bieber fever &amp;mdash; I am in love with Justin Bieber,"" Black commented. The teenager said it ""would be unbelievable and make my life""."
entertainment,"New Zealand Italian car company, Fiat, has used the haka to advertise its new car and New Zealand diplomats says it is culturally insensitive. The ads have gone to air in Italy and are viewable on their website. The ad features woman wearing black and performing the haka: Ka Mate, which was written by the chief of Ngāti Toa, Te Rauparaha. It is also the haka that is performed before every rugby game played by the New Zealand team, All Blacks. The women perform the haka beside the new Fiat car and crowd noise is in the background to simulate the atmosphere in an All Blacks rugby match. As the haka is finished a woman drives away in the Fiat car and a boy in the back of the car pokes out his tongue, which is the action used to finish the haka. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) said that they were told in April that an advertising company was planning to use the haka. Yesterday (July 3) Brad Tattersfield, a spokesman for MFAT, said ""at the time we advised the advertising company that the use of Ka Mate in this way was culturally insensitive and inappropriate. MFAT advised the advertisers to either use a Maori group or a haka composed for women. However, the advertising company indicated they were proceeding despite this advice."" Garry Nicholas, general manager of Te Toi Aoteroa, which promotes and protects Maori art and culture, said that he felt mixed feelings about the ad. ""This isn't a haka in my view but is certainly based on haka. It's meant to be in fun and the little boy poking his tongue at the end of the clip makes that very clear."""

entertainment,"It has been nearly 27 years since Nicole, then a high school student from the Saarland in extreme western Germany, sang a heartfelt plea for world peace on the stage at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Harrogate, North Yorkshire in the United Kingdom. That simple message was wrapped with success; she became the first German in Contest history to take home the grand prize. The song was a brainchild of her former record producer, Ralph Siegel, and would be their greatest achievement in their nearly three-decade partnership. Afterward, she was propelled to stardom across Europe by recording versions of her winning song, ""Ein bißchen Frieden"" (A little peace), in many European languages. To this day, it was the last winning Eurovision song to top the charts in the United Kingdom; it also has the distinction of being the 500th #1 single on the British charts. This newfound fame brought her music to audiences across Europe, and in time, into Asia as well. By the end of the 1980s, however, her fame subsided somewhat and she refocused her career domestically. Since 1980, she has released over 30 albums in Germany; her most recent offering, Mitten ins Herz (Right into your heart), was accompanied by a three-month ""unplugged"" tour that ended in the third week of January. Now off the road, Nicole spoke with Wikinews' Mike Halterman about her past success, her life and career today, and her overall impressions of the Eurovision Song Contest, both past and present. This is the first in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow. Eurovision Mike Halterman You started out performing at the age of 6. Was this an interest you really wanted to pursue at such a young age? Did you ever feel pressured by your family in any way to succeed musically, or were they very supportive? Nicole: Actually, I started out performing at the age of 4. When I got my first applause, it was clear to me what my profession would be, and my family gave me the utmost support. MH When did you start to consider music as a full-time career? Nicole: At the age of 16, after the great success I had with my first record, Flieg nicht so hoch, mein kleiner Freund (Don't fly so high, my little friend). MH You started your partnership with Ralph Siegel back when you were 16. How did he decide to give you a record contract? Did you have any doubts about signing it? Nicole: He was the first one who believed in me after hearing my voice and I had no doubt that he was the right person for a musical partnership. MH Did any of your inspirations and goals change when you signed your record contract, or appeared in Eurovision? Nicole: I was trying to find my own way. After I signed my record contract everything changed. Especially after winning the Eurovision Song Contest. MH Were you ever torn about eventually putting your singing over your guitar skills? Nicole: I liked playing the guitar in ""Ein bißchen Frieden"". It was a good combination, wasn't it? Afterwards I put the guitar ""into the corner"" so I could be more mobile on stage. MH The bookmakers Ladbrokes had the United Kingdom as the favorite to win back in 1982. Going into the Contest, especially knowing that Germany hadn't won at that point, did you feel daunted? Nicole: I expected to win. After the first rehearsal, everybody could feel the magic of the song and its message. It was my song! MH Many of the songs and performers who performed for Germany before you performed sweeping ballads, with dramatic melodies, in sometimes very showy performances. And here you come in, a young girl from the Saarland, guitar in hand, singing a modest offering, asking for peace. Do you feel the lack of complexity in the song and performance perhaps gave it a special kind of appeal? Nicole: I was honest in everything I said and sang what the people were thinking at that time. Asking for peace was also in their minds. MH During the 1980s, you had a string of hits in Germany, and released singles and albums across Europe and into Asia as well. Whose idea was it to give you exposure in Asia? Nicole: It was the idea of the record company and Ralph Siegel. MH Did you have pleasant experiences doing promotional tours over there? What thing do you remember most fondly? Nicole: We went to the Tokyo Yamaha Festival and won second place there with ""So viele Lieder sind in mir"" (There are so many songs inside me). I learned to introduce myself to people in Japanese. That's what I remember fondly and I haven't forgotten one word to this day. MH You've continued to release albums nearly every year since the early 1980s, but a lot of your mainstream chart success ended in that decade as well. Did you feel discouraged when that started to happen? Nicole: Not really. I've now been in this business for 29 years. I take it as an Olympic swimming competition. There's an A-final and a B-final. You don't have to be first every time, but you have to take care and swim with the others in the A-final. MH In many European circles, ""schlager"" is almost looked upon as if it were a dirty word, synonymous with ""uncool"" or ""out of touch."" Do you feel that common threads in schlager songs (namely love and feelings) get stigmatized and mocked, and do you think that's fair? Nicole: That doesn't faze me much. To me, the audience is the most important thing. I did an unplugged tour a few weeks ago with all the songs from the last three decades. It was fantastic to get standing ovations (nearly 20 minutes every evening). MH Where was your favorite place to perform? Nicole: The best place to perform was the ""Schmidt's Tivoli"" in Hamburg where we also recorded the ""Live DVD."" MH In your long career, you have released over 30 albums. Do you have any regrets as far as directions your career has taken? If you could do anything over again, would you? Nicole: I would do the same all over again, no doubt! MH And 27 years later, you remain the only Eurovision winner from Germany. Nicole: In 1982, it was the right song, with the right girl, at the right place. As I said before, it was a three-minute magic moment when I was on stage. An honest girl with an honest authentic song, telling a message everybody understood. MH Some of the German performers and entries in recent years had inventive themes, especially Roger Cicero's swing song and Texas Lightning's country performance. How do you feel about these ""theme"" entries? Nicole: In my opinion, every artist should be authentic, no matter what kind of song. MH Do you feel the allegations of ""bloc voting,"" favoring Eastern European countries over Western European countries (of which Germany is a part), are true? Also with the advent of telephone voting, do you feel the Contest has drifted in a direction where Eurovision is no longer ""about the song""? Nicole: Yes, it's true. The eastern European countries obviously support each other with the so-called ""bloc voting."" It's now a political affair and no longer a ""song contest."" MH Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the German representative? Nicole: No. I can't top being #1. MH Will you be a part of the German delegation going to Moscow this year? If no decision has been made yet, would you like to go? Nicole: I haven't been asked yet, but of course I would like to be a part of the German delegation. Eurovision is still on my mind. MH In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans who have followed your career these past three decades? Nicole: I want to thank all my fans for their loyalty and believing in me and my music. Thanks for walking side by side with me through the years."

Abdul is one of the three judges of the talent/variety program, where she is popularly referred to as the ""nice one"" by contestants. Fox reportedly hired a former federal prosecutor to lead an investigation into whether Abdul compromised the integrity of its flagship series.

Clark was booted from the second season of Idol after it was discovered he hid a previous domestic violence arrest record from producers.

entertainment,"The U.S. television network ABC says its 24-hour news network, ABC News Now, will become a permanent 24-hour television news network starting in July. Currently, the operation is only available on the Internet as a streaming media web site. The network started as a experiment by the Walt Disney Company-owned ABC in the summer of 2004 during the U.S. presidential campaign nomination conventions. It was mostly broadcast as a subchannel or shared channel within the bandwidth of an existing digital television (DTV) channel already owned by ABC. For instance if the local ABC affiliate is on Channel 7 with a DTV channel of 23, then ABC News Now may have been available on digital channel 23.1, sharing the same bandwidth. Because few households in the U.S. are equipped to tune in digital over-the-air sub-channels, and virtually none are carried on local cable companies, ratings were low for the fledgling digital channel. Adding to that technical difficulty, cable carriage of the network was small. ABC News Now was delivered to only 6 of the 110 million U.S. households via cable. Most viewers of the network, 30 million at last count, watched the network via the Internet. Citing money reasons, ABC shuttered the over-the-air ABC News Now broadcasts in January to focus on building the web-based service. But come July, ABC plans to return its news network and its 20 original programs to local TV stations. Without any commitment from national cable or satellite companies, ABC will return to digital sub-channels on local DTV transmissions."

The lead single from the album, Missä Miehet Ratsastaa, is Finland's entry at the 2008 instalment of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. The song reached number two on the Finnish singles chart and is currently number four. Missä Miehet Ratsastaa will be performed at the Eurovision semi-final on May 20. If enough other nations vote for the entry, it will proceed to the final in Belgrade, Serbia."
entertainment,"United Kingdom The BBC have announced the appointment of Bob Shennan as controller for BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music. Shennan was previously controller at news and sports station BBC Radio Five Live and head of Channel 4's abortive 4 Digital Group radio venture. Channel 4 had won a licence to launch three digital radio stations but dropped the plans at an advanced stage in the face of the economic downturn. At Five Live Shennan increased listening figures to 7 million. Critics claimed that this was achieved through the introduction of phone-in shows and a decline in coverage of harder news. He also launched the part-time digital-only station BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra. The BBC's director of Audio and Music told The Stage that Shennan is ""an outstanding leader with extensive radio experience and a proven track record in station management"". He said that ""Bob's energy, enthusiasm and passion for Radio 2 will ensure that the station remains creative and vibrant, and continues to offer unique programmes to the widest possible audience"". Radio 2 is Britain's most popular radio station with 13.06 million listeners and a 16% share. 6 Music is the network's digital-only sister station. The post of controller became vacant last year when Lesley Douglas resigned following the scandal over crude phone calls made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to actor Andrew Sachs during a pre-recorded music programme."
entertainment,"Bat for Lashes is the doppelgänger band ego of one of the leading millennial lights in British music, Natasha Khan. Caroline Weeks, Abi Fry and Lizzy Carey comprise the aurora borealis that backs this haunting, shimmering zither and glockenspiel peacock, and the only complaint coming from the audience at the Bowery Ballroom last Tuesday was that they could not camp out all night underneath these celestial bodies. We live in the age of the lazy tendency to categorize the work of one artist against another, and Khan has had endless exultations as the next Björk and Kate Bush; Sixousie Sioux, Stevie Nicks, Sinead O'Connor, the list goes on until it is almost meaningless as comparison does little justice to the sound and vision of the band. ""I think Bat For Lashes are beyond a trend or fashion band,"" said Jefferson Hack, publisher of Dazed &amp; Confused magazine. ""Khan has an ancient power...she is in part shamanic."" She describes her aesthetic as ""powerful women with a cosmic edge"" as seen in Jane Birkin, Nico and Cleopatra. And these women are being heard. ""I love the harpsichord and the sexual ghost voices and bowed saws,"" said Radiohead's Thom Yorke of the track Horse and I. ""This song seems to come from the world of Grimm's fairytales."" Bat's debut album, Fur And Gold, was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize, and they were seen as the dark horse favorite until it was announced Klaxons had won. Even Ladbrokes, the largest gambling company in the United Kingdom, had put their money on Bat for Lashes. ""It was a surprise that Klaxons won,"" said Khan, ""but I think everyone up for the award is brilliant and would have deserved to win."" Natasha recently spoke with David Shankbone about art, transvestism and drug use in the music business. ---- DS: Do you have any favorite books? :NK: Laughs I'm not the best about finishing books. What I usually do is I will get into a book for a period of time, and then I will dip into it and get the inspiration and transformation in my mind that I need, and then put it away and come back to it. But I have a select rotation of cool books, like Women Who Run With the Wolves by Clarissa Pinkola Estés and Little Birds by Anaïs Nin. Recently, Catching the Big Fish by David Lynch. DS: Lynch just came out with a movie last year called Inland Empire. I interviewed John Vanderslice last night at the Bowery Ballroom and he raved about it! :NK: I haven't seen it yet! DS: Do you notice a difference between playing in front of British and American audiences? :NK: The U.S. audiences are much more full of expression and noises and jubilation. They are like, ""Welcome to New York, Baby!"" ""You're Awesome!"" and stuff like that. Whereas in England they tend to be a lot more reserved. Well, the English are, but it is such a diverse culture you will get the Spanish and Italian gay guys at the front who are going crazy. I definitely think in America they are much more open and there is more excitement, which is really cool. DS: How many instruments do you play and, please, include the glockenspiel in that number. :NK: Laughs I think the number is limitless, hopefully. I try my hand at anything I can contribute; I only just picked up the bass, really— DS: --I have a great photo of you playing the bass. :NK: I don't think I'm very good... DS: You look cool with it! :NK: Laughs Fine. The glockenspiel...piano, mainly, and also the harp. Guitar, I like playing percussion and drumming. I usually speak with all my drummers so that I write my songs with them in mind, and we'll have bass sounds, choir sounds, and then you can multi-task with all these orchestral sounds. Through the magic medium of technology I can play all kinds of sounds, double bass and stuff. DS: Do you design your own clothes? :NK: All four of us girls love vintage shopping and charity shops. We don't have a stylist who tells us what to wear, it's all very much our own natural styles coming through. And for me, personally, I like to wear jewelery. On the night of the New York show that top I was wearing was made especially for me as a gift by these New York designers called Pepper + Pistol. And there's also my boyfriend, who is an amazing musician— DS: —that's Will Lemon from Moon and Moon, right? There is such good buzz about them here in New York. :NK: Yes! They have an album coming out in February and it will fucking blow your mind! I think you would love it, it's an incredible masterpiece. It's really exciting, I'm hoping we can do a crazy double unfolding caravan show, the Bat for Lashes album and the new Moon and Moon album: that would be really theatrical and amazing! Will prints a lot of my T-shirts because he does amazing tapestries and silkscreen printing on clothes. When we play there's a velvety kind of tapestry on the keyboard table that he made. So I wear a lot of his things, thrift store stuff, old bits of jewelry and antique pieces. DS: You are often compared to Björk and Kate Bush; do those constant comparisons tend to bother you as an artist who is trying to define herself on her own terms? :NK: No, I mean, I guess that in the past it bothered me, but now I just feel really confident and sure that as time goes on my musical style and my writing is taking a pace of its own, and I think in time the music will speak for itself and people will see that I'm obviously doing something different. Those women are fantastic, strong, risk-taking artists— DS: —as are you— :NK: —thank you, and that's a great tradition to be part of, and when I look at artists like Björk and Kate Bush, I think of them as being like older sisters that have come before; they are kind of like an amazing support network that comes with me. DS: I'd imagine it's preferable to be considered the next Björk or Kate Bush instead of the next Britney. :NK: Laughs Totally! Exactly! I mean, could you imagine—oh, no I'm not going to try to offend anyone now! Laughs Let's leave it there. DS: Does music feed your artwork, or does you artwork feed your music more? Or is the relationship completely symbiotic? :NK: I think it's pretty back-and-forth. I think when I have blocks in either of those area, I tend to emphasize the other. If I'm finding it really difficult to write something I know that I need to go investigate it in a more visual way, and I'll start to gather images and take photographs and make notes and make collages and start looking to photographers and filmmakers to give me a more grounded sense of the place that I'm writing about, whether it's in my imagination or in the characters. Whenever I'm writing music it's a very visual place in my mind. It has a location full of characters and colors and landscapes, so those two things really compliment each other, and they help the other one to blossom and support the other. They are like brother and sister. DS: When you are composing music, do you see notes and words as colors and images in your mind, and then you put those down on paper? :NK: Yes. When I'm writing songs, especially lately because I think the next album has a fairly strong concept behind it and I'm writing the songs, really imagining them, so I'm very immersed into the concept of the album and the story that is there through the album. It's the same as when I'm playing live, I will imagine I see a forest of pine trees and sky all around me and the audience, and it really helps me. Or I'll just imagine midnight blue and emerald green, those kind of Eighties colors, and they help me. DS: Is it always pine trees that you see? :NK: Yes, pine trees and sky, I guess. DS: What things in nature inspire you? :NK: I feel drained thematically if I'm in the city too long. I think that when I'm in nature—for example, I went to Big Sur last year on a road trip and just looking up and seeing dark shadows of trees and starry skies really gets me and makes me feel happy. I would sit right by the sea, and any time I have been a bit stuck I will go for a long walk along the ocean and it's just really good to see vast horizons, I think, and epic, huge, all-encompassing visions of nature really humble you and give you a good sense of perspective and the fact that you are just a small particle of energy that is vibrating along with everything else. That really helps. DS: Are there man-made things that inspire you? :NK: Things that are more cultural, like open air cinemas, old Peruvian flats and the Chelsea Hotel. Funny old drag queen karaoke bars... DS: I photographed some of the famous drag queens here in New York. They are just such great creatures to photograph; they will do just about anything for the camera. I photographed a famous drag queen named Miss Understood who is the emcee at a drag queen restaurant here named Lucky Cheng's. We were out in front of Lucky Cheng's taking photographs and a bus was coming down First Avenue, and I said, ""Go out and stop that bus!"" and she did! It's an amazing shot. :NK: Oh. My. God. DS: If you go on her Wikipedia article it's there. :NK: That's so cool. I'm really getting into that whole psychedelic sixties and seventies Paris Is Burning and Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis. Things like The Cockettes. There seems to be a bit of a revolution coming through that kind of psychedelic drag queen theater. DS: There are just so few areas left where there is natural edge and art that is not contrived. It's taking a contrived thing like changing your gender, but in the backdrop of how that is still so socially unacceptable. :NK: Yeah, the theatrics and creativity that go into that really get me. I'm thinking about The Fisher King...do you know that drag queen in The Fisher King? There's this really bad and amazing drag queen guy in it who is so vulnerable and sensitive. He sings these amazing songs but he has this really terrible drug problem, I think, or maybe it's a drink problem. It's so bordering on the line between fabulous and those people you see who are so in love with the idea of beauty and elevation and the glitz and the glamor of love and beauty, but then there's this really dark, tragic side. It's presented together in this confusing and bewildering way, and it always just gets to me. I find it really intriguing. DS: How are you received in the Pakistani community? :NK: Laughs I have absolutely no idea! You should probably ask another question, because I have no idea. I don't have contact with that side of my family anymore. DS: When you see artists like Pete Doherty or Amy Winehouse out on these suicidal binges of drug use, what do you think as a musician? What do you get from what you see them go through in their personal lives and with their music? :NK: It's difficult. The drugs thing was never important to me, it was the music and expression and the way he delivered his music, and I think there's a strange kind of romantic delusion in the media, and the music media especially, where they are obsessed with people who have terrible drug problems. I think that's always been the way, though, since Billie Holiday. The thing that I'm questioning now is that it seems now the celebrity angle means that the lifestyle takes over from the actual music. In the past people who had musical genius, unfortunately their personal lives came into play, but maybe that added a level of romance, which I think is pretty uncool, but, whatever. I think that as long as the lifestyle doesn't precede the talent and the music, that's okay, but it always feels uncomfortable for me when people's music goes really far and if you took away the hysteria and propaganda of it, would the music still stand up? That's my question. Just for me, I'm just glad I don't do heavy drugs and I don't have that kind of problem, thank God. I feel that's a responsibility you have, to present that there's a power in integrity and strength and in the lifestyle that comes from self-love and assuredness and positivity. I think there's a real big place for that, but it doesn't really get as much of that ""Rock n' Roll"" play or whatever. DS: Is it difficult to come to the United States to play considering all the wars we start? :NK: As an English person I feel equally as responsible for that kind of shit. I think it is a collective consciousness that allows violence and those kinds of things to continue, and I think that our governments should be ashamed of themselves. But at the same time, it's a responsibility of all of our countries, no matter where you are in the world to promote a peaceful lifestyle and not to consciously allow these conflicts to continue. At the same time, I find it difficult to judge because I think that the world is full of shades of light and dark, from spectrums of pure light and pure darkness, and that's the way human nature and nature itself has always been. It's difficult, but it's just a process, and it's the big creature that's the world; humankind is a big creature that is learning all the time. And we have to go through these processes of learning to see what is right."
entertainment,"__NOTOC__ The sale of the BBC subsidiary BBC Resources Ltd., has hit a hurdle after it emerged that the BBC could be left with a loss of up to £15 million on the deal. The cost of transferring the pensions of BBC Resources staff from the BBC pension scheme to its new owners could be up to £50 million according to a Guardian Newspaper report. Managers from the division will meet with union representatives from BECTU on Monday to discuss this and related sale issues. BECTU general secretary, Gerry Morrissey is quoted as saying: ""If the BBC gets less than £50 million for BBC Resources then how can it fulfil sic its duty of care to licence fee payers?"" It is believed that the BBC had hoped that a surplus in its pension fund could be used to bridge the possible £50 million gap — but the trustees of the fund have said ""no"". A BBC source said: ""This is being discussed at the highest level"". Since April 2004 members of the BBC pension scheme have seen their contributions into it increase regularly, the BBC — like many other employers — having reduced its contribution (to 4.5% of payroll) over a ten year period when the stock market was booming in the 1990s. The Guardian is seen as a reliable source on BBC matters, having reported the proposed sale of BBC Television Centre back in January 2007, with the formal announcement finally being made by BBC Director General Mark Thompson on October 18, 2007. The Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 and operates television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for it's parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being staff and equipment. Advertised for sale on 16th August in the Financial Times, The Times and Broadcast and last year making profits of £5.2 million with a revenue of £126 million, the disposal — led by Ernst &amp; Young — invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately. The BBC has yet to release the names of the short-listed companies. BBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial business-to-business divisions to be set up as a limited company and will be the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and BBC Broadcast — BBC Worldwide, formerly BBC Enterprises, will remain in-house as it earns revenue from the , media and licensing of products — in the year to 31 March 2007 Worldwide had a turnover of £810.4 million, generating profits of £111 million. The BBC wants to use any money raised to be put into international commercial expansion and content, most probably through Worldwide. It had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and ACAS talks in June 2005 — the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July of this year. The current time-scale would see its disposal by the end of the current financial year in March 2008."
entertainment,"Wikinews held an exclusive interview with author and filmmaker John Gaspard. His films Resident Alien, Beyond Bob and Grown Men, besides opening to positive critical response, were all made on very low budgets; costing around US$30,000. He says this is because ""I despise the process of trying to raise money to finance movies."" He has also written several books on filmmaking, most notably Digital Filmmaking 101. He says that it was ""originally.....a series of notes to ourselves, to remind us of the steps we took to make a feature for very little money. We later expanded those notes into a complete book to provide beginning filmmakers with the tools they would need to make a feature for what most Hollywood films spend on coffee and rolls."" Gaspard has written two other books as well. Fast, Cheap and Under Control: Lessons Learned From the Greatest Low-Budget Movie of All Time features interviews with some of the world's most well known low budget filmmakers, including B-movie king Roger Corman and actor-turned-director Tom Noonan. Fast, Cheap and Written that Way: Top Screenwriters on Writing for Low-Budget Movies features interviews with successful screenwriters who have written for low budget films. Wikinews: You've directed three films (Resident Alien, Beyond Bob and Grown Men). Tell us about them. : Mr. Gaspard: Since I despise the process of trying to raise money to finance movies, each movie was written specifically to be shot on an ultra-low budget. : Resident Alien and Beyond Bob were produced on 16mm film, and each cost a little under $30,000 to produce. : Resident Alien, a science fiction-comedy feature film, is the story of a UFO crash that changes the lives of two down-on-their-luck people in a small Midwestern town. The Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper said, ""Resident Alien is the best low-budget project to come out of the area."" : Beyond Bob, an award-winning comedy from the other side, is a story of love and friendship, of passion from beyond the grave, of a love that was made in heaven ... and was just too darned important to stay there. Beyond Bob was recently awarded the ""Best Feature"" award at the Forx Film Festival; it also received an Honorable Mention at the Seventh Annual George Lindsey UNA Film Festival, and a Bronze Award at the WorldFest Houston. : Grown Men is a digital feature, consisting of five interlocking stories from four Minnesota writers: Rewired by David Fields, It’s A Date and The Late Mrs. Boynton by John Gaspard, The $1,000 Wedding by Tom Poole, and Red Velvet Handcuffs by Matthew G. Anderson. : Grown Men premiered at the Ashland Independent Film Festival. It was named ""Best of the Fest - Best Feature Screenplay"" at the Black Point Film Festival in Lake Geneva. It was also featured at the New York International Independent Film &amp; Video Festival; the Waterfront Film Festival; the Oxford Film Festival; and the Tambay Film Festival. WN: You're the author and co-author of several books, most notably Digital Filmmaking 101. Tell us about them. What inspires you to write? : Mr. Gaspard: We wrote Digital Filmmaking 101 originally as a series of notes to ourselves, to remind us of the steps we took to make a feature for very little money. We later expanded those notes into a complete book to provide beginning filmmakers with the tools they would need to make a feature for what most Hollywood films spend on coffee and rolls. : My second book, Fast, Cheap and Under Control: Lessons Learned From the Greatest Low-Budget Movie of All Time, was designed to help keep new filmmakers from re-inventing the wheel every time they go out to make a feature. There is a wealth of knowledge in the low-budget movies that have come before ours, and it's a foolish filmmaker who doesn't heed those lessons. In the book I talked to both old-school low-budget filmmakers (like Roger Corman) and people from the current generation (Swingers, The Blair Witch Project, Open Water, etc.). : The latest book, Fast, Cheap and Written that Way: Top Screenwriters on Writing for Low-Budget Movies, does just what the title suggests. I spoke to over twenty top screenwriters who had previously worked on low-budget films and got their secrets on how to write for a tiny budget. Interviewees included George Romero, Tom DiCillo, Stuart Gordon, Bob Clark and Kenneth Lonnergan, among others. WN: Your films were made on very low budgets. Grown Men cost under $13,000. How did you manage this? : Mr. Gaspard: Well, as soon as you realize that you won't be paying anyone, that cuts your costs significantly. Second, you should write the script to conform to locations and props that you can get for free. Third, you should shoot as quickly as you can -- 12 to 15 pages of script a day is not uncommon. : The main reason to make a movie for such little money is not just to save money -- it's also to help you maintain control of the movie. Without backers breathing down your neck, you can make the movie you want at the pace you want. You may never see that money again -- a high percentage of low-budget movies never see the light of day, let along turn a profit -- but the satisfaction of making the movie YOU wanted to make greatly outweighs the cost. WN: Will you be doing anymore films in the near future? : Mr. Gaspard: We're mulling over some script ideas, but currently don't have anything we're dying to do. WN: Do you have any advice for the amateur filmmakers reading this? : Mr. Gaspard: See as many movies as you can -- low-budget independent films, Hollywood films, classic movies from the Golden Era. You can learn something valuable from every movie you watch, so the more you see the more you learn. : Read scripts to learn how to write one. And I mean real scripts, not transcriptions of finished movies. Learn what the words look like on the page and how that gets translated into images on the screen. : And, most important, don't ever try to fund your movie with credit cards. Don't believe what you read about other filmmakers doing this -- it flat out doesn't work. : Happy filmmaking!"
entertainment,"Obituaries Irvin Kershner, director of the second Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back, died Saturday at his home in Los Angeles, California aged 87; this followed a three-and-a-half year battle with lung cancer. The announcement of his death was made Monday, by his god-daughter, Adriana Santini. source=George Lucas, on Irvin Kershner His previous credits, working as a photographer and musician, included A fine madness and Eyes of Laura Mars, the latter of these being the inspiration for the creator of the Star Wars movies, George Lucas, to offer him the director's role for The Empire Strikes Back &amp;mdash; something which he initially refused, only to be later persuaded because Lucas felt his attention to the development of characters was important. Lucas later admitted he hadn't wanted to direct the sequel himself. Speaking of the director, Lucas said: ""He knew everything a Hollywood director is supposed to know. ... but was not Hollywood."" He also gained recognition after being nominated for an Emmy, for the 1976 TV Movie Raid on Entebbe, an award which he didn't win, but which thrust him into the spotlight. As a director, Kershner went on to be the driving force behind Sean Connery's return to the role of James Bond, directing Never Say Never Again in 1983. Moving further into the realms of Science Fiction, Kershner directed Robocop 2 in 1990. Kershner was not limited to behind the scenes work; he acted in two films, Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation of Christ, in which he played Zebedee; and, starred as a film director in Stephen Seagal's On Deadly Ground."
entertainment,"At the Siggraph 2005 computer graphics convention in Los Angeles, California Tuesday, Star Wars creator George Lucas unveiled plans for a weekly computer-animated series based on the science fiction saga. The new show, to be called Clone Wars, will be a 3-D animated spinoff of the series and is to be produced in a Lucas facility in Singapore. Lucas already has done limited-run 2-D traditional animated television with Star Wars: Clone Wars shorts on the U.S. cable channel, Cartoon Network. Lucas said advances in digital technology allow an animated television series to do what otherwise would be too expensive."
entertainment,"On Tuesday, the 2011 BRIT Awards were presented from The O2 Arena in London, England. This is the first time that the awards ceremony has been hosted from this venue; previously, the regular location for the show was the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, which is also located in London. The BRIT Awards, presented by the British Phonographic Industry, is an annual ceremony that awards music artists for excellence in music. The BRIT Awards started in 1980; this year's event is the 31st BRIT Awards. ITV1 broadcasted this year's programme from 2000-2200 UTC, with British actor and presenter James Corden hosting it. The ITV1 programme contained performances from various artists, many of which had been nominated for BRIT Awards. The performers and the performances are displayed below but are not in chronological order. They are as follows: *Take That &amp;ndash; Kidz *Adele &amp;ndash; Someone Like You *Rihanna &amp;ndash; Only Girl (In the World) / S&amp;M / What's My Name? *Mumford &amp; Sons &amp;ndash; Timshel *Plan B &amp;ndash; She Said / Prayin' *Tinie Tempah, Eric Turner and Labrinth &amp;ndash; Written in the Stars / Miami 2 Ibiza / Pass Out *Arcade Fire &amp;ndash; Ready To Start *Cee Lo Green and Paloma Faith &amp;ndash; Forget You British rapper Tinie Tempah was nominated for most awards than any other artist, with 'Best British Album' and 'Best British Male' included amongst his four nominations. He was given two BRIT awards - one for 'Best British Single', which was Pass Out, and the second for 'Best British Breakthrough Act'. Upon receiving what would turn out to be his first award of two, Tinie Tempah proclaimed: ""I want to big up God and my family for sticking by me when times are hard."" Canadian indie rock group Arcade Fire were also successful in achieving two BRIT Awards, one for 'Best International Group' and the other for 'Best International Album'; their album is entitled The Suburbs. Dermot O'Leary presented an award to British pop group Take That for 'Best British Group', the first time the group have ever achieved such an award. While the group received the award, member Mark Owen looked at Robbie Williams, who had recently rejoined Take That, and said: ""Can I say thanks for coming back mate. Appreciate it. It's a real pleasure for the five of us to be up here."" The group had a second nomination for 'Best British Album' but were unsuccessful in winning the award. Cee Lo Green, a member of the group Gnarls Barkley, received one BRIT Award for 'Best International Male'. In his acceptance speech, he commented: ""I'm so excited. Thank you so much for this honour. Such a pleasant surprise."" Cee Lo was also nominated for 'Best International Album' but failed to achieve the award. Roger Daltrey, lead singer of English rock group The Who, humourously commented that ""it's good to see the British music industry still has enough money for a good booze up"" before giving the award for 'Best British Album' to Mumford &amp; Sons for their album, entitled Sigh No More. Marcus Mumford, of the group, said that ""this is very bizarre, very strange. Thank you very much indeed. We are very honoured, very humbled."" Mark Ronson and Ellie Goulding awarded the 'Critics' Choice' to English singer-songwriter Jessie J. Backstage, Jessie J - who is currently at number one in the UK Singles Chart with her song Price Tag, featuring American rapper B.o.B - remarked that ""pop stands for popular. I want to be a pop icon and take Britain across the world."" Plan B, another British rapper, achieved the award for 'Best British Male'. ""There's a lot of people I could be thanking right now, I wanna thank them all together,"" he said during his acceptance speech. Having expressed thanks to various family members, friends, his record labels and the people he had worked with, he concluded his speech with the line: ""Thank you, everybody. That's all."" Do you think that the awards were given to the right acts? Earlier in February 2011, Markus Dravs was given the BRIT Award for 'Best British Producer' by Chris Martin, a member of the group Coldplay; Dravs is co-producing a fifth album for the group at present. Dravs was nominated for his work in relation to Arcade Fire album The Suburbs and Mumford &amp; Sons album Sigh No More. ""You could hear it in the lyrics and in the commitment in the demos,"" he commented. ""I really wanted to get involved and see if I could help make the record."" During the BRIT Awards programme on Tuesday, Cheryl Cole presented the 'Best International Female', which was won by Rihanna. The Barbadian pop and R&amp;B singer exclaimed during her acceptance speech: ""Britain, I love you! This is so exciting. I want to thank everybody at my label, Mercury ... all my fans here. You guys are the best! I love you so much. This is...this is big. It doesn't get much bigger than the BRITs, so I love you guys. Thank you so much. This means a lot. I'm the only girl in the world!"" The award for 'Best International Breakthrough Act' was given to Justin Bieber, a Canadian pop music / R&amp;B singer. Upon accepting the award, Bieber commented: ""I want to thank all my fans over here. You guys are amazing. I want to thank the label over here"". Laura Marling was subsequently awarded 'Best British Female'. After being presented with the award by Boy George, Marling said: ""Thank you. My name's Laura and there you go, mum. That's for you and thank you very much to Adam and Laura and everyone at Virgin. This is really weird."" Shortly after the broadcast of the main programme, performances became available to purchase via iTunes. The The BRIT Trust will receive all of the downloads' profits as a donation.

As the winning act of the show, Spelbound have won £100,000 (US$144,580, €120,313, A$175,079) and a place at The Royal Variety Performance, an annual gala evening that is attended by senior members of the British Royal Family. In no particular order, the top three acts were revealed to be two dancers known by their stage name of Twist and Pulse, gymnastic group Spelbound and Kieran Gaffney, whose act involves playing on the drum kit. After Kieran Gaffney was revealed to be in third place, Anthony McPartlin, who hosts Britain's Got Talent with Declan Donnelly, said to Kieran: ""Well done Kieran. Kieran, you're a star, you came back, you got all the way to the final. I know you've loved this. You've loved this, haven't you?"" In response to this, Kieran Gaffney stated: ""Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone for supporting me. Thank you."" Shortly afterwards, on the episode that was broadcast live on ITV1 on Saturday, Anthony announced: ""After tens of thousands of auditons, five semi-finals and an amazing final, this...this is it. One of you is about to walk away with £100,000 and a place at this year's Royal Variety Performance. The winner of Britain's Got Talent 2010 is...Spelbound!"" Glen Murphy from Twist and Pulse commented about finishing in second place, stating: ""Yeah, it's amazing. I can't even believe it. I can't believe it at all."" Alex Uttley, a 24-year-old member of Spelbound, commented on the gymnastic group's victory, commenting: ""Oh, my god. This is unbelieveable. We just want to say thank you to everyone out there. It just shows that all our hard work has paid off."" One of the coaches of Spelbound, named Neil Griffiths, stated about Spelbound: ""Oh, they've worked so hard over the last few weeks. Um, since the semi-final, we...we really had to pull out the stops to try and up the game. They've not known they've worked in the gym from six in the morning till twelve...twelve o'clock of the night. I couldn't have asked for more. Um, it's a team of coaches. I don't take all the credit myself. There's, uh, two people up there that know who they are who've been fantastic."" Spelbound consists of 24-year-old Alex Uttley, Nicholas Illingworth, aged 24, Adam Buckingham, aged 21, 20-year-old Adam McAssey, 19-year-old Douglas Fordyce, 18-year-old Edward Upcott, 18-year-old Leighanne Cowler, 17-year-old Katie Axten, 17-year-old Lauren Kemp, 15-year-old Jonathan Stranks, Abigail Ralph, aged 15, 13-year-old Hollianne Wood and Amy Mackenzie, aged 12. Bookmakers had previously predicted that Spelbound would be the most likely act to become the winner of the series. The running order for the final started with Twist and Pulse. The second act to perform was Liam McNally, a 14-year-old singer. The running order subsequently continued with 40-year-old impressionist Paul Burling, singer Christopher Stone, aged 28, Tina &amp; Chandi, a woman and dog dancing act, Connected, a five-piece singing group, Kieran Gaffney, aged 12, 22-year-old Tobias Mead, a dancer, 80-year-old singer Janey Cutler and Spelbound in that particular order. Earlier on in the final, Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has stated to Spelbound: ""We are hosting the 2012 Olympics and I think 'what a brilliant opening act'."" Fellow judge Piers Morgan also commented that ""the purpose of this show is to identify hidden great British talent. You are that act."" After Spelbound won in the final, another judge, named Simon Cowell, stated that ""the right boys and girls won on the night"" and that he could ""only say on live TV that that was one of the most astonishing things I have ever seen. Seriously."""
entertainment,"At the end of January, Bach Technology announced their new music file format, MusicDNA, which was developed as an intended replacement for the mp3 format, which has been the dominant format in music since its inception. MusicDNA uses similar compression methods to mp3, but then also adds an xml file which defines other content that can be included. Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas caught up with Bach Technology CEO Stefan Kohlmeyer to find out more. WikinewsThank you for agreeing to answer our questions. WNCan you briefly explain what MusicDNA is? Stefan KohlmeyerWe believe that MusicDNA is the successor to the MP3, the MusicDNA media extension enables music fans to access from one application the wide range of music-related content they want alongside the music itself - from lyrics, artwork and tour dates to blog posts, videos and twitter feeds. In addition to all this extra content, MusicDNA files are also intelligent, and include extensive audio analysis information for each single track. This means that search and recommendation tools or automatic playlist generators will be much more sophisticated and provide much better results. WNHow long has it been in development and what role has Karlheinz Brandenburg, the man credited with inventing mp3, played in that? SKIn essence MusicDNA in its current context has been in development since the start of the company in 2007. Bach has an important strategic partnership with Fraunhofer IDMT with its CEO Karlheinz Brandenburg who is an important person for us in all research projects and visionary discussions about the development of the music market. WN Is this just going to be another consumer hurting format war with iTunes LP? What makes MusicDNA better than iTunes LP? SKUnlike iTunes LP, MusicDNA files have been built on open standards and are completely platform agnostic, which means that, unlike iTunes LP, you’re not tied to one device or media player. So it’s about the opposite of format wars really. Whilst LP goes some way to adding value to digital music, it is still essentially a static file with some extra content bolted on. MusicDNA not only gives back all the things we lost when we switched to digital formats, lyrics, liner notes, artwork, but crucially it goes beyond that allowing fans to access everything from Twitter feeds and videos through to concert tickets, this will all dynamically update whenever you're online, so music fans always have the latest information to hand. Importantly with MusicDNA you can customise single tracks, you’re not restricted to purchasing complete albums as you are with LP. And because all the additional rich media is integrated into the file (unlike iTunes LP), that content can be easily transferred from one device to another. Mark Mulligan, vice president and research director of industry analysts Forrester Research recently put it well to the UK’s Telegraph newspaper ""innovations like the iTunes LP need to go further. People should pay just once to get everything that artist does over the next year in one file that is regularly updated."" WNIs this really what listeners want-more clutter to distract from the music itself? What's wrong with mp3? source=Stefan Kohlmeyer SKA lot of people, especially those who grew up buying music on vinyl and CD, miss the packaging, the liner notes, all the things that went hand in hand with albums, so for them that ‘clutter’ is an important part of the experience. We developed MusicDNA based on how people interact with their favourite music and musicians today, so we’re just following the public’s lead in many ways. MusicDNA enables fans to stay constantly connected with the worlds of their favourite artists in a really convenient way. Importantly, MusicDNA files can be customised so that they contain as little or much extra content as the listener wants. You have to remember the MP3 was developed over twenty years ago, think of how much has changed in that time. It has had a profound effect on the music industry, but beyond portability it doesn't actually add anything to the experience, the opposite in fact. WNWill MusicDNA be any less susceptible to piracy than other formats? Do you think MusicDNA has a future? Will it replace mp3? SKAs only paid for files will dynamically update MusicDNA should be an incentive for people to purchase legitimate files rather than downloading them from p2p networks. Over the last decade a lot of effort has gone into trying to stop piracy through sanctions and enforcement, and, well, the results speak for themselves. We believe in a carrot approach, giving the public what they actually want and a great incentive to go the legit route. WNMany people argue that music is moving away from being owned and more towards models like Spotify; free, streamed music. Is MusicDNA not too late to the party if this is so? SKLike many in the industry Bach are of the view that there is no one silver bullet to suit all types of consumer, rather a variety of services will serve different fans with different needs. There are many occasions when a download is preferable to a stream, and MusicDNA files have the advantage of customised, at your fingertips, rich media available on- and offline. And that is before considering the impact of streaming on growing bandwidth and energy requirements. WNSo when will we start to see MusicDNA and where? SKRollout will be staggered over 2010, with the first beta versions available around Easter and the full commercial rollout expected over summer. WNAnd finally, your favourite artist at the moment to be released on MusicDNA this year? SKIt's too early to say, but we're in talks with some very exciting artists. I would love to see all my old heroes on MusicDNA, starting with Led Zeppelin and The Clash. WNThank you again for your time. Good luck with the launch."
entertainment,"A local Swiss government has shown some bare cheek and has taken action, after hordes of German naked hikers rambling across the Swiss alps au naturel, caused indignation amongst locals. Authorities in Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden have warned that starting from February 9, the government will impose hefty fines of 200 Swiss Francs (£122, €135) on naturists found walking or hiking in the nude without clothes in the picturesque mountains because of a recent influx of visiting German nudists. The new ordinance is expected to be passed this spring. If it is approved by the local parliament on February 9 it should be effective on April 26. The Swiss canton aims to stop spread of 'indecent practice' by minimally-clad German climbers. The problem started with a group of ""boot-only hikers"" who were stopped by the police in the Alpine region last autumn. They had wandered there regularly, proudly marching through nature with bare bums, and had also advertised what they thought was a naked paradise on the internet. But it was all too much for the Swiss. A nude rambler dressed in nothing more than a rucksack and walking boots in the eastern Appenzell region was arrested and detained in the canton, but authorities were unable to file lawsuit because the act was not punished by law or ordinance at the time. ""We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts,"" Melchior Looser, the canton’s justice and police minister, said. “Ultimately, in the summer lots of kids stay in our mountains,” he added. In the guidelines imposed, arrested offenders who cannot pay the fine, will face legal action. The new enabling ordinance has, however, been met with protests by nude hikers. ""We simply try to tune into nature. It's the most harmless pursuit possible,"" said Dietmar, age 58, a German lawyer. German tabloid Bild Zeitung has editorially attacked Swiss intolerance and even suggested nudist alternatives worldwide, after hinting a Swiss tourism boycott. Local authorities of Harz mountain range in central Germany have also announced the openness to any visitor of an “official naked walking route” in nature's outdoors. Freikörperkultur (""FKK""), or ""free body culture"", is a popular pastime in Germany. It is a German movement which endorses a naturistic approach to sports and community living. Behind that is the joy of the experience of nature or also on being nude itself, without direct relationship to sexuality. The followers of this culture are called traditional naturists, FKK'ler, or nudists. The naked ramblers have hoped it doesn't lead to another naturist-clothed 'war', like the one at a beach between German and Polish holidaymakers in 2008. Naturism has roots traced from the start of the 20th century. ""Abandoning unpractical clothes enables a direct contact with the wind, sun and temperature"", naked hiker website nacktwandern.de stated. But Markus Dörig, a spokesman for Appenzell Innerrhoden canton has defended the law, explaining that the “public nuisance” was a foreign import. “We have been receiving many complaints. The local people are upset and we in the government share their concern. How would one feel if one was to go walking in nature and suddenly came across a group of naked people? They are definitely not people from the area, and I think many of them come from Germany,” he noted. “We are a small and orderly community and such things are simply out of place here. Perhaps in vast mountain areas naked people would not be much of a problem but here they simply stick out,” Dörig added. ""I can understand that we all have to live in this world together,"" said Barbara Foley, International Naturist Foundation member of the central committee. ""But I would certainly enjoy doing the hike in the nude and I wouldn't want to be deprived of it. It's nice to feel the sun on your skin. Maybe they should designate a couple of trails and people would know they might come across naturists there,"" she added. Appenzell Innerrhoden (Appenzell Inner Rhodes) is the smallest canton of Switzerland by population and the second smallest by area, Basel-City having less area. The population of the canton was 15,471 as of 2007, of which 1,510 (or 9.76%) were foreigners. The canton in the north east of Switzerland has an area is 173&amp;nbsp;km². It was divided in 1597 for religious reasons from the former canton Appenzell, with Appenzell Ausserrhoden being the other half. Appenzell is the capital of this canton. The constitution was established in 1872. Most of the canton is pastoral, this despite being mountainous. Cattle breeding and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities: Appenzeller cheese is widely available throughout Switzerland. Due to the split of Appenzell along religious lines, the population (as of 2000) is nearly all Roman Catholic (81%), with a small Protestant minority (10%). The town, however is far from liberalism: the canton granted women the right of suffrage only in 1990 under pressure from the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and international human rights groups. The Alpine village of Appenzell Innerrhoden, being known for its beautiful landscape, has recently been declared a ""naked rambler paradise"" by a German mountaineering website, which was created by a lobby group of hikers."
entertainment,"Internet The news of the death of Michael Jackson yesterday caused problems for web sites and caused hoax reports of other celebrity deaths to be posted. Twitter, where several celebrities immediately posted their comments on the news, saw its update frequency double as soon as the news broke. Facebook's update frequency tripled. Temporary server outages were reported for Twitter, TMZ.com (the site that originally broke the story), and the web site of the Los Angeles Times. On Wikinews, the report of Jackson's death received 1,150 page hits in its first hour of publication, almost 9 times as much as the number of page hits received by Wikinews' second most popular story that hour. At its peak, the Wikinews story received 4,466 page hits in one hour. On Wikipedia, an edit war ensued when users repeatedly deleted references while reports of his death remained unverified. Once a credible source, the Los Angeles Times, verified the story, Wikipedia published the news. Hoax stories sparked by news of Jackson's death included false reports of the deaths of Jeff Goldblum and Harrison Ford. These stories were rapidly revealed to be hoaxes, but some news outlets carried the stories by mistake. The entertainment report on Nine Network's Today show, for example, mistakenly carried the story of Goldblum's death. Goldblum was in fact alive and well in Los Angeles, California, according to an official statement issued by his publicist. The hoaxes originated on a web site that generates superficially genuine but false news reports from pre-set formulae, into which the celebrity name of one's choice can be entered. One of the options available is for the report to state that the celebrity ""dies in New Zealand"" at Kauri Cliffs near Matauri Bay. Because of this, many people attempted to contact New Zealand police, forcing Inspector Kerry Watson of the NZ police to issue the following statement: :""Police at Kerikeri are receiving phone calls regarding a person falling from a cliff at Kauri Cliff. There is no such incident and police have no information to provide."" This is not the first time that this particular hoax has circulated. The exact same story, with the same cliffs, circulated about Tom Hanks in 2006 and about Tom Cruise in 2008. Cruise's publicist, Jeff Raymond, stated at the time that the story was ""erroneous and unreliable Internet garbage""."
entertainment,"Music Taylor Swift's Evermore album has returned to the top position on the Billboard 200 chart this week, after an 8307% increase in sales. Evermore, which was released in December, only had its vinyl edition issued on May 28, although preorders were available from the moment of the album's release. In the week ending on June 3, Evermore sold 192 thousand copies, setting the record for the biggest sales week of the year. Billboard credited the rise of Evermore back to No. 1 to a number of factors, including ""modern-era record-breaking vinyl LP sales &amp;mdash; 102 thousand &amp;mdash; Swift-signed CDs and deep discounting on its digital album"". The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums in the United States on a weekly basis, combining album sales and streaming. source=Taylor Swift, on Evermore returning to No. 1 In this week's chart, Evermore jumped from 74 to 1, marking the biggest jump to the number 1 position since Radiohead's In Rainbows went from 156 to 1. Since then, three albums have also re-entered the chart at no. 1, the most recent of which was Bon Jovi's This House Is Not for Sale on the March 10, 2018 chart, caused by a bundling of concert tickets with the album. Evermore broke the record for the biggest sales week for a vinyl album, having initially sold over 40 thousand copies from May 28 to May 31 to edge out the previous record holder, Jack White's Lazaretto. By the end of the week, Evermore had sold 102 thousand vinyl copies. The delay of Evermores vinyl release is due to the length of time vinyl records take to produce. As Evermore was only announced a day before its release, it is likely that there was not sufficient time before its release to complete the production of physical editions of the album, including vinyl editions. In other countries where Evermore hit no. 1 upon its December release, it also recieved a boost. On the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart Top 100, Evermore jumped 70 spots to the no. 4 position. Australia's ARIA Top 50 Albums chart saw Evermore go up nine spots to no. 38. In New Zealand, Evermore was one of the fastest rising titles on the Official Top 40 Albums chart, re-entering at no. 30."
entertainment,"Education On Saturday, Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Chicago issued diplomas which misspelled the word integrated in ""Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications"". Around 30 diplomas out of 250 distributed contained the spelling error, ""itegrated"". In an e-mail quoted by Chicago Tribune, department lecturer Desiree Hanford said, ""The diplomas are issued by the university, so we will work with the university registrar's office Monday to provide new diplomas to these students"". Inside Higher Ed said some alumni had objected to the program's name change several years ago, and found the current situation amusing given their opposition to including integrated in the program's name. The journalism program has a grading policy called the ""Medill F"", where assignments that contain an error such as having a spelling error result in the assignment being failed. Graduating student Kit Fox, according to the Chicago Tribune, said of the Medill F, ""When as a freshman you hear about it for the first time, it sounds extremely harsh. It sounds almost unfair...And then you look at the stakes of what journalism is, and you realize it's much more forgiving than what happens in the real world."" He also told FOX 32 News, ""Maybe it was just one last edit test for us grads, or just some fantastic irony""."
entertainment,"The family and friends of the world-famous opera singer Luciano Pavarotti have gathered in his hometown of Modena, Italy to pay their final respects. Pavarotti died on Thursday of complication from pancreatic cancer at the age of 71. The Roman Catholic service at the cathedral in Modena was attended by such international stars as fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras, as well as U2's Bono. It included Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus, Giuseppe Verdi's Ave Maria and a message of condolence from Pope Benedict XVI, who said Pavarotti had ""honored the divine gift of music through his extraordinary interpretative talent"". At least 800 people were present in the cathedral, but thousands gathered outside to watch the service on a television screen placed in Modena's main square. The service was also shown on Italian state television and via the Internet. A recording of Pavarotti's famous duet with his father in 1978 was played and prompted a standing ovation of the crowd inside and outside the cathedral, and Italy's air force gave a flyover releasing smoke in the colours of the Italian flag. It is estimated that over 100,000 people have seen Pavarotti's casket in the past two days, where it has been publicly displayed in Modena's main piazza, to many of Pavarotti's recordings and appearances shown on the public screen. Pavarotti will be buried in his family plot in a private ceremony at the Montale Rangone cemetery near Modena."

The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time."" He also reported that Michael had died of heart failure and ""passed away peacefully"". Sir Elton John said via Instagram, ""I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend &amp;mdash; the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans."" George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in London. Over his multi-decade career, he sold more than 100 million records. Along with co-singer Andrew Ridgeley he became famous as part of the duo band Wham!. Together, Michael and Ridgeley produced several hit songs, such as Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Freedom, and Last Christmas. In 1985, Wham! was the first Western band to play in China since the beginning of the country's opening up strategy. Wham! dissolved in 1986. In 1984, Michael recorded the successful single Careless Whisper. Michael was credited as the solo artist in the United Kingdom and as ""Wham! featuring George Michael"" in the United States. Michael released a hit solo album Faith in 1987, containing hits like I Want Your Sex. Michael's life was troubled by both substance abuse and issues with his sexuality. He initially hid his identity as a gay man from his fans, coming out only after a very public arrest for public lewdness in 1998. He would later be arrested for possession of drugs and driving under the influence of drugs. He was sentenced to eight weeks in prison in 2010 for crashing a Range Rover into a storefront while under the influence of drugs and possession of cannabis. Michael had a history of transforming his negative experiences into art. He wrote White Light about a serious case of pneumonia that led to his hospitalization in 2011, and the music video for Outside, which followed on the heels of his arrest and coming out, showed scenes of a men's bathroom, a dance club, and men kissing while in police uniforms. He would perform White Light live at the 2012 London Olympics."

The competition was held in Palace of Sports in downtown Kiev, Ukraine, after its entry, Ruslana, had won the 2004 contest singing Wild Dances. Semi-finals had been held on May 19, 2005. 10 out of 25 countries with the highest scores in the semi-finals then joined 14 already pre-qualified countries in the final. Both events were televised across Europe. More than 6000 spectators attended the event. Organisers hope that it will boost Ukraine's image abroad and increase tourism, while the country's new government hopes that it will also give a modest boost to the long-term goal of acquiring European Union membership. Bulgaria and Moldova took part for the first time while Hungary returned after a hiatus since 1998. Lebanon had been expected to make its debut appearance but decided to withdraw. For the first time in the history of the contest, Ireland failed to qualify. The hosts for the event were Maria ""Masha"" Efrosinina and DJ Pasha, a TV Presenter and Radio DJ. Finally, it's important to note most countries now choose to sing in English rather than their native language, since rule changes permit the singer to perform in any language they want. It is interesting to note that Spain, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, who all automatically qualify for the final by right of paying the bulk of the budget of the European Broadcasting Union (Eurovision's parent organisation) all finished in the bottom four positions."

entertainment,"The 78th Academy Awards were hosted by Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show. Crash won the Best Picture award, a surprise for many predictors. Co-producer Cathy Schulman commented ""thank you for embracing our film, about love and about tolerance, about truth. Thank you to the people all around the world who have been touched by this message. And we are humbled by the other nominees in this category. You have made this year one of the most breathtaking, and stunning, maverick years in American cinema, thank you."" Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco also won best original screenplay for Crash. Directed and co-produced by Canadian Paul Haggis, film distribution rights were purchased for just USD$3 million by Lions Gate Films. Noted film critic Roger Ebert called it his favourite picture of 2005, and the picture made many North American ""10 best"" lists. Backstage, Best Director winner Ang Lee commented to the press on how Brokeback Mountain refreshed his will to direct. ""Before I get into making this movie, I was very tired from two very ambitious work, The Hulk and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I almost wanted to retire. I felt I had enough, I hit the bottom, sort of like my mid life crisis or something, and this movie teach me how to look at myself, how to manage myself in movie making again, enjoying making them, and the movie was shot very simple, nothing special, but most important, it taught me again, it's about human emotions, drama and acting."" Foreign Language Film winner Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) commented that he felt the Oscar win would ""change the way South Africans view their moviemaking... hopefully it means that people will keep investing in our local stories, because this gives investors a little more confidence and what we want more than anything else is that people and human emotion is universal and we're more alike than we think we are around the world... we're actually so similar as human beings inside."" Tsotsi was the People's Choice Award winner at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, while Crash debuted at the fest in 2004. Capote and Brokeback Mountain both played at the festival days after debuting at the Telluride Film Festival. TIFF's winners often go on to win Best Picture or Best Foreign Language Film; Wo hu cang long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), American Beauty, and Whale Rider are such examples. Stewart's humor fell short of expectation for most North American film and television critics who commented on the broadcast. At one point, Stewart jokingly chastised Hollywood for being ""out of touch"" with mainstream American values. Actor George Clooney later responded to this notion, saying, ""We are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood. It’s probably a good thing. We’re the ones that talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered. And we talked about civil rights when it wasn’t really popular. We bring up subjects. This group of people gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters. I’m proud of this Academy, of this community.

entertainment,"GermanyA stampede at the entrance of a German music festival, the Love Parade, today killed nineteen people and injured around a hundred more. The incident apparently took place due to overcrowding at the entrance to the grounds of the event, located in Duisburg, Germany, which more than a million people were reported to have attended. Despite warnings by police of overcrowding, more people tried to enter the grounds. There is speculation that the panic may have begun when people fell after trying to cross a barrier, and subsequently spread. Witness Udo Sandhoefer said that people ""climbed up the walls and tried somehow to get into the grounds from the side, and the people in the crowd that moved up simply ran over those who were lying on the ground."" Emergency responders apparently encountered difficulties in reaching those in need of assistance due to the number of people in the area. Officials also decided not to evacuate the grounds of the event, citing concerns that a larger panic would be sparked if more people knew of the deaths. A woman attending the event said that ""there were piles of injured on the ground, some being resuscitated, others dead and covered with sheets. It was way too full in the afternoon, everybody wanted to get in."" A statement from president Christian Wulff said that ""it is terrible that such a catastrophe brought death, suffering and pain to a peaceful festival full of happy young people from many countries."" The mayor of Duisburg, Adolf Sauerland, said that security measures at the event were sufficient, and that an investigation into the incident was already under way."

entertainment,"Symphonic power metal band Nightwish have released Dark Passion Play, the album with the highest production costs in the history of the band's native Finland. When drummer Jukka Nevalainen was asked the overall cost of the new album, he was quoted as saying “Roughly half a million... We don’t know the exact sum down to the euros and cents as yet.” Half of this cost was incurred in London, United Kingdom, over an expensive eight days at the Abbey Road Studios, during which time the London Session Orchestra, the Metro Voices Choir, a gospel choir, and two Irish musicians recorded their parts at the studio. The rest was spent during the ten months between September 2006 and June this year, when the band were recording the rest of the album in Finland. The album is the sixth full-length studio album by the band, and sports some impressive figures, boasting the contributions of almost 130 different musicians and requiring a total of almost 250 separate recording tracks. Nightwish is paying for the album via the company Scene Nation, who are entirely owned by Nightwish, and have sold the license for it to Nuclear Blast Records. The album is the first to feature new vocalist Anette Olzon, who earlier this year replaced Tarja Turunen, the latter having departed the band in 2005. The album went platinum (sold more than 30,000 copies) within hours of its Finnish release date of September 26, with 42,000 copies sold. Nightwish are currently rehearsing for a world tour to promote the album."
entertainment,"FilmThe release of the movie Avatar, written and directed by James Cameron, has generated increased interest in the field of constructed language, also known as conlang. Cameron asked American linguistics professor Paul Frommer to develop a language spoken by the extraterrestrial people in the film known as the Na'vi. Author J. R. R. Tolkien developed Elvish languages for his literary series The Lord of the Rings. The Elvish language was featured in scenes of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson. The Klingon language (tlhIngan Hol) was developed by linguist Marc Okrand, initially for use in the 1984 film Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Okrand drew inspiration from Klingon lines spoken by actor James Doohan in the film Star Trek: The Motion Picture; Doohan portrayed character Montgomery Scott in the Star Trek series. A dictionary for Klingon developed by Okrand, The Klingon Dictionary sold over 300,000 copies. National Public Radio on Klenginem Klingon became quite popular and has developed a usage among Star Trek fans. The Klingon Terran Research Ensemble in the Netherlands created an opera in Klingon. The play Hamlet by William Shakespeare was translated into Klingon. A German Trekkie who goes by the moniker Klenginem posted videos to YouTube where he raps songs he translated into Klingon by musician Eminem. Klenginem has been cited recently in pieces on constructed language in The New York Times, ABC News Nightline, and National Public Radio. ""You know your alien language has taken off when a German guy translates rap songs into it,"" said National Public Radio of Klenginem. Linguistics professor Frommer received his PhD degree from the University of Southern California (USC), and subsequently shifted his focus into the business arena. He returned to USC to teach at the Marshall School of Business. Cameron tasked Frommer with creating an entire language for the Na'vi people. In an interview with Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times, Frommer voiced hope that the language would continue to be used separate from the movie, as Klingon has. ""I'm still working and I hope that the language will have a life of its own,"" said Frommer. The Na'vi language created by Frommer contains over 1,000 words, as well as a structural system and rules format for usage. Frommer told Vanity Fair that the language was fairly developed, commenting, ""It’s got a perfectly consistent sound system, and grammar, orthography, syntax"". Paul Frommer Frommer explained the direction given to him before creating the language, ""Cameron wanted something melodious and musical, something that would sound strange and alien but smooth and appealing."" The Avatar writer-director provided Frommer with approximately three dozen words of the Na'vi language he used in his scriptment for the film. ""That was the starting point. Probably the most exotic thing I added were ejectives, which are these sorts of popping sounds that are found in different languages from around the world. It's found in Native American languages and in parts of Africa and in Central Asia, the Caucasus,"" explained Frommer. Cameron and Frommer worked together for four years developing the language. The linguistics professor relied on inspiration provided by Cameron, and avoided drawing upon influences from Elvish, Klingon, and the international auxiliary language Esperanto. Sample words in the Na'vi language include ""Uniltìrantokx"" (oo-neel-tih-RAHN-tokx), meaning ""Avatar"", and ""tireaioang"" (tee-REH-ah-ee-o-ahng), which means ""spirit animal"". Maclean's reported that fans of Avatar were anxious for more instructive material from professor Frommer about the language in order to learn how to speak it with others that appreciated the film. ""The response has been quite remarkable and totally unexpected. I never thought there’d be this level of interest. But I really don’t think of Na’vi as a competitor to Klingon. If it does develop a following, that would be quite wonderful,"" said Frommer of the response to the language from Avatar fans. James Cameron The Na'vi language is itself a minor plot point in the film Avatar. The character Jake Sully portrayed by Sam Worthington endeavors to learn the language while living on Pandora. A botanist portrayed by actress Sigourney Weaver instructs a scientist played by actor Joel David Moore on how to become conversational in the language. Zoe Saldaña, the actress behind warrior princess Neytiri in Avatar, picked up the Na'vi language faster than her fellow cast members. ""Zoe owned the language and everyone had to match her, even her accent,"" said Cameron. Saldaña remarked that the most difficult part about acting in the film was speaking in English with the accent of the Na'vi people. Cameron touted the rich nature of the Na'vi language in publicity for his film. ""We wanted to 'out-Klingon' Klingon. The best sci-fi movies immerse the audience in that world until it doesn't seem alien to them,"" said Cameron to USA Today. HYS"

entertainment,"Australia Australia’s Nine Network has issued an apology after the rival Seven Network caught Nine News fabricating live crosses to the search site for murdered schoolboy Daniel Morcombe. The network issued a statement after Saturday and Sunday’s Nine News bulletins in Brisbane, which featured presenter Eva Milic crossing “live” to the site with the caption: “Near Beerwah”. The rival Seven Network, based nearby, lifted the lid on the scam after filming the Nine News chopper almost 100 kilometres south of Beerwah – on the helipad outside the studio, with lights on and blades in motion while Cameron Price reported from inside. Nine admitted to faking Sunday’s cross; issuing a statement on Monday blaming bad weather. “Our chopper was forced to divert from Beerwah due to bad weather, and air control instructed them to touch down,” it read. The network also told media industry website mUmBRELLA that “the producer was unaware until it was too late to abort or delay the cross”. Doubts have been cast over the truth of this statement, however, as it has since emerged that the chopper was also absent from Beerwah on Saturday, and was in fact circling Brisbane’s western suburbs during Melissa Mallet’s report. Director of Queensland Seven News, Rob Raschke, questioned the merit of Nine’s claims, telling Brisbane’s Courier-Mail, “the idea of not knowing where a $3 million helicopter is defies belief”. A revised statement yesterday announced a Nine investigation into why the location of the helicopter was misreported on both nights, describing the situation as “unacceptable”."

entertainment,"The English Football Association (FA) has complained after broadcaster ITV cut away to an advertisement just before a winning goal in a match. The match, an FA Cup Merseyside derby between Everton F.C. and Liverpool F.C., was in extra time after 118 minutes without a goal when ITV's automated advertisement server, designed for use only during ordinary programming, began playing out commercials. During this time, Everton's Dan Gosling scored the winning goal. In some regions the system returned to the match just before the goal, but viewers in the south of England saw only the celebrations after the goal. Michael Grade, executive chairman of ITV, admitted to ITN that the broadcast had been a shambles and said that ""yellow or red cards"" would go to those responsible once it was established how it happened.

The campaign for the new TenderCrisp chicken burger received two complaints over the fact that the burger appears significantly larger on the advert than in real life. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) investigated the complaints and purchased three burgers from a Burger King restaurant. They reported that both the thickness and the height were ""considerably less"" than in the advertisement. The ASA also commented on the actor, stating, ""we also examined the size of the burgers in the hands of an average-sized man and considered that they did not fill the hands to the same extent as the burger featured in the advert.

entertainment,"USA Chicago, Illinois police arrested William Balfour, the estranged brother-in-law of Oscar-winning American actress and singer Jennifer Hudson, on Monday, multiple media outlets reported. Balfour is expected to be charged with three counts of murder for the slayings of three of Hudson's relatives in October. ""We have obtained an arrest warrant for William Balfour. He was released to Chicago detectives,"" Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Monique Bond told Reuters. Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and brother, Jason Hudson, 29 were found dead in Donerson's home on October 24 and the body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King was found four days later in a stolen SUV. A handgun police say is tied to the case was found nearby, but Reuters reports that Bond did not comment on any evidence in the case. The Associated Press reports that police took Balfour into custody on Oct. 24 and held him for 48 before the Illinois Department of Corrections took possession of him on an alleged parole violation. Balfour previously served nearly seven years for a 1999 conviction attempted murder, vehicular hijacking, and possessing a stolen vehicle. CNN reports he was out of jail on parole at the time of the shootings. Balfour's mother, Michelle Davis-Balfour, spoke to the press Monday night, saying she thought that there was no case against her son. ""If they found gun powder on his hands, you got a case; if they found a gun on him, he had a case; if they found a fingerprint on the truck that he did this, you got a case; but they don't have nothing,"" Davis-Balfour said, according to the Associated Press. She also said: ""My son did not do this. I am sick of this. They need to focus on somebody else."" Davis-Balfour also accused at least one witness of lying while providing an alibi for his son, saying he was with one of three girls friends when the killings happened. ""He was with Diana that night and with Kate in the morning,"" she said, according to CNN. Attorney for Balfour, Josh Kutnick, told CNN that his client is innocent. ""He believes when the evidence comes out, he will be found not guilty,"" Kutnick told CNN. Hudson became famous in 2004 when she was one of the finalists on the third season of the American hit television show American Idol. She later won multiple awards for her role in the 2006 motion picture Dreamgirls."
entertainment,"Called the ""Carrie Bradshaw"" of bloggers by the New York Times, Manhattanite New Yorker Stephanie Klein's online musings in her personal blog, Greek Tragedy, has gained the attention of Hollywood and the book industry while it draws comparisons to former HBO television series, Sex and the City. Since January 2004, Klein has written her blog which goes into the intimate details of her life as a 29-year-old professional divorced single woman living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, one of New York City's most upscale neighborhoods. Since then her blog has become among the top 1 percent most-read blogs in the world, according to Technorati's ""net attention"" ratings system. That popularity grabbed the attention of two international media conglomerates, News Corporation and NBC Universal. News Corp.'s HarperCollins book division struck a book deal with Klein valued at more than $500,000. The book is scheduled to debut in April 2006. Comparisons to Sex and the City may continue, as NBC Universal is developing the blog-based book into a fictionalized weekly sitcom version of Klein’s life for its NBC television network. * Greek Tragedy blog site"
entertainment,"When a fan connects with a band, it's often during moments like a drive down a highway at night reflecting on some aspect of his or her life; sitting at home after a fight with a girlfriend; singing in the shower; or celebrating at a party with her friends. Music becomes a soundtrack to an individual's life, and a connection with the musician forms when the listener is able to peg a perfect moment or feeling to a song. Boston-based mega-member rock group Bang Camaro's fan base claims a different level of interaction: they often have learned to play their music before they ever had a moment associated with it. Bang Camaro found fame on the video game Guitar Hero II, where an aspiring rock god uses a guitar-shaped peripheral to play rock music as notes scroll towards him on the screen. Wikinews reporter David Shankbone journeyed to the Bowery Ballroom to talk to the two founding members of Bang Camaro, Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett. But when MTV.com shows up at the same time as Wikinews to do an interview, the band must split up. Below is our conversation with Necochea about touring, influence, politics, throwing his corpse out of a plane and flatulent women. ---- David Shankbone: How's the tour going? :Alex Necochea: The tours is going great! We just played in Poughkeepsie last night with the OCC house band. DS: Poughkeepsie, huh? :AN: Yeah! Laughs Poughkeepsie, it's kind of a dark town. Not much of a built-in crowd there. DS: What kind of crowd is there? :AN: From what I could tell, we played for a lot of Guitar Hero fans and people who heard about us through friends of friends, or came across us on MySpace. That sort of thing. But for the most part a lot of the kids we meet are anywhere between...well, I guess at a club like that they have to be over 18, but usually they are just much younger kids who are video game fans, who have heard about us through Guitar Hero II. DS: What's that like to have a fan base that comes from primarily video games? Have you noticed a difference between being known as a local band playing in your city and being known through video games? How would you compare the audience? :AN: It's different. In our hometown it started off as just a big word of mouth thing. We had twenty guys in the band, so everybody had friends-of-friends. We started a groundswell that way. But when we get out of town, not in New York so much, but when we go to Chicago and Milwaukee and places like that they generally tend to be much younger people. It's a really big thrill for Bryn and I in that we are meeting kids who are just like us: young video game fans, aspiring musicians, usually males who picked up guitars. They come to us and say, 'Nobody plays guitar anymore like you guys do!' or 'My parents used to listen to music like that!' It's just a big thrill for us to meet young kids like that who remind us of ourselves when we were kids. DS: How does it feel to be looked-up to by the kids, by America's future? :AN: Laughs It's terrifying! Laughs DS: Do you see parents at the show? :AN: Oh, yeah, oh yeah. Parents with their kids— DS: That must reduce the crotch grabbing. :AN: Laughs Yeah, a little bit of macho posturing. I tell you man, it's a really big thrill, just to go out and play in towns we've never been to. Kids come out and they know all the songs. We've had situations where we've played New York and girls are in the front row singing along to our guitar solos. Like, wow...we're on stage playing and we can hear them singing back at us. Something else Bryn and I have noticed is at larger festival shows when we get to the end of our shows we play Push Push Lady Lightning, the kids would just light up and start air guitaring! But not actually playing air guitar, but playing air guitar hero--like, they knew where all the notes were! DS: Which is a lot different for audiences of many bands. :AN: Absolutely! I can't imagine other bands having the same experience, because we come from such a unique perspective that a large part of our music is driven by the instrumentals, and that sort of thing. DS: Your fans are so engaged with your music, far more than most bands have. Most bands they have fans who feel their music speaks to them, but your fans can say, 'I learned to play guitar on your shit and not on Eleanor Rigby!' :AN: It's an honor. It's still unbelievable to me. I had a message from a friend of mine who was at Guitar Center and he heard one of the kids cranking out one of our songs when he was trying out the guitar. To me, it's like we made it. DS: At this point of your career, you're not playing stadiums, but you're also not playing Otto's Tiki Lounge on a Tuesday night. When you reflect upon it, what do you think about? :AN: In the past two years, since Bryn and I started this project, we've both been playing in bands locally in Boston for years. We had some mixed success, we played large venues in and around Boston. We got to the point where we said fuck it, we just want to have some fun and we'd laugh a lot going over old Ozzy Osbourne stuff we listened to as kids, just giggle about it. Bang Camaro started that way, something for us to do and invite our friends to come sing on it. Now, just two years later, it's amazing what happens when you stop trying. It's something not contrived or born of any desire to reach an audience. We just did it for fun, and that spoke to people more than anything else we worked on. DS: Do you have other areas of your life where you've been able to apply that? :AN: Laughs You mean as an ethos? Don't try? Laughs You know, not really. I have found the greatest success in the things I have put most of my effort into. This band has been a complete unique experience in that respect, at least in terms of trying to forge a 'career in music.' Bryn and I had gotten to the point where we thought maybe this wasn't the way to go. Bryn was going to go back to his career as a video game programmer and I was just going to find something else to do. So not really, I don't really apply that in any other portion of my life. DS: What are some dream projects you'd like to work on? :AN: As a musician, obviously for me it would be to meet and work with some heroes of mine since I was a kid. Like Mutt Lang; he always made my favorite records. At the same time, it has also been a dream of mine to meet people like Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse. Those guys made honest sort of rock n' roll, for lack of a better comparison, the way people like John Lennon or Bob Dylan would. To me those are the artists of my generation. It would be my dream one just to meet those guys and two just to work with them on some level. I'd also be lying to say that it would just be my dream to take this project with twenty of my best friends and take it as far as we can take it. So far in my life it's been the most rewarding thing. DS: In the creative process it's so difficult to be original today. Everything has been done. Do you ever let that trip you up, the Simpsons Did It problem? :AN: No, not really. I found I would end up falling into that cycle playing in indie rock bands, just trying to come up with the next thing, like Radiohead they stopped using guitars and things like that. Trying to kick the ball forward a little bit instead of kicking it side to side. With this band we don't get hung up on that. We originally just started it as a celebration of the things we loved when we were kids. We're not out here trying to reinvent the wheel. We're fortunate in that when we were putting the project together we wanted that big vocal sound. What set us apart was how we went about doing that. We just invited all of our friends because we didn't want to multi track everything ourselves. Soon after we had to figure out how to pull it off live, and people would approach and say 'we heard you have this crazy project with all these people.' The project grew into the live monster it is out of necessity. We're not rich people, we don't have refrigerators and the big tour bus. Speaking of dreams, maybe one day we'll have a tour bus. For now, we travel in two very smelly vans. DS: If you could choose your own death, how would you die? :AN: Laughs I would want to steal what I heard a mutual friend of ours said. He said when he died--it's not how he died, but this is what I heard--he said when he's dead, he wants his corpse to be dressed up like Superman and thrown out of an airplane. I thought that would be fitting. But I'm not ready to think about death, not just yet. DS: You guys have been described as Metal and Glam rock. What would you describe your sound as? :AN: I would call us anthem rock. We're really not heavy metal. I think our focus is more on writing great singles, as best as we can make them. Pop music. That's just something Bryn and I grew up on. We're big fans of melody and big driving hooks, that sort of thing. DS: Would you say anthem rock more in the Mötley Crüe vane or more in the T. Rex vane? :AN: I would say half and half. Our influences don't just stop with hair metal and things like that. We draw on things like Thin Lizzy, Boston, bands like that. Not necessarily virtuosic sort of musicianship, but things that are put together. We like to spend the time when we are writing our songs that we are taking all the extraneous crap out of it. We just want to make good, hook-drive pop music. DS: Does the war in Iraq affect you artistically at all? :AN: Laughs No, not at all. No, you could say I'm just like everybody else. I read the paper and blogs, and I'm just as horrified as everybody else. I'm definitely not a fan of this war. DS: If you had to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan, where would you fight? :AN: Oh, the fight was definitely in Afghanistan. Iraq was a much different animal. DS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or things that are man made? :AN: I would probably have to go with nature. I'm a student of science. I have a degree in environmental geology. When I was 19/20 years old I went through all the regular existential questions people that age go through: why am I here and my place in the universe, that sort of thing. DS: Did you answer any of them? :AN: Oh, God! I play rock guitar in a twenty man band! DS: That's important for a lot of people - you see your audience. You're giving a lot of inspiration to a lot of people. You don't know who you might be inspiring to pursue music. :AN: Laughs Oh, kids, don't be like me! I would definitely go with nature over man made. DS: What's your favorite curse word? :AN: Fuck. DS: What's your favorite euphemism for breasts? :AN: Big guns. DS: Have you used that recently? :AN: Actually, I think I did use that in the last week, and no comment. DS: I read that you named the band after fast women and fast cars. :AN: Laughs Who told you that? No, Bang Camaro were two words out of the English language that were the two sexiest words we could think of. We put them together and they roll off the tongue. Bang Camaro. It says a lot more than it means. DS: What sort of qualities do you look for in a woman? :AN: I need a girl who is going to make me laugh. I need a woman who is smarter than I am. A woman who will always keep me guessing. Absolutely. Calling me out for my own jerky bullshit. I like a girl who is fiercely independent, knows what she wants, and doesn't need me. DS: Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama? :AN: Oh, man, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for saying Obama. I would probably go with Obama. There's just something in his rhetoric and his oratory that is a lot more inspiring than Hillary. Hillary, to me, represents not much of a changing of the guard. DS: What would be the greatest of misfortunes to befall you? :AN: Chuckles Oh, if I were to die alone. No, probably one of my greatest fears is injuring or maiming any of my appendages, to be honest. DS: Do you have any special things you do to make sure you don't injure or lose an appendage? :AN: Chuckles I don't keep my hands in my pockets when I am running down stairs. DS: That's a conscious choice? :AN: Yes, that's a conscious choice. DS: What if you are just walking down stairs? :AN: Chuckles You can't realign the stars, man. Shit will happen, shit will happen. DS: What possession do you treasure most? :AN: That's a good question. Probably my cat. I love my cat more than anything. DS: What's your cat's name? :AN: Sadie. DS: Like Sexy Sadie? :AN: Yeah, like Sexy Sadie. That's exactly what I named her after. Big John Lennon fan, so I couldn't resist. DS: What trait do you deplore most in other people? :AN: I'm a lover, not a fighter. Jealousy, greed. But I try to look for the best in everybody. Who knows. DS: What do you think are the greatest threats to humanity? :AN: Humanity itself. You can typically read anywhere that humanity is a virus, a plague, on Mother Earth. I really think the greatest threat to humanity is not a meteor or comet hurtling toward the planet, it's us. We'll be our own undoing. Bad politics, the spread of...oh, man, I could get in trouble... DS: Who would you get in trouble with? :AN: No, I don't know who I could get in trouble with. But I definitely think that capitalism is something that having gone unchecked for so long isn't doing right in delivering civil freedom. It's not delivering on its promises. Then again, I play in a rock band and people come pay to see me. I understand it works on both levels. DS: What would be a bigger turn-off in bed: a woman who spoke in a baby voice, or someone who was overly flatulent? :AN: Oh God! I'd go with the baby talk, man. DS: You'd prefer the baby talk? :AN: No, I would go with the flatulent woman. At least she's real. DS: Have you ever been faced with either scenario? :AN: No, I don't think women should be flatulent. DS: At all? Not even if she lets out a little giggle afterwards? :AN: Yeah, well, so be it. DS: What if she was really flatulent? :AN: Like, extremely flatulent? I'd go more for the flatulence. Baby talk...that's a real boner killer. Sorry, man. DS: And you've never had a baby talker? :AN: No, not since high school. DS: In high school? :AN: Oh, yeah. She had to go. DS: What if she was Dutch oven flatulent? :AN: Is it really one or the other? Can I just go gay? DS: You can always go gay. It's the new millennium. :AN: Yeah, well, I'd probably end up with a baby-talking overly flatulent man, I'm sure."

entertainment,"Protesters affiliated with the Palestine Solidarity Campaign disrupted a performance by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Thursday evening as part of The Proms concert season. The disruption forced the BBC to cut short a live broadcast of the orchestra playing Bruch's violin concerto. 30 people were removed from the auditorium but no arrests were made. The BBC made a statement regarding the disruption: ""We regret that as a result of sustained audience disruption within the concert hall which affected the ability to hear the music, tonight’s Israel Philharmonic Orchestra Prom was taken off air."" Outside the concert hall, around twenty people protested with banners. According to comments on a Facebook page linked to by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, there was a planned ""Zionist counter-demonstration"". The same Facebook page also has a comment posted at 4:12pm giving advice for attendees: They can't gag you, so you can still shout and interrupt it! ... Just co-ordinate yourselves, but do not rely on texts etc because they will most likely block mobile communications. Maybe set watches or reminders in phones to the same times, then you are at least prepared when one of you jump up to interrupt, and then the chorus of you can join in! Get the external protesters to wriggle their way to staff/back stage entrances as hungry fans! Wear a load of Christian crosses and start sic of davids....and/or women cover your hair 'jewish style' with long veil bandanas etc. The disruption follows a failed attempt by activists to prevent the performance from happening in the first place."

entertainment,"obituaries Acclaimed actor and singer Debbie Reynolds died at the age of 84 yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California. Her son, Todd Fisher, said around noon yesterday she suffered a stroke brought on by the stress of the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher. Reynolds' credits include lead roles in films Singin' in the Rain, Bundle of Joy, and The Unsinkable Molly Brown, the last of which earned her an Academy Award nomination. She worked to preserve Hollywood history and memorabilia for posterity and, like Carrie Fisher, as an advocate for mental health awareness. Born Mary Francis Reynolds in 1932, she was given the stage name ""Debbie"" by Warner Brothers director Jack Warner, which she would later say was done without her permission. She would go on to spend twenty years with MGM studios. Reynolds received a Tony Award nomination for her acting in the 1973 revival of Irene. Reynolds' business interests included owning various private museums of film memorabilia as part of her personal Hollywood history preservation project. She would often purchase and hold items such as Marilyn Monroe's dress from The Seven Year Itch and Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra headdress until they could be displayed to the public. More recently, she was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2000 for a Will &amp; Grace recurring role and appeared as the main character's mother in HBO's Behind the Candelabra. She worked as a voice actress on animated productions such as the children's show Kim Possible and the more adult Family Guy. She was honored with the 2016 Academy Awards Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 2015. In Reynolds' personal life, her first husband and father of her two children, Eddie Fisher, very publicly left her for her friend Elizabeth Taylor. She declared bankruptcy in 1997 after a failed casino project. Carrie Fisher was an actor, author, and mental health advocate best known for acting in the Star Wars film series and for her novel Postcards from the Edge, which had a character inspired by her mother, Reynolds. Fisher was taken ill while flying from London to Los Angeles and died on Tuesday. Fisher and Reynolds did not speak for several years, though this rift was long over by the time of Fisher's death. According to Todd Fisher, he and his mother had been discussing his sister's funeral at his home shortly before the stroke; Reynolds said to him, ""I miss her so much, I want to be with Carrie."" Reynolds is survived by son Todd Fisher and granddaughter Billie Lourd."

The band, who won the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with Hard Rock Hallelujah, stated at the time they would like to star in a horror movie. They were one of a number of people promoting their films at the Cannes Film Festival this weekend; a ""Finland Bar"" was set up near the area. Mr Lordi, lead vocalist of the band, said at the time ""In a way it is traditional horror film, but a traditional modern horror film. It has monsters obviously in it... It has some twists in the plot, of course, it has some horrific scenes and a horrific mood, it is more like a psychological thing... Lordi goes to the twilight zone, that is pretty much (what) you can say."" Lordi also performed at the Cannes festival."
entertainment,"New Zealand Yesterday the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, presented song writer, Don McGlashan with his second Silver Scroll at an exclusive awards ceremony. The song that won him the prestigious APRA music award was the hit song Bathe in the River, which featured in the hit New Zealand movie No. 2 sung by Wellington singer, Hollie Smith. McGlashan won his first Silver Scroll in 1994 for his song Anchor Me when he was with the band The Mutton Birds. Anthony Healey, APRA New Zealand Director, said: ""Bathe in the River is a song that captures the hearts and emotions of everyone who hears it. All Don's music is emotive and powerful and this song is no exception. ...Absolute classic."" There were four other songs that were finalists in the award that is based on songwriting, not record sales. One other song that was written by McGlashan was a finalist. Other winners at the ceremony were: *Richard Bennett was presented with the Maioha Award at the Silver Scroll ceremony for his waiata E Hine (waiata is the Māori term for song and singing). *Ross Harris's song Symphony No. 2 won the Sounz Contemporary award for the third time.

A police officer for the Miami Dade Police Department spotted the body while he was working on the show which was being filmed in Bicentennial Park in Miami, Florida. The cast of the show were attempting to get shots from the air using a helicopter when the officer spotted the body floating a few yards from the set's location.

entertainment,"Culture and entertainment Over the weekend, tributes were paid to US actor Chadwick Boseman, including Sunday's commercial-free airing of Black Panther and a special retrospective about Boseman entitled ""A Tribute For a King"" by American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Boseman died on Friday after being diagnosed with colon cancer four years earlier. Boseman, who rose to international fame for his title role in the 2018 Marvel superhero film Black Panther, was 43 years old. Boseman died at home on August 28 in the company of his wife and family according to a statement posted to his official Twitter account. It also stated he was in stage IV of his cancer which had been diagnosed in 2016. His illness was not public information, even as he had undergone surgeries and chemotherapy to treat it, all the while continuing to work. Boseman was born in South Carolina. He attended the British American Drama Academy (BADA) during his studies at Howard University from which he graduated in 2000. Early in his career, Boseman acted in television soap operas, however, his role as Jackie Robinson in film 42 was widely considered a breakthrough. He later played starring roles in other biographical films portraying James Brown in Get On Up and Thurgood Marshall in Marshall. Boseman portrayed Black Panther, also known as King T'Challa, in four Marvel films. The first was Captain America: Civil War which preceded the aforementioned Black Panther film. Subsequently, he appeared in both Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther, wrote of Boseman, ""I noticed then that Chad was an anomaly"", recalling their first meeting. ""He was calm. Assured. Constantly studying. But also kind, comforting, had the warmest laugh in the world, and eyes that saw much beyond his years, but could still sparkle like a child seeing something for the first time."" Actor Denzel Washington, who paid for Boseman to attend BADA, stated ""He was a gentle soul and a brilliant artist, who will stay with us for eternity through his iconic performances over his short yet illustrious career … God bless Chadwick Boseman."" Wayne A. I. Frederick, president of Howard University, wrote ""It is with profound sadness that we mourn the loss of alumnus Chadwick Boseman who passed away this evening. His incredible talent will forever be immortalized through his characters and through his own personal journey from student to superhero! Rest in Power, Chadwick!"" On Sunday, the MTV Video Music Awards also marked the passing of Boseman by dedicating the show to him. The audience was also shown a replay from the 2018 ceremony when Boseman gave his ""Best Hero"" award to James Shaw Jr. who disarmed a shooter at a restaurant in Tennessee. During ABC's ""A Tribute For a King"", Sunday evening, a number of celebrities made appearances. Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Feige, Bob Iger, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Winston Duke, Mark Ruffalo, and Paul Rudd, all contributed. During the broadcast, Downey said of Boseman, ""He was having this immense success, in a strata of his own, humble hardworking, always smile on his face … Black Panther was hands down the crowning achievement of the Marvel Universe. The one where people got to vote with ticket sales we require this. It is a fantastic movie that leveled the playing field."" The Walt Disney Company owns both Marvel Studios and ABC."
entertainment,"Legendary R&amp;B singer Fats Domino is missing, three days after Hurricane Katrina hit in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The singer told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He has not been heard from since Sunday night. It was reported on Wednesday that his house was flooded, though there were no reports on whether Domino and his family were able to escape. Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit. Antoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, ""The Fat Man"". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous Top 40 singles, perhaps his most notable were Blue Monday and a cover of Blueberry Hill. Domino retired from touring in the 1980s, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or an invitation to the White House were able to get Domino to leave the town."

A spokeswoman for Endemol India told BBC News that contestants will have to remain chaste in the Big Brother house for three months. ""Participants will be told to keep their hands to themselves,"" she revealed. ""India is a conservative society and it is not ready for the raunchy scenes that so characterise the programmes in the West,"" she added. And unlike other versions of Big Brother around the world, India's version will not be transmitted live in a bid to avoid showing unpleasant scenes which may cause controversy. It is understood that up to twelve contestants will participate in the show, which is to be televised at the end of this year. The show’s producers have said they want stars from Bollywood, Indian television and cricket to live in the Big Brother compound. The managing director of Endemol India, Rajesh Kamat, said both Hindus and Muslims may be chosen, but that issues between religions would not be talked about on the programme. India is still quite a conservative society. Close acts like kissing are never seen on TV, and only a small number of couples cohabit before marriage. In 2006, two housemates were removed from Australia's version of Big Brother after apparently sexually assaulting a female contestant. Big Brother was created in the Netherlands in 1999 and has sold to almost seventy different countries."

entertainment,"David Byrne, the former lead singer of 1980s art punk band Talking Heads, is suing Florida governor Charlie Crist over the latter's use of the Talking Heads song ""Road to Nowhere"" in an election commercial. Byrne alleges that Crist made use of the song in a campaign commercial without the artist's permission, and that if permission had been asked Byrne would have declined it. Byrne told the BBC that the lawsuit, in which the musician is claiming $1 million in damages, is ""not about politics, it's about copyright"". In his personal blog, though, Byrne commented: ""Besides being theft, use of the song and my voice in a campaign ad implies that I, as writer and singer of the song, might have granted Crist permission to use it, and that I therefore endorse him and/or the Republican Party, of which he was a member until very, very recently."" Governor Crist is running for election to the United States Senate as an independent. The lawsuit was filed early Monday afternoon in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa and has been assigned Case Number 8:10-CV1187-T26 (MAP). Byrne is represented by Lawrence Iser, the attorney who represented Jackson Browne when Browne successfully sued John McCain in a similar lawsuit in 2008. The advertisement, which premiered on January 12, 2010 and has since been withdrawn from use, attacked politician Marco Rubio over reversals in Rubio's public positions. The video has been blocked on video hosting site YouTube ""due to a copyright claim by Warner Music Group."" Governor Crist's campaign had no comment on the lawsuit."

entertainment,"Culture and entertainment On Friday, US director and screenwriter James Gunn was fired from work on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 for Marvel Studios reportedly for his offensive tweets from 2008 to 2011 about, amongst other things, rape and paedophilia. In a statement, Walt Disney Studios' Chairman Alan Horn said, ""The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him"". The Walt Disney Company owns Marvel Studios. James Gunn wrote the screenplay and directed Marvel movies Guardians of the Galaxy, released in 2014, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, released in 2017. Based on the comic book characters in the Marvel Comics, the movie franchise featured Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillian as well as Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as voice cast for CGI characters. The two movies earned a worldwide box office revenue of about USD 773 million and USD 864 million per Box Office Mojo's statistics. Gunn had been writing the third movie in the franchise reportedly to be released in 2020. Responding to his firing, James Gunn said, ""My words of nearly a decade ago were, at the time, totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative. I have regretted them for many years since — not just because they were stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive, and certainly not provocative like I had hoped, but also because they don't reflect the person I am today or have been for some time. Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then."" In one of the old tweets, Gunn wrote, ""The best thing about being raped is when you're done being raped and it's like 'whew this feels great, not being raped!'"" Dave Bautista, who portrays Drax the Destroyer in Gunn's Marvel movies, tweeted about Gunn's dismissal saying, ""James Gunn is one of the most loving, caring, good natured people I have ever met. He's gentle and kind and cares deeply for people and animals. He's made mistakes. We all have. I'm NOT ok with what's happening to him"". After Gunn was fired, David Dastmalchian, an actor in the latest Marvel Studios movie Ant-Man and the Wasp wrote on Instagram, ""i've been saying this FOR YEARS! @jamesgunn is one of the most amazing people I've ever known - both professionally &amp; personally. there are so many people in our lives that we would never have known without the incredible magnet of talent &amp; goodness that is James ... thanks for making us a part of your family, buddy."""

This decision was announced less than a week after the performer prematurely ended a concert in Newcastle upon Tyne. Earlier reports attributed Meat Loaf's medical problems at Newcastle to a sore throat. This week's announcements indicate that the rocker sustained a vocal cord cyst that requires weeks of treatment and possibly surgery. Despite Meat Loaf's indication at the Newcastle concert that his career might have ended, a most recent statement on his fan site declared that he would be ""coming back strong in 2008"" with hopes of new concerts following treatment."
entertainment,"German rock and metal label GUN Records (Great Unlimited Noises) announced Friday that they were to close. No explanation has been given for the move. Formed as a joint venture between BMG and Wolfgang Funk in 1992, the label had seen its parent merge with Sony in 2005 to form Sony BMG and Funk quit as president in December 2008. In the nineties the label worked with German metal bands such as U.D.O., Sodom and Running Wild. GUN's current international acts - including Wales' Bullet for My Valentine, Finland's Lordi and the Netherlands' Within Tempatation - will now be handled out of Sony's Munich international division. National artists, such as Oomph! and The Donots, will also be Sony's direct responsibility via either Four Music or Columbia Germany in Berlin.

entertainment,"In an interview on the United States television show Good Morning America today, U.S. vice president Joe Biden said that a positive consensus on same-sex marriage is ""inevitable"" as the country ""evolves."" source=Joe Biden ""There is inevitability for a national consensus on gay marriage. I think the country's evolving. And I think you're going to see, you know, the next effort is probably going to be to deal with so-called DOMA,"" said Biden. Biden's remarks come just days after U.S. president Barack Obama signed into law, the repeal of Don't ask, don't tell (DADT). The repeal, which was signed by Obama on Thursday, will now allow gay and lesbian service members to serve openly in the country's military, without fear that they will be discharged from service. A report by The Pentagon earlier this month concluded most U.S. service personnel do not believe reform of the rules on gays and lesbians serving in the military would affect morale, unit cohesion or military effectiveness. The report found only 30% believed that changing the law would have a negative effect. DADT, in effect for 17 years, was repealed by the United States Senate on Saturday. The military will cease enforcement of the policy in 60 days time, after the Pentagon has certified to Congress that it, and the military are ready to implement the new law. ""This is a very good day,"" Obama told a crowd of soldiers and senior military officials on Thursday. ""This morning I'm proud to sign a law that will bring an end to 'don't ask, don't tell'. No longer will tens of thousands of Americans be asked to live a lie in order to serve the country that they love."" Obama added that the government would ""not drag their feet"" and they were ""committed to implementing this change swiftly and efficiently."" Currently, same-sex marriage is only legal in five of the 50 U.S. states; Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, including the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.). In 2008, same-sex marriage was banned in California after voters approved Proposition 8. It was later overturned by a federal judge in San Francisco who deemed the measure unconstitutional."
entertainment,"BBC Some 8,400 complaints have been made to the BBC and 374 complaints have been received by Ofcom, a British media regulator, after soap opera EastEnders broadcasted what BBC News Online described as the ""cot death storyline"". The storyline involves character Ronnie Branning – portrayed by Samantha Womack – taking her baby, who experienced sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and exchanging for another living baby, Alfie and Kat Moon's recently born son. The plot has caused the largest number of complaints to be made about the show since it was first broadcast in 1985. Campaigners attempting to raise awareness of SIDS criticised the plot. Anne Diamond, a television presenter and one of those campaigners, remarked that the exchange of the babies was a ""crass twist to an otherwise credible storyline"" and said that not ""one iota of good in educating a young audience about cot death"" had been achieved by it. Due to the complaints received, the BBC have made the decision to end this storyline earlier than originally scheduled, during the spring of 2011. Bryan Kirkwood, the current executive producer of EastEnders, has disclosed that, at the end of this storyline, the baby, named Tommy, will remeet Kat Moon, his mother. EastEnders executive producer Kirkwood said that this storyline, like many others in the BBC One programme, approaches ""social issues in a powerful and dramatic way"". He also explained: ""Although we have had complaints we have also had positive responses from people who have been through the experiences we are currently dramatising who feel we've done this and have contacted us to offer their backing. ""Whenever we embark on a story at EastEnders we always leave it open-ended to monitor and listen to audience reaction,"" he continued. ""With this in mind we are going to bring the story to a close on screen in the spring. As the story progresses and Kat is reunited with her child, we hope to explore the impact of the tragic events that have befallen the characters in a way that is powerful, but true to the best public service tradition of the show."" Justine Roberts, the chief executive officer and founder of British community website Mumsnet, created a letter of complaint for Mark Thompson, Director-General of the BBC. ""The focus of the complaint is the swapping story line,"" the letter reads. ""Our members are concerned that, as is all too common, a bereaved mother has been portrayed as deranged and unhinged."" Do you think that a storyline like this is unsuitable for broadcast? In response to the Mumsnet letter, Jana Bennett, director of vision at the BBC, stated that this plot was managed in a manner that was ""sensitively handled"". She stressed that ""the show is absolutely not suggesting that this behaviour is typical of a mother who has suffered such a terrible and tragic loss. ""Taking Kat's baby is the action of a character in great distress due to a series of events that have befallen her in the last 18 months,"" Bennett explained. ""It is the culmination of these that has driven her to this one moment of madness rather than as a direct result of the loss of her baby. The issues of grief caused by the loss of a child and sudden infant death syndrome more generally are sensitively handled. EastEnders has a long history of tackling difficult issues in a way that allows viewers to learn and debate the topic at hand."" On Thursday, Samantha Womack denied that this storyline was the reason for her leaving the programme. She has mentioned that her departure had already been arranged with producers of the programme for a few months. Before this incident occurred, the record for the highest number of complaints for EastEnders was a storyline in April 2009 that involved Danielle Jones being killed as the result of a car collision. That storyline received in excess of 7,000 complaints."

entertainment,"Producers of the film Superhero Movie, out today, released clips from the film on the Internet parodying a Church of Scientology promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise. Superhero Movie is written and directed by Scott Mazin, director of the 2000 comedy about superheroes The Specials. The film stars Drake Bell, Sara Paxton, Christopher McDonald, Pamela Anderson, Tracy Morgan, Regina Hall, Craig Bierko, Simon Rex, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Kevin Hart, Jeffrey Tambor, Ryan Hansen, Brent Spiner and Keith David. Drake Bell plays Rick Riker, a young man figuring out how to use his superpowers. The film parodies blockbuster superhero movies including Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four. In the original Scientology video, Cruise discusses his faith and his opinion on what it means to be a Scientologist, while the theme music from his Mission: Impossible series of films plays in the background. The video, which was not intended for public distribution outside of the Church of Scientology, is nine minutes long and contains heavy use of Scientology terminology. The video appeared on YouTube January 15, two days before the release of a biography on Cruise by Andrew Morton: Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography. The Church of Scientology sent legal letters to YouTube and to Gawker.com, sites which were hosting the Cruise video at the time, and requested that they take it down. YouTube complied, but Gawker.com did not, and Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented: ""It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it."" The video later appeared on websites other than Gawker.com, including the New York Post, Independent Television News and the BBC. Attempts by the Church of Scientology to remove the video from the Internet motivated an Internet-based group known as ""Anonymous"" to take action in a movement called Project Chanology. Members of Anonymous bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down, including Scientology.org. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10 and March 15, with another international protest planned for April 12. According to Scientology critic David S. Touretzky, the Scientology terms used in the video by Cruise have ""entered the national lexicon"", and the Scientology video itself has become something of an Internet phenomenon. Touretzky also referred to the negative effect on Cruise's publicity as a consequence of the leak. 4=Liz Shannon Miller, NewTeeVee In the excerpt released online from Superhero Movie, actor Miles Fisher imitates Cruise in what Liz Shannon Miller of NewTeeVee described as ""an eerily dead-on impersonation of Cruise’s infamous leaked Scientology indoctrination video"". She also compared the clip to a different spoof of the Cruise video, by actor Jerry O'Connell. Craig Ferguson also spoofed the video in a clip on his show on CBS, The Late Late Show, as did the comedy website Super Deluxe. Christopher McDonald plays the villain ""Hourglass"" in Superhero Movie, and told MTV News he was surprised at some of the parodies that successfully appear in the film: ""The thing I didn't think we'd get away with was the actual Tom Cruise stuff. There may be lawsuits there."" A post at Slashfilm wrote positively of Fisher's performance: ""Slashfilm would like to salute young actor and Harvard alum Miles Fisher for easily giving the best impression of Tom Cruise we’ve ever seen in the yuk-yuk comic book spoof."" A post at MoviesOnline commented: ""The actor hits every point he needs to and it is almost scary how close he is to the actual Tom Cruise way of thinking."" Thomas Leupp of ReelzChannel.com called the scene ""a dead-on spoof of Tom Cruise's now-infamous Scientology video"". Ryan Parsons of CanMag wrote that Fisher impersonates Cruise ""perfectly"", and Ryan Tate of Gawker.com called the clip ""the slickest crazy-Cruise imitation yet, as well as one of the funniest""."

Officials from the Spanish island of Majorca that Stephen had suffered from an accumulation of fluid on the lungs, or as it is known in scientific terms, a pulmonary edema. The 33-year-old singer was found dead on a sofa in the lounge of his apartment. He had been out of the accommodation for the night while he was partying with Andrew Cowles, who was his partner. There was a court hearing held earlier today in Majorca. The hearing only lasted for a short time. The judge had decided that the family of Stephen Gately would be allowed to take his body back to the Republic of Ireland, the country in which Gately grew up and had lived in, by plane. After discovering Stephen's death, the other members of Boyzone took a plane flight to Majorca, so as to comfort Andrew Cowles. They have now flown back to their homes."
entertainment,"New Zealand Wikinews has compiled the views from various politicians on New Zealand's latest digital television service, Freeview. Those interviewed were Sue Kedgley, Jonathan Coleman, and Steve Maharey, the broadcasting spokespeople for their respective parties; the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, the New Zealand National Party, and the New Zealand Labour Party. Freeview, modelled after the United Kingdom's Freeview, is competing directly with New Zealand's only other digital pay TV provider, Sky Network Television. Sky reaches around 44.5% of New Zealand households. However, unlike Sky, Freeview has no on-going subscription fees, and only has a one-off fee for a set-top box and, if needed, a satellite dish. The Labour-led Government has provided Freeview with around NZ$25 million over a five-year period to help New Zealand change from the old analogue technology and align itself ""as the rest of the world moves to digital television broadcasting,"" Mr Maharey said. The funding use is monitored by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Dr Coleman also described the same reasons why Freeview was necessary for New Zealand and is supported by the National Party. However, Ms Kedgley takes a different approach and describes the Freeview service as ""a belated and inadequate response to the digital challenge"", but does state that digital TV is the ""growth area."" She also said that the Government is now trying to catch up after they scrapped TVNZ's (Television New Zealand) digital plan, which she describes as far more ambitious. National, despite being supportive of Freeview, think that the Government has not done a good job with Freeview, describing it as a ""white elephant"". Firstly because Dr Coleman says there isn't enough good programming currently available to get people interested in switching, and, secondly, there hasn't been a definite date when analogue transmission will be cut off. Mr Maharey said that the Government is engaging various broadcasters and interested parties to get a definite analogue switch off date, and talk about other various regulatory factors. He expects the date to be within the next six to ten years. While the Greens do welcome the new government-funded TVNZ channels, a news and current affairs channel and a family-related channel (TVNZ 7 and TVNZ 6 respectively), ""The whole exercise however, smacks of too little, too late."" They also say that the amount of funding allocated to new programming cannot pose a threat to Sky. But do support ""packaging and marketing ... existing TVNZ content on the emerging digital platforms."" MediaWorks, which runs TV3 and C4, will announce their two new channels in around 18-months. And Triangle TV will add their own channel, Stratos TV, in October, 2007. National are questioning Mr Maharey why he hadn't released the viewer number figures. Dr Coleman said that Mr Maharey was trying to distance himself away from the ""reality"" of what was going on. So Wikinews requested, under the Official Information Act, the amount of set-top boxes sold. The request was denied as Freeview was to release the information themselves in a months time. On August 13 the figures were released, with a total over 21,000. General Manager Steve Browning said that “we're tracking well ahead of forecast”. Mr Maharey concurred with what Mr Browning said, saying it exceeds their first year expectations. Ms Kedgley, Dr Coleman, and Mr Maharey all say that they don't have Freeview, nor know anyone who has the service. Though, Mr Maharey will consider getting it when more channels and the 2008 terrestrial service is launched in eight major New Zealand cities."
entertainment,"Jessica Sierra is pregnant, according to the Falkenburg Road Jail in Tampa, Florida, where she is imprisoned awaiting trial for charges of disorderly intoxication, violating parole and resisting arrest. Sierra became famous after once reaching the finals of American Idol. Reports have been made by the prison infirmary that Sierra has been moved to a pregnancy diet and is confirmed to be pregnant. The father is said to be an unidentified rap musician. Sierra had originally been due to go before a judge on the 20th, but her pregnancy has caused this to be postponed indefinitely. Sierra was arrested on December 2 outside a local bar, and is being held without bond. Police claim that after they arrived, she first assaulted an officer then attempted to bribe him by offering to perform a sex act on him. Only two weeks earlier she had pleaded no contest to charges of battery and possessing cocaine. If she is convicted of all the new charges, she could be imprisoned for up to 11 years, which would mean she would have the baby whilst still in prison. Sierra earlier pled not guilty to all charges."
entertainment,"England Stars from the world of showbusiness joined fans and mourners yesterday at the funeral of the popular entertainer Cilla Black. Her coffin was transported in a cortege in Liverpool where she grew up, with hundreds of people paying their respects. Some were holding memorabilia related to Black's 50-year long career in entertainment, which included singing and presenting television programmes such as Blind Date. Tom Williams, auxiliary bishop of Liverpool, conducted the Roman Catholic mass in St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Liverpool's Woolton area. This is the same church that Black got married in 1969 to Bobby Willis, who died in 1999 after 30 years of marriage. Eulogies were delivered by Cliff Richard and Paul O'Grady together with poems read by two of Black's sons. Further tributes were paid by Tom Jones, who flew in specially for the funeral. After the service, Black was to be interred in a private ceremony, next to the graves of her parents at the Allerton cemetery. She died early this month, aged 72, after she fell at her home in Spain and suffered a stroke."
entertainment,"Marvel Comics announced Thursday that an upcoming issue of a Spider-Man comic will feature United States President-elect Barack Obama meeting the web-slinging superhero. A six-page tongue-in-cheek story, to appear in The Amazing Spider-Man issue 583, ""Spidey Meets the President!"" is created by Zeb Wells, Todd Nauck and Frank D'Armata. The issue features Peter Parker visiting Washington, D.C., on photo assignment to cover the Presidential and Vice Presidential inauguration ceremony. The Chameleon is also in town, hoping to sabotage the ceremony with a look-a-like impostor of Obama. Parker's alter-ego Spiderman must save the day from his arch-enemy's nefarious plans. The issue will appear on newsstands January 14, before the actual inauguration. Among the lines of dialog in the issue are ""Ya hear that, Chameleon? The president-elect here just appointed me ... secretary of shuttin' you up."" The issue will have a commemorative cover, and retail for US$3.99 (£2.65). Alan Giroux, owner of All About Books and Comics in Phoenix, says he predicts the issue to be on the collectors' market for $20 by the first day. ""This issue will have a lot of heat and go for premium prices. I already have people calling about it,"" he said. The issue's cover will feature Obama smiling, with a thumbs up pose. Spiderman is featured hanging upside-down beside him, whispering: ""Hey, if you get to be on my cover, can I be on the dollar bill?"" The issue is not official merchandise of the US Democratic Party, Obama campaign, the Obama-Biden Transition Project, or White House. According to Marvel comic's editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, the publication series learned that the President-elect is a long-time fan and collector as a kid of the Marvel super hero. ""When we heard that president-elect Obama is a collector of Spider-Man comics, we knew that these two historic figures had to meet in our comics' Marvel Universe. A Spider-Man fan moving into the Oval Office is an event that must be commemorated in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man."" During his campaigning, Mr. Obama made mention of Spider-Man at child-oriented events. He told Entertainment Weekly magazine that Batman and Spider-Man were his favorite superheroes, because of their ""inner turmoil"". Quesada remarked that ""there is a long history of presidents appearing in Spider-Man comics, from Franklin D. Roosevelt through to George W. Bush, who has appeared on several occasions."" President Ronald Reagan appeared in the pages of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Bill Clinton appeared in Superman: The Man of Steel and Richard Nixon in Watchmen."
entertainment,"Trinidad's Ian Alleyene, host of TV6's Crime Watch, has been released on bail. He spent the weekend in custody after being charged under the Sexual Offences Act following television broadcasts allegedly showing a mentally ill teenage girl's rape. Arrested on April 20, Alleyne spent the weekend in a hospital and the night of April 23 in police custody. He is now free after a Port of Spain magistrate granted his release on TT$80,000 (About US$13,300). The case is adjourned until May 14, when the owner of the TV station, Caribbean Communications Network, is summonsed to also appear in court regarding the same broadcasts. The charges, filed just days before the statute of limitations expired, allege footage was thrice broadcast in October 2011 which allowed public identification of a rape victim. A fourth charge alleges Alleyne, who's lawyer says has no previous convictions, obstructed the police investigation. 4=Ian Alleyne The fourth charge relates to an incident last week at Caribbean Communications Network's Independence Square premises in Port of Spain. Alleyne was ultimately arrested publicly but police claim they first asked him to attend a police station. Alleyne was taken to court early yesterday morning where he appeared before Chief Magistrate Marcia Ayers-Caesar in a hearing witnessed by journalists and his family. Thirty minutes after bail was granted he had posted it and was freed, meeting supporters protesting against the prosecution outside the courthouse. ""If you go back to the genesis of this entire incident you will realise it is just a travesty of justice,"" he told the press. Walking through Port of Spain upon his release, he twice mounted tables to address following supporters. ""They can lock me up for a month, they can lock me up for two months, but I will still come out and will continue my fight for you. As long as there is breath in my body, I will continue fighting for you, the poor people."" During the hearing, court officials were accused by the magistrate of breaching procedure. Alleyne had been taken directly into the court before it had opened, and was fed breakfast there. Superintendent of the Court and Process Branch Kenneth Cordner promised to ""hold some training sessions to ensure that the officers fully understand their roles"" and called the incident ""upsetting."" Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard warned local media yesterday not to prejudice any trial, noting the high public interest in the case. Gaspard said doing so would ""would constitute an unwelcome and unfortunate interference with the due administration of justice and may properly provide a sufficient basis upon which a citation for contempt may be fastened."" Also yesterday, Alleyne took to the studio and returned to his position hosting Crime Watch. He denies all charges."
entertainment,"Michael Jackson, a singer and songwriter who was dubbed as the 'King of Pop', has died today at the age of 50. Initial reports had stated that Jackson is in a coma after being rushed to UCLA Medical Center. According to TMZ, rescue crews from the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to his home in Holmby Hills, a suburb of Los Angeles, California where they found Jackson not breathing. According to Fire Captain Steven Ruda, a 911 call was received from Jackson's home at 12:21 p.m. PDT (19:21 UTC), and paramedics responded just before 12:30 p.m. PDT (19:30 UTC). Paramedics unsuccessfully attempted CPR, for a suspected cardiac arrest. According to Lieutenant Fred Corral, the L.A. County Coroner, Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PDT (21:26 UTC). The Los Angeles Times and Associated Press have said they have confirmed his death with anonymous sources familiar with the situation. According to CNN, the road on which Jackson lived has been blocked off in an attempt to reduce traffic. Jackson began his career with The Jackson 5 which debuted in 1966. Despite numerous hits and best sellers, Jackson is probably most known for his 1982 hit Thriller. It's estimated that the album sold as many at 109 million worldwide. The news failed to reach some quarters quickly. As of 01:00 UTC the web site of the O2 arena, where Jackson had been scheduled to perform his This Is It concerts in July, was still advertising tickets for sale. Several companies, including Ticketmaster, Seatwave, and AEG Live, now face having to reimburse all ticket sales. AEG Live had already faced problems obtaining insurance for the concerts. Many celebrities were quick to publish comments and tributes: ;Britney Spears:""He was a wonderful man and will be greatly missed."" ;Ludacris:""If it were not for Michael Jackson I would not be where or who I am today. His music and legacy will live on forever. Prayers to the family."" ;John Mayer:""I hope he is memoralised as the '83 moonwalking, MTV owning, mesmerizing, unstoppable, invincible Michael Jackson."" ;Miley Cyrus:""Michael Jackson was my inspiration. love and blessings."" ;MC Hammer:""I will be mourning my friend, brother, mentor and inspiration... He gave me and my family hope. I would never have been without him."" Several, including Celine Dion, Randy Jackson, and Donald Tarlton, compared the news of Jackson's death to the news of the deaths of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, and John Lennon. Talking to Larry King, Dion said ""It feels like when Kennedy died, when Elvis died. It's an amazing loss."" A Yorkshire businessman who was working with Jackson on a proposed future project said ""I didn't think he would go out in these circumstances. It's not the way I would have expected him to go at all. He's going to become a Marilyn Monroe or an Elvis Presley."""
entertainment,"The Canadian film industry's major awards night, the Genie Awards, takes place on Monday. The Genie Awards begun in 1949 as the Canadian Film Awards, and current nominations include the films L'Âge des ténèbres, Away from Her, Continental, un film sans fusil, Eastern Promises, and Shake Hands With the Devil. Notably absent from the nominations is the film Juno, an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture. Most of the lead actors in Eastern Promises and Away from Her were not Canadian, and Eastern Promises was filmed overseas. The leads of Juno, in comparison, are all Canadian, and the movie was filmed in the country, despite the financial backing for the film being from an American source. Juno is an excellent film and the Academy salutes its success, which reflects the work of many talented Canadians both in front of and behind the camera. Regrettably, the filmmakers decided not to enter the film into the Genie Awards. In order to be eligible for the Genies, a film must be Canadian, as defined by CAVCO and the CRTC. These are the accepted industry standards for recognizing a film as Canadian. Ultimately, it's up to the filmmaker to decide whether to seek Canadian certification. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the reasons for a filmmaker's decision, or why they may or may not qualify. Sara Morton, CEO of the Academy of Canadian Cinema &amp; Television CAVCO is the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office, part of the Department of Canadian Heritage. The CRTC is the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, a communications authority like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States, Independent Television Commission (ITC) in the UK (excluding Wales), and the Australian Communications and Media Authority."

Johnny Mans, Bygraves' agent, confirmed Bygraves had died as he slept in his home of Hope Island, in the Australian state of Queensland, Friday night. ""We have lost one of the best entertainers that Britain has ever produced"", said Mans, calling his death ""a great loss to the entertainment profession and a great loss to all of his friends in the industry."" Bygraves, whose catchphrase was ""I wanna tell you a story"", was born Walter William Bygraves in 1922. He received the first name Max for impersonating Max Miller, another English comedian, while entertaining at the Royal Air Force RAF. He became an entertainer there having been prohibiting from joining the RAF for having inadequate eyesight. Bygraves became notable for performing various self-composed comedic songs, as well as for his appearances on the Royal Variety Show. He was at one time the presenter of ITV game show Family Fortunes. ""He as a person never dated,"" ex-radio broadcaster Ed Stewart said of Bygraves, who was his friend. ""He was a great character with a great sense of humour, a lovely family and it's just a shame that he's gone, but at nearly 90, he had a good run. He was an entertainer through and through."" His works provided ""a lot of pleasure to a lot of people and were huge sellers,"" Stewart said. During 2005, Bygraves emigrated to Australia from his UK residence in Bournemouth, in the south west of England. His family reported that he was experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia, earlier this year.

entertainment,"Copies of The Profit, a 2001 film blocked from distribution in the United States due to a court injunction won by the Church of Scientology, appeared on the Internet Friday on peer-to-peer file-sharing websites and on the video sharing site YouTube. Directed by former film executive Peter N. Alexander, the movie has been characterized by critics as a parody of Scientology and of its founder L. Ron Hubbard. Alexander was a Scientologist for twenty years, and left the organization in 1997. The film was funded by Bob Minton, a former critic of Scientology who later signed an agreement with the Church of Scientology and has attempted to stop distribution of the film. Alexander has stated that the movie is based on his research into cults, and when asked by the St. Petersburg Times about parallels to Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard said: ""I'll let you draw that conclusion ... I say it's entirely fictional."" The film was released in August 2001, and was shown at a movie theatre in Clearwater, Florida and at a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France. A Scientology spokesman gave a statement at the time saying ""the movie is fiction and has nothing to do with Scientology"". The Church of Scientology later took legal action in an attempt to stop further distribution of the film. The Church of Scientology claimed that the film was intended to influence the jury pool in the wrongful death case of Scientologist Lisa McPherson, who died under Scientology care in Clearwater, Florida. In April 2002, a Pinellas County, Florida judge issued a court order enjoining The Profit from worldwide distribution for an indefinite period. According to the original court injunction received by Wikinews, the movie was originally banned because the court found that it could be seen as a parody of Scientology. In his April 20, 2002 ruling on the injunction, Judge Robert E. Beach of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court in Pinellas County, Florida wrote: ""...an average person viewing the film entitled The Profit could perceive that it is a parody of the Church of Scientology"". ""To the extent that any person considered as a potential juror in evaluating any issues involving the Church of Scientology, the process of voir dire provides a fair and complete remedy to eliminate any potential juror that may possibly have been influenced to be less than fair and impartial,"" added Beach. Luke Lirot, the attorney for the film's production company, announced on the film's website on April 7, 2007 that ""We have absolutely no exposure for any repercussions from the court order,"" but that the film was still blocked from distribution due to an ongoing legal battle. Lirot wrote: ""all that's stopping the release of the movie is the legal battle with the partner who was compromised by Scientology (Robert Minton) and is currently using his power as partner to stop the release of the film."" In an October 2007 article, The Times described the film as ""banned in the US because of a lawsuit taken out against it by The Church of Scientology,"" and Russ Kick's The Disinformation Book of Lists included the film in his ""List of 16 Movies Banned in the U.S."". An 8-minute teaser segment from The Profit appeared on the film's website and on the video sharing site YouTube in February 2008, and an attorney representing Bob Minton sent a letter to Luke Lirot requesting that the film clip be taken down. In a response letter, Lirot wrote that ""Rather than damage any asset of the LLC, the short clip merely keeps the film in the public eye, and in a positive way."" On Friday, copies of the film began to circulate on peer-to-peer file-sharing websites and on YouTube. A link related to the film's appearance on the Internet on the community-based link aggregator website Digg.com had 3,638 ""Diggs"" - and hit the front page of the site's Entertainment section on Saturday. 4=Mark Bunker On Saturday, Scientology critic and Emmy award-winning journalist Mark Bunker put a streaming version of the film on his website, www.xenutv.com, and encouraged others to watch and discuss the film on a real-time chat channel. In a video posting to YouTube Saturday, Bunker said ""I did not do it. I had nothing to do with it ... I had nothing to do with this release at all. But I'm happy it's out there ... people are finally having a chance to see it. A lot of people have been curious over the years and there's been a lot of interest in seeing the film, so finally you can."" 4= Blogsreel On the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, a poster by the username ""Alexia Death"" commented on the film's appearance on the Internet in the context of censorship: ""It is out! And so it is a WIN if many people review it even if they say it SUCKS! ... Being bad is no cause to allow censorship ... And being censored is no cause to assume its good"". A post to the blog Blogsreel commented: ""We have all wanted to see this movie that scientology kept hidden away from us. We have all wondered just how damning could this story be that we were banned from watching it."" In a post on Sunday to the message board attached to the official website for the film, attorney Luke Lirot asked that individuals stop distributing copies of The Profit over the Internet. Lirot wrote: ""It has been brought to my attention that several unauthorized transmissions and downloads of this protected work have taken place over the last 72 hours. Such actions are copyright violations and are unlawful. I request that any further distribution and/or dissemination of this important work cease immediately and any copies of the work that have been downloaded please be deleted."" In his statement, Lirot recognized the rights of individuals under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also said that unauthorized distribution of the film ""will only serve to harm the goal of vast distribution"". Blog postings have attributed the film's appearance on the Internet as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology organized by the Internet-based group Anonymous, but this has not been confirmed. Wikinews previously reported on international protests against Scientology which took place as part of Project Chanology on February 10 and March 15. A third international protest by Anonymous is scheduled for April 12. Titled ""Operation Reconnect"", the third international protest will focus on highlighting Scientology's practice of disconnection."

He also said ""the Red Cross is doing everything they can,"" and stated that he was going to see what the maximum amount of money he can donate is. West criticized government authorities and stated that ""They've given them permission to go down and shoot us."" West first deviated from the script he and comedian Mike Myers were using by commenting on the recent uproar over differently captioned photos for black and white people in the aftermath of the hurricane: ""I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food."" Though a several-second delay was in place, the comments were let through uncensored on the EST live broadcast as the person in charge ""was instructed to listen for a curse word, and didn't realize he had gone off-script,"" according to an NBC spokeswoman. NBC has released a statement after the broadcast: ""Tonight's telecast was a live television event wrought with emotion. Kanye West departed from the scripted comments that were prepared for him, and his opinions in no way represent the views of the networks. It would be most unfortunate if the efforts of the artists who participated tonight and the generosity of millions of Americans who are helping those in need are overshadowed by one person's opinion."" The sponsor of the event, the American Red Cross, also issued a statement on the telethon, stating: ""During the telecast, a controversial comment was made by one of the celebrities. We would like the American public to know that our support is unwavering, regardless of political circumstances. We are a neutral and impartial organization, and support disaster victims across the country regardless of race, class, color or creed."""

entertainment,"Wikinews recently caught up with screenwriter and film producer Chad Ridgely to discuss his latest indie horror film, 6:66PM. The film is scheduled to show at the Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival in Buffalo, New York in November. WNIQ I've watched the teaser trailer. Tell us about the film's story line. *Chad Ridgely 6:66 P.M. is about a team of ghost hunters making a reality TV show about paranormal activity. The problem is, none of them are really ghost hunters. They stage the house to make it seem like the house they're exploring is haunted, except it turns out that the house really is haunted by the ghost of a serial killer. The serial killer isn't letting them get out of there without a fight. He tries to kill them and take possession of their bodies. So the crew is forced to try to capture some amazing footage for their show but at the same time avoid getting killed by this demon. It has some scary moments, but at the same time it's a comedy. We tried to blend the two together for a nice mix of scares and laughs and I think we did a really nice job of it. Many of us had worked together before so there was already a strong foundation in place and it let us play to everyone's strengths. WNIQ Who is producing the film? *CR The film was produced by my company, Full Auto Films, and Code 3 Films, which is Jim Klock's company. Producers are Jim Klock, Chad Ridgely, and Darrell Martinelli. WNIQ Will you guys be making the rounds at film festivals soon? *CR Yes, the film will world-premiere at the Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival in Buffalo, New York in early November 2017. We premiered our previous horror/comedy feature there, Massacre on Aisle 12, last year and we absolutely loved it. It's a great festival and Buffalo is amazing. I fell in love with the food there, especially the roast beef on weck sandwiches. I think I gained ten pounds while I was there. The food was that good. WNIQ Who wrote the script? *CR The script was written by Tommy McLaughlin and Chad Ridgely. WNIQ Where was the film shot primarily? *CR We filmed outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey. It was a little town called Egg Harbor City, which was a bit strange because I didn't see any eggs there, or a harbor, and the place was definitely too small to be a city. They did have a fantastic diner, though. We ate there every day before and sometimes after shooting. I'm beginning to see a pattern with food. WNIQ Have you signed any distribution deals? What are the hoped-for plans in terms of distribution? *CR Yes, the film will be distributed by Indican Pictures in late fall of 2017. Indican Pictures also distributed our previous horror/comedy, Massacre on Aisle 12, as well. WNIQ Any weird or funny events happen during filming? *CR Yes! We lived in the set house while we were filming, and we were convinced the place was really haunted. It was a secluded old farm house back in the woods, and late at night all sorts of weird things would happen. For instance, the door to my room would slowly creak open all by itself while I was sleeping. Jim Klock kept hearing footsteps creaking on the floorboards above his room, except there was no room above his. It was just the roof. There was also a very strange animal out in the woods that would make an incredibly creepy noise that we were never really able to identify. And of course, no one was going out there to look. In addition to scaring the crap out of us, it helped us bring additional authenticity to the film, which I think shows on screen."

entertainment,"After years of declining subscription rates, the owners of U.S. magazine TV Guide ordered a complete overhaul of the 52-year-old publication. Gemstar-TV Guide International, the corporate parent of the magazine says the current format of the magazine has caused it to become unprofitable. The changes will be effective with the October 15 issue. Lack of profitability has been a point of contention between Gemstar management and its largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Included in the new design is a shift away from detailed listings to more of a People or Entertainment Weekly celebrity-focused format. Included in that change will be the elimination of the 140 localized editions of TV Guide in favor of one national publication with only ""Eastern"" and ""Pacific"" times listed for program listings. The magazine's owners noted that with the advent of digital cable and satellite TV, more viewers rely upon electronic program guides provided free by the television service provider than printed listings. TV Guide officials say the current magazine is made up of 25 percent news content printed on glossy paper and 75 percent TV listings printed on newsprint and in black-and-white. The new version of the magazine will be completely four-color and on glossy paper. Additionally, the news-to-listing ratio will flip with 75 percent of future content being feature articles on celebrities and television programs. A second change will be the magazine's size as it moves from a digest-sized publication to a full-sized glossy. The company expects the larger edition will be more profitable against competition such as People and US Weekly. But that profitability may be at the expense of national reach. Although the magazine is getting physically larger, according to reports, the readership is expected to shrink. Gemstar expects many of is subscribers not to renew with the new format. Currently the TV Guide guarantees 9 million subscribers to its national advertisers. According to reports, it is only guaranteeing 3.2 million subscribers to its revamped publication once it hits newsstands."
entertainment,"The Bible The Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) has received 2,041 complaints within 3 days, calling for the Bible to be reclassified as ""indecent"", following a heated controversy sparked by the sex column of an university student newspaper, which was classified by the government's publication tribunal as ""indecent"". By 17 May, TELA decided not to submit the Bible to the tribunal. Two weeks ago, the Chinese university of Hong Kong's student newspaper sparked a public debate when it was found that they had asked readers if they fantasised about incest or bestiality, along with some soft sex stories and an unrelated abstract drawing about sex. Although there is no explicit description or pornographic photos, the paper was classified as ""Category II: Indecent"" by Obscene Articles Tribunal (OAT) on 14 May because it asked the question&amp;mdash; ""Have you fantasised about incest or bestiality?"". This classification means that the student editors have breached the law by distributing the paper to the public, will have a criminal record, and risk a jail sentence. Since then, OAT's decision has been hotly contested among teachers, activists, commentators and scholars. Complaints about the Bible then immediately flooded in to the authorities, claiming that the Bible is ""indecent"" due to its textual descriptions of rape and incest. The accusation was first made by a web site truthbible.net which said the holy book is full of sexual and violent content and its ""indecency"" far exceeds that of the recent sex column published in the Chinese University's student newspaper. A webmaster of truthbible.net, who wishes to remain anonymous, said if the sex column of the student's newspaper is indecent because of public complaints, ""there's no reasons not to judge the Bible as indecent"" because of its sexual content. By May 17 (UTC+8), TELA had received 2,041 complaints on the indecency of the Bible, up from 200 in three days. By the same day, TELA announced it will not submit the Bible to the Obscene Articles Tribunal for classification. ""The Bible is a religious text which is part of civilisation. It has been passed on from generation to generation. TELA considers that such longstanding religious texts or literature have not violated standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable members of the community."" According to the regulations in Hong Kong, any books classified as ""indecent"" by the OAT can only be sold or distributed to people over 18. All such publications must be sealed in a wrapper with a statutory warning notice. The CUHK Student Journals editorial board stated that the Bible complaints are not related to them, and they had no prior knowledge of such a movement."

Godwin became the first attorney to join the Electronic Frontier Foundation after its formation in 1990. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, Godwin commented on the issue of defamation online, ""The fear of defamation on the Internet is very strong. We’re going to be riding that social panic for a little bit."" He described his role at the Wikimedia Foundation, ""Part of my job is to prevent restrictive rules from being put in place that prevent people from participating in massively democratic participatory media. And then let the new norms settle."" He acknowledged he empathized with others that had been criticized on the Internet, ""Look, I have been smeared online. I know how bad it feels. It hurts.

The woman is in critical condition following the crash, which occurred in Fort Wayne, northeastern Indiana. The bus was headed to Six Flags St. Louis in Missouri for the band to play to a sold-out crowd. At 1:15 a.m. Saturday, according to witnesses, the bus was going through a green light when the car made a turn in front of it. No-one on the bus was injured, and the band rescheduled the show for September as a result of the incident. A photograph of the damaged bus was posted on the band's website, depicting moderate crumpling to the front area of the vehicle."
entertainment,"The trailer for Joss Whedon’s new feature film, Serenity, is expected to be released today (Tuesday, April 26). Joss Whedon, the creator of such prime time television successes as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, is promoting his latest movie with the official Serenity movie web site and a formal announcement. Joss Whedon has also warned fans of the Firefly show to avoid viewing the trailer, as it may be a spoiler for the movie, and may ruin their enjoyment. This popular television writer and creator developed Serenity as a follow up to Firefly, a genre defining Sci-Fi-Western that has received critical acclaim among science fiction enthusiasts, but failed to capture the interest of the typical prime time viewer. Firefly debuted on the FOX network in September, 2002, but was quickly canceled after one season. Serenity uses many of the same lead actors and characters as the original television series. In an interview with Firefly actor Alan Tudyk, Serenity is the first film in a three-picture Firefly contract with Universal Studios."

entertainment,"Television A spokesperson stated on Monday that UK television company ITV have been fined A$3000 (about US$2591 or £1663) for cruelty to animals in an incident on programme ""I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!"", where two celebrities killed and ate a rat. The incident involved actor Stuart Manning and television chef Gino D'Acampo, who went on to win the ninth series of the programme, which was broadcast in 2009. Inside the jungle, having been reduced to rations of beans and rice, the two celebrities caught a rat before killing it and then cooking it, to give the beans and rice ""more protein"", before eating the rat, which contestant and actor George Hamilton described as ""actually quite nice"". Inside the programme's video diary room, at the time of the recording of it, Gino D'Acampo said: ""I saw one of these rats running around. I got a knife, I got its throat, I picked it up."" RSPCA Australia had stated that performing an act like this on television was ""not acceptable"". Initially, Manning and D'Acampo were charged for animal cruelty. However, their charges were dropped when ITV made the confession that production staff had allowed the celebrities to carry out the act of killing the rat. After a court trial in Sydney, Australia, ITV got a fine of A$3000. The company also had to pay costs of A$2500 (US$2192 or £1396). An ITV spokesperson said that ""ITV has apologised for the mistake which led to this incident. The production was unaware that killing a rat could be an offence, criminal or otherwise in New South Wales, and accepts that further inquiries should have been made. This was an oversight and we have since thoroughly reviewed our procedures and are putting in place a comprehensive training programme to ensure that this does not happen in future series."""
entertainment,"TV star Fern Britton is in talks with producers about appearing on BBC One show Strictly Come Dancing. She was best known for being co-presenter on ITV1's This Morning — and is set to make her TV comeback on the hit show. She has been offered Brendan Cole as her dance partner. One TV source has mentioned that there are many incentives for Fern to appear on the dancing show, including losing weight and also being offered a whole host of TV and magazine deals. The Strictly Come Dancing production team are keen to attract more viewers on this year's series — especially as the programme will be going head-to-head with the new series of ITV1 hit singing show The X Factor, which appeals specifically to the 16–30 year old viewing market. The BBC has yet to confirm or deny any contestants on Strictly Come Dancing."
entertainment,"One week after the eleventh-hour renewal of the American soap opera Days of our Lives, NBC, the network airing the series in the United States, has let it known that the renewal has come at a price, namely a lower one. As a result of further cost-cutting measures to keep the show afloat through September 2010, two of the longest-running actors on the serial have had their contracts severed. Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn, who have played the characters of Marlena Evans and John Black for decades, have taped their final episodes and have been officially released from their obligations at Days of our Lives. When contacted by Wikinews, Days publicist Daniela Mancinelli commented ""Days of our Lives has decided to rest the characters of 'John Black' and 'Marlena Evans.' After a year of separation, 'John' and 'Marlena' will finally reunite before exiting the canvas in early 2009."" The surprise renewal of the serial and the high-profile terminations come at an awkward time for the show, because, despite improving on ratings numbers this year and being the only soap opera not to lose viewers, it was highly expected that the series would simply end its run once its contract ran out in March of next year. In early 2007, at a fall preview unveiling for reporters, NBC president Jeff Zucker made a statement indicating that the show would not be renewed past 2009. The renewal was apparently contingent on lowering overall budget numbers, which includes either lowering salaries for actors or terminating them completely. One actor, Jay Kenneth Johnson, who plays the character Philip Kiriakis, left of his own accord earlier this week after being asked to take a voluntary pay cut in exchange for a contract renewal. Longtime fans of the series are upset at the cast upheaval, with The Tampa Tribune noting loud fan protest on message boards devoted to the drama series. The New York Daily News told readers that next week there will be more news about the current budget situation facing the series, and more potential cast layoffs to be announced. Days publicist Daniela Mancinelli, after being contacted by Wikinews, said that she does not comment on the status of actors' contracts."
entertainment,"The Sesame Place theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania opened for its 2007 season this morning, adding Abby Cadabby to its all-star lineup of characters that children can meet. Described as a ""sweet, inquisitive enthusiastic three-year-old fairy-in-training"" who loves making new friends, the character stars in a musical show called Abby Cadabby's Treasure Hunt. Featuring all of the stars of Sesame Street, the production joins Elmo's World Live: Fishes. Abby was not the first recurring female character to be introduced to Sesame Street since 1993, as press materials for season 37 of Sesame Street proclaimed; Phoebe and Googel from the short-lived Monster's Clubhouse segment both hold that title. She is however the first new female character since 1993 to show any lasting power. Her performer, Leslie Carrara, says Abby will appear in ""almost every episode next season"". The Langhorne, Pennsylvania attraction was opened in 1980, sparking robust commercial development in the town. While similar parks have opened in Irving, Texas, Tokyo, Japan, Monterrey, Mexico and São Paulo, Brazil, none of them managed to strike the hearts and minds of tourists. Roller coaster Super Grover's Vapor Trail, the Sky Splash water ride, and the ""Rock Around the Block"" musical parade all return for the 2007 season, as do other rides, shows, and physical play activities. The park is open Friday through Sunday until 25 May, when the park begins opening daily. After Labor Day, Sesame Place is open weekends only until 27 October 2007."

entertainment,"Legendary R&amp;B singer Fats Domino has been accounted for, three days after Hurricane Katrina hit in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. Fats Domino was found on Monday by a helicopter searching for residents stranded in floodwaters. He was identified by his daughter from a photo taken Monday by a New Orleans Times-Picayune photographer. However, while it is known that Domino was rescued, his whereabouts and the whereabouts of his family are not immediately clear. The singer had told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He had not been heard from since before the storm hit. Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit. Antoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, ""The Fat Man"". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous Top 40 singles, perhaps his most notable were Blue Monday and a cover of Blueberry Hill. Domino retired from touring in the 1980s, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or an invitation to the White House were able to get Domino to leave the town."
entertainment,"Ian Alleyne, host of Trinidad TV show Crime Watch, has been charged with crimes under the Sexual Offences Act after a tape purporting to show a mentally ill teenage girl being raped was allegedly broadcast last year. The footage allegedly was on-air thrice last October and triggered multiple complaints to police. Caribbean Communications Network's (CCN's) channel TV6 is jointly charged under the same act as Alleyne, as well as under the Telecommunications Act. Summonses were served at their Port of Spain headquarters. Alleyne was placed in custody in the same city. Alleyne has been hospitalised following his arrest, owing to chest pains. He is due to go before a magistrate, and cannot receive bail until he does so. He is also charged with obstructing police. Police had visited CCN offices in Port of Spain twice last year seeking the tape. Alleyne issued a message to The Trinidad Express criticising the decision not to grant him bail until he appears in court. He said it ""is really a sad state of affairs on the part of the police. What have I done that they have seen it fit to ensure that I'm only granted bail before a magistrate?"""
entertainment,"In the United Kingdom, The Carphone Warehouse, Celebrity Big Brother's sponsor, has pulled out after some of the reality TV show's contestants were accused of racism, with which the company did not want to be associated. The Perfume Shop has announced they will withdraw the perfume Shh... of Jade Goody, one of the contestants accused of bullying with a racist undertone. Motorcycle insurance company Bennetts unilaterally terminated its deal with former Miss England Danielle Lloyd to front an advertisement campaign. The accusations centre around recent comments made by Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara (a former member of pop act S Club 7) about Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. The racism row was sparked by Jade's mother, who referred to Shilpa as ""the Indian"", instead of calling her by her name. She also asked Shilpa: ""Do you live in a house or a shack?"" There have been remarks over her accent, her alleged lack of hygiene when cooking, and reactions because she touched the food of housemates with her hands. Danielle Lloyd said: ""You don't know where those hands have been."" Lloyd also commented to Goody about the Indian actress: ""She wants to be white"". When asked about the incident in the Diary Room, Shetty said ""...I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end. I think there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial."" Hertfordshire Police, the constabulary within which the Big Brother House falls, have received numerous formal complaints they will be investigating. Politicians, other celebrities, and fans spoke of their disgust as the UK media regulator Ofcom received a record number of complaints that rose tonight to 33,000. The Commission for Racial Equality is investigating if the footage was manipulated to deliberately imply racism. Labour Party MP Keith Vaz even proposed a motion in the House of Commons condemning the abuse. He said ""If this racist behaviour goes on, they Jo O'Meara, Danielle Lloyd and Jade Goody should be asked to leave"". Chancellor Gordon Brown, currently on tour in India, told reporters in Bangalore: ""I want to reassure people that what British people are proud of is our reputation for tolerance and fairness."" Others believe this reflects a racist tendency in British our Western society in general. The newspaper Times of India ran the headline ""Big(ot) Brother bullies Shilpa"". ""What is happening in Big Brother is just holding the mirror to the western society. This is the real, discriminating face of the West."", was the reaction of Bollywood film director Mahesh Bhatt. Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, accused Channel 4 of damaging the country's reputation.

His “Gold Digger” featuring Jamie Foxx vaulted 19-1 on the chart, ending Mariah Carey’s 14 non-consecutive week reign with “We Belong Together”. “Together” drops to No. 4 on the Hot 100. The 19-1 rally makes it the fifth biggest gain to No. 1 in Hot 100 history. The song also gains a record 94-2 on Billboard’s Pop 100 chart kept out of the No. 1 on that chart by the Pussycat Dolls with “Don’t Cha”. Mariah Carey is still No. 2 with “Shake It Off”. “Shake” was widely expected to gain to the Hot 100 pole position this week.

entertainment,"Few artists ever penetrate the subconscious level of American culture the way RuPaul Andre Charles did with the 1993 album Supermodel of the World. It was groundbreaking not only because in the midst of the Grunge phenomenon did Charles have a dance hit on MTV, but because he did it as RuPaul, formerly known as Starbooty, a supermodel drag queen with a message: love everyone. A duet with Elton John, an endorsement deal with MAC cosmetics, an eponymous talk show on VH-1 and roles in film propelled RuPaul into the new millennium. In July, RuPaul's movie Starrbooty began playing at film festivals and it is set to be released on DVD October 31st. Wikinews reporter David Shankbone recently spoke with RuPaul by telephone in Los Angeles, where she is to appear on stage for DIVAS Simply Singing!, a benefit for HIV-AIDS. ---- DS: How are you doing? :RP: Everything is great. I just settled into my new hotel room in downtown Los Angeles. I have never stayed downtown, so I wanted to try it out. L.A. is one of those traditional big cities where nobody goes downtown, but they are trying to change that. DS: How do you like Los Angeles? :RP: I love L.A. I’m from San Diego, and I lived here for six years. It took me four years to fall in love with it and then those last two years I had fallen head over heels in love with it. Where are you from? DS: Me? I’m from all over. I have lived in 17 cities, six states and three countries. :RP: Where were you when you were 15? DS: Georgia, in a small town at the bottom of Fulton County called Palmetto. :RP: When I was in Georgia I went to South Fulton Technical School. The last high school I ever went to was...actually, I don’t remember the name of it. DS: Do you miss Atlanta? :RP: I miss the Atlanta that I lived in. That Atlanta is long gone. It’s like a childhood friend who underwent head to toe plastic surgery and who I don’t recognize anymore. It’s not that I don’t like it; I do like it. It’s just not the Atlanta that I grew up with. It looks different because it went through that boomtown phase and so it has been transient. What made Georgia Georgia to me is gone. The last time I stayed in a hotel there my room was overlooking a construction site, and I realized the building that was torn down was a building that I had seen get built. And it had been torn down to build a new building. It was something you don’t expect to see in your lifetime. DS: What did that signify to you? :RP: What it showed me is that the mentality in Atlanta is that much of their history means nothing. For so many years they did a good job preserving. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a preservationist. It’s just an interesting observation. DS: In 2004 when you released your third album, Red Hot, it received a good deal of play in the clubs and on dance radio, but very little press coverage. On your blog you discussed how you felt betrayed by the entertainment industry and, in particular, the gay press. What happened? :RP: Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. ‘Betrayed’ alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don’t feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. :But, I don’t know what happened. It seemed I couldn’t get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals. DS: Do you mean as court jesters? :RP: Not court jesters, because that also plays into that mentality. We as humans find it easy to categorize people so that we know how to feel comfortable with them; so that we don’t feel threatened. If someone falls outside of that categorization, we feel threatened and we search our psyche to put them into a category that we feel comfortable with. The mainstream media and the gay press find it hard to accept me as...just... DS: Everything you are? :RP: Everything that I am. DS: It seems like years ago, and my recollection might be fuzzy, but it seems like I read a mainstream media piece that talked about how you wanted to break out of the RuPaul 'character' and be seen as more than just RuPaul. :RP: Well, RuPaul is my real name and that’s who I am and who I have always been. There’s the product RuPaul that I have sold in business. Does the product feel like it’s been put into a box? Could you be more clear? It’s a hard question to answer. DS: That you wanted to be seen as more than just RuPaul the drag queen, but also for the man and versatile artist that you are. :RP: That’s not on target. What other people think of me is not my business. What I do is what I do. How people see me doesn’t change what I decide to do. I don’t choose projects so people don’t see me as one thing or another. I choose projects that excite me. I think the problem is that people refuse to understand what drag is outside of their own belief system. A friend of mine recently did the Oprah show about transgendered youth. It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar. We’ll learn the difference to that. One of my hobbies is to research and go underneath ideas to discover why certain ones stay in place while others do not. Like Adam and Eve, which is a flimsy fairytale story, yet it is something that people believe; what, exactly, keeps it in place? DS: What keeps people from knowing the difference between what is real and important, and what is not? :RP: Our belief systems. If you are a Christian then your belief system doesn’t allow for transgender or any of those things, and you then are going to have a vested interest in not understanding that. Why? Because if one peg in your belief system doesn’t work or doesn’t fit, the whole thing will crumble. So some people won’t understand the difference between a transvestite and transsexual. They will not understand that no matter how hard you force them to because it will mean deconstructing their whole belief system. If they understand Adam and Eve is a parable or fairytale, they then have to rethink their entire belief system. :As to me being seen as whatever, I was more likely commenting on the phenomenon of our culture. I am creative, and I am all of those things you mention, and doing one thing out there and people seeing it, it doesn’t matter if people know all that about me or not. DS: Recently I interviewed Natasha Khan of the band Bat for Lashes, and she is considered by many to be one of the real up-and-coming artists in music today. Her band was up for the Mercury Prize in England. When I asked her where she drew inspiration from, she mentioned what really got her recently was the 1960’s and 70's psychedelic drag queen performance art, such as seen in Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis, The Cockettes and Paris Is Burning. What do you think when you hear an artist in her twenties looking to that era of drag performance art for inspiration? :RP: The first thing I think of when I hear that is that young kids are always looking for the ‘rock and roll’ answer to give. It’s very clever to give that answer. She’s asked that a lot: ""Where do you get your inspiration?"" And what she gave you is the best sound bite she could; it’s a really a good sound bite. I don’t know about Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis, but I know about The Cockettes and Paris Is Burning. What I think about when I hear that is there are all these art school kids and when they get an understanding of how the press works, and how your sound bite will affect the interview, they go for the best. DS: You think her answer was contrived? :RP: I think all answers are really contrived. Everything is contrived; the whole world is an illusion. Coming up and seeing kids dressed in Goth or hip hop clothes, when you go beneath all that, you have to ask: what is that really? You understand they are affected, pretentious. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s how we see things. I love Paris Is Burning. DS: Has the Iraq War affected you at all? :RP: Absolutely. It’s not good, I don’t like it, and it makes me want to enjoy this moment a lot more and be very appreciative. Like when I’m on a hike in a canyon and it smells good and there aren’t bombs dropping. DS: Do you think there is a lot of apathy in the culture? :RP: There’s apathy, and there’s a lot of anti-depressants and that probably lends a big contribution to the apathy. We have iPods and GPS systems and all these things to distract us. DS: Do you ever work the current political culture into your art? :RP: No, I don’t. Every time I bat my eyelashes it’s a political statement. The drag I come from has always been a critique of our society, so the act is defiant in and of itself in a patriarchal society such as ours. It’s an act of treason. DS: What do you think of young performance artists working in drag today? :RP: I don’t know of any. I don’t know of any. Because the gay culture is obsessed with everything straight and femininity has been under attack for so many years, there aren’t any up and coming drag artists. Gay culture isn’t paying attention to it, and straight people don’t either. There aren’t any drag clubs to go to in New York. I see more drag clubs in Los Angeles than in New York, which is so odd because L.A. has never been about club culture. DS: Michael Musto told me something that was opposite of what you said. He said he felt that the younger gays, the ones who are up-and-coming, are over the body fascism and more willing to embrace their feminine sides. :RP: I think they are redefining what femininity is, but I still think there is a lot of negativity associated with true femininity. Do boys wear eyeliner and dress in skinny jeans now? Yes, they do. But it’s still a heavily patriarchal culture and you never see two men in Star magazine, or the Queer Eye guys at a premiere, the way you see Ellen and her girlfriend—where they are all, ‘Oh, look how cute’—without a negative connotation to it. There is a definite prejudice towards men who use femininity as part of their palette; their emotional palette, their physical palette. Is that changing? It’s changing in ways that don’t advance the cause of femininity. I’m not talking frilly-laced pink things or Hello Kitty stuff. I’m talking about goddess energy, intuition and feelings. That is still under attack, and it has gotten worse. That’s why you wouldn’t get someone covering the RuPaul album, or why they say people aren’t tuning into the Katie Couric show. Sure, they can say ‘Oh, RuPaul’s album sucks’ and ‘Katie Couric is awful’; but that’s not really true. It’s about what our culture finds important, and what’s important are things that support patriarchal power. The only feminine thing supported in this struggle is Pamela Anderson and Jessica Simpson, things that support our patriarchal culture."

entertainment,"Ren and Stimpy. Bugs Bunny. Philip J. Fry and Professor Hubert Farnsworth on Futurama. Sparx. Bi-Polar Bear. Popeye the Sailor Man. Woody Woodpecker. You may not think you have ever heard Billy West, but chances are on a television program, a movie, a commercial, or as Howard Stern's voice guru in the 1990's, you have heard him. West's talent for creating personalities by twisting his voice has made him one of a handful of voice actors—Hank Azaria and the late Mel Blanc come to mind—who have achieved celebrity for their talent. Indeed, West is one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. What is the fulcrum in Mr. West's life that led him to realize a talent to shape personalities with his voice, and how did the discovery of that gift shape him? Wikinews reporter David Shankbone found that like many great comedians, West faced more sour early in life than he did sweet. The sour came from a physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic father (""I could tell you the kind of night I was going to have from the sound of the key in the door or the way the car pulled up.""), to his own problems with drug and alcohol use (""There is a point that you can reach in your life where you don’t want to live, but you haven’t made the decision to die.""). I’m telling you stuff that I never said to anybody... If sin, suffering and redemption feel like the stages of an endless cycle of American existence, West's own redemption from his brutalized childhood is what helped shape his gift. He performed little bits to cheer up his cowed mother, ravaged by the fact she could not stop her husband's abuse of young West. ""I was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times, and I would come in and say stuff, and I would put out little bits just to pull her out of it."" But West has also enjoyed the sweet. His career blossomed as his talent for creating entire histories behind fictional characters and creatures simply by exploring nuance in his voice landed him at the top of his craft. You may never again be able to forget that behind the voice of your favorite character, there is often an extraordinary life. Below is David Shankbone's interview with renowned voice actor Billy West, who for the first time publicly talks about the horrors he faced in his childhood; his misguided search for answers in anger, drugs and alcohol; and the peace he has achieved as one of America's most recognizable voice actors. interview David Shankbone: You’re known for speaking about the use of famous actors to do voice-over. What is your central problem with their use? :Billy West: My problem is that if they were judged by the same standards we were, that we have to try and get work with, they would be pretty piss poor as voice performers. DS: What standards are those? :BW: The standards are that you have a really special voice that you can go around and do that voice and make a living that people just instantly love it. Nobody is just instantly in love with the usual suspects. Voices that we see in the cartoon movies now. DS: Like Robin Williams? :BW: No, he's different, he understands character. I mean he understands characterization and voice changes. And so does Mike Myers and so does Eddie Murphy. DS: Jerry Seinfeld as well in Bee Movie? :BW: No, that’s not it because he‘s doing a character that looks exactly like him and sounds exactly like him. I mean, Will Smith does characters that are drawn to look like him and sound like him. I wish I had that luxury. Nobody draws a character that looks like me and sounds like me for me to just step in and be the perfect person for the role. You know what I mean? DS: What’s the solution? Not to do characters around stars? :BW: The thing is, I don’t have an issue with the fact that these movies are being made. If I could audition for them and I didn’t get them, I still wouldn’t have an issue with them. But this is the thing: they audition us for these movies and then they play it for the A-list people, for these celebrities, so they can strip my talents’ abilities and kind of toss them over to the celebrity just to make it look better than it would be. And I’m not a teacher. Not a paid teacher. I don’t like that stuff. West on laying down cartoon characters in auditions, only to have a celebrity end up doing the voice with the quirks West's voice introduced. DS: They’ll have you come in, or someone of your caliber come in, and actually shape the voice around the character and then they’ll present it to the celebrity as the template? :BW: Yeah, and sometimes you’ll actually hear stuff that you actually thought of during the audition, because you have to really be on your toes. DS: Are you paid for that? :BW: Not really. Only a couple gigs did I ever get paid to scratch a movie for a celebrity that was going to do it. The stuff that goes on at auditions is despicable. DS: Are there legal remedies that you could pursue for that? :BW: No. I gotta prove it. I used to bring a tape recorder around with me, but still, it’s like trying to fight city hall. It is what it is. But that’s my real issue with it is that this is an Area 51 for experienced voice-over people who do create characters and not just do who and what they are. It takes away from the creative process. DS: There was a similar issue involved with Crispin Glover. They had taken a likeness of one of his earlier roles. I think it was Robert Zemeckis Then they tried to pass it off later as him and he sued them for doing that. Are you familiar with that situation? :BW: It only means anything to me if he won. DS: He did. :BW: Oh, he did! That’s very similar. But the thing is, if you could prove that. You can’t prove that somebody deliberately took the stuff and tossed it off to some person that’s acting. But it’s a dirty business and I won’t do it anymore. I never really quite got what it’s all about. It’s to show up and to sound exactly like the character and to read it, yet you’re doing it the way that you would do it. It’s not good business as far as I’m concerned. It’s not my part of town. DS: Has your speaking out on this issue hurt you in any way? :BW: In what way? DS: In your career? :BW: No. DS: There’s no reaction against it from the studios or from the ….? :BW: No they don’t give a shit which voice-over person is in the alleyways beating the piss out of the other one to get a gig. I mean, they don’t care. They really don’t. DS: You discussed in an interview issues about the weight of the character’s legacies, such as Pop-Eye or Bugs Bunny. You had said that every time they do one of these they say, 'this time it’s going to be different. We’re putting the teeth back in those characters. Nobody is going to tell us what we can’t write and what we can write.' And you said they always blow it. How do they blow it? :BW: They pander. Slowly they take away the aspects of what made those characters who and what they were. In other words, cartoons contained sometimes gratuitous violence with the squash and stretch animation. Sometimes it was gratuitous. But that was only an aspect of the cartoon. When you start stripping away those things that made it a full dimension character, you’re going to have Xeroxes of it in every way including creativity. The worst mistake Warner Brothers ever did was make all these characters friends, because then you took away the dynamic. Elmer wanted to kill Bugs Bunny. There was no question in anybody’s mind. Sylvester wanted to kill Tweetie. There was no question in anyone’s mind, unless you wanted to say, “He just wanted to eat him. He didn’t want to kill him.” Go figure that out. There was danger involved, and some life truths involved. When you’re telling the truth, you’re really dealing with comedy. If you don’t have the truth on your side, then comedy can’t spring from it, unless you have some weird hydroponic garden that doesn’t need any of the standard things that it takes to grow something. DS: How do you choose a project, or does the project choose you? :BW: It works both ways. I get offers for stuff. If it looks like a good offer, I’ll take it. I’m not a snob. I love working, and every now and then somebody will say, “Why did you do that?” You know what? It’s none of your business. All I owe you is a good performance. DS: Where do you think voice acting is going? It doesn’t seem like it’s ever an art that’s going to lose its place, but do you see it diminishing? Is it on a downturn? Is it on an upturn? Is it idling? :BW: What they’re doing slowly is they’re going to have to turn the celebrities and actors into cartoons, slowly but surely, because it’s the look that people are seduced by. It’s almost as if they like watching animation more than they do live action because of all the farms of kids being fostered to love computer-generated images. If you don’t do this, if you don’t start turning all of the celebrities into cartoons, we’ll lose our star system. It’s better to have their likenesses with their voices rather than trying to act out something that sprung from someone’s imagination that needed a concerted effort to give it a voice, a look. These characters are actors, they look like themselves, but they’re doing it with cartoon and computer processing. This is where it’s going. DS: With computer animated voices? :BW: No, no, no. The stars will never go away. Let’s start there. If they have to become cartoons they will, because it’s a trend in the industry that these kinds of movies make more money than the regular ones do, for the most part. And they have no use for people that can create any kind of a character that’s shaped to whatever you want. That’s not useful in this case. DS: Do you remember a time in your life when you started recognizing your talent for being able to shape your voice into memorable characters? :BW: I never really noticed. It was just so natural to me. What I used to do was hide it because no one would say anything. When somebody’s mind got blown around you, they just resented you or would find a reason to not like you. What happened was, I grew up thinking that everybody could do it, but that they were just too cool to do it. DS: You had a talent that seemed very trite to you, but very few other people could do it and you didn't recognize that? :BW: Yeah. I didn’t even think that it was something that was gifted upon me. I mean I never thought of it like that. I thought everybody was exactly the same. And then I would hear that nobody was doing the kinds of thing that I did and I began to feel weird and I retreated for various reasons. If I showed up at a softball game I started calling the plays like an old-time sportscaster. You would think people would like that. But it would be met with, 'Who do you think you are?' DS: You would feel a compulsion to do the plays in a voice? :BW: Yes. And I definitely wanted to get approval. Every kid wants that. But I would do those things because I heard the radio and I would listen to what people actually had to say. I just had my own approach to everything. Every little town weirdo like me grows up to come to the Mecca of weirdos, which is Hollywood. DS: I’m not a voice actor, but there’s times I’ll hear a person say a phrase. I covered the Iranian president speaking at Colombia for Wikinews and I watched these dueling ideologues who were normal citizens. One of them was this large black woman with a Bible yelling at this secular Jewish guy. I recorded these voices. She had one of those voices that I just couldn’t get out of my head. She just kept going, “You’re evil. You’re going to burn in Hell.” I found myself saying it aloud over and over and over again because her voice and what she said made such an impression on me that I wanted to imitate it. There was such a history behind that voice. She probably could have just said, “Buy Tide detergent,” and I would still be saying it over and over and over again. :BW: Sure. That’s what I mean about some people having naturally quirky voices. You’ve heard people in your life, like you meet a girl, a full-grown woman, who goes in high pitched squeal, “I wanted to ask you.” And you go, 'Drop the act. Is this a put-on?' And I go, “Shit, you should be doing cartoons!” DS: Is how you developed your talent when you were younger based upon imitating others? You would hear things that would leave impressions on you and you would want to imitate them? But why would you want to imitate them? :BW: Because I had no role models. My dad was a certifiable psycho and he made my life a living hell and it was a horror chamber where I grew up and when I grew up. The guy used to beat the daylights out of me left and right, for any random reason. He was a raving alchie. I grew up with him making fun of me. I was forced to retreat into a world where I couldn’t get hurt or beat up or anything like that. Billy West on beginning to do voices DS: It was escapism ...? :BW: Well yeah. You gotta understand, it was like I was a little kid. I’m not a magical being. My dad tried to kill me about fifteen times. DS: So when you would escape into those voices, you felt a sense of safety? :BW: Yes. 'Cause I was surrounded by things that wouldn’t be a threat to me. DS: And things that you could control through your own voice. :BW: Yes. DS: Whereas you couldn’t control what an alcoholic authority figure was going to do. :BW: I was like an alien; I was an observation unit, trying to study the human condition, not consciously, but because I had to. I could tell you the kind of night I was going to have from the sound of the key in the door or the way the car pulled up. I was hyper vigilant. So all I was, was this unit from space that had nothing but data gathering and sensory equipment. DS: What was your dad’s reaction to your doing voices? :BW: It didn’t register on the radar because, number one, I wasn’t really doing it in the time I spent with him. The other thing was that he was a frustrated talent. He could sit down at the piano and just start playing it, having no lessons or training. He could do dialogs and he could do voices. He was very funny, you know, among his friends and all that. He was also a musician, a drummer. And I became a musician except I wasn’t a drummer, I was a guitar player. The thing is, he could never make it pay. All he had was a string of jobs. Driving a beer truck then driving a soda pop truck then driving an ice cream truck. You know what I mean? Like a Ralph Kramden kind of thing. DS: Where was your mom during all this? :BW: She was trying to make a household and trying to keep the place as sane as she possibly could. DS: It doesn’t sound like she was very successful. :BW: She had to leave him. She came into the sixth grade one day. I saw my mother at school and I was mortified like any other kid would be. She talked to the teacher and they went out in the hall. My mom came and I went with her to the airport. It was like going on a trip. We got out of Detroit, Michigan and we were on a plane to Boston. Me and my two brothers. One was a baby and the other one was like, gosh, he had to be seven or six because I was about eleven. This was back in 1963. DS: When did you come to a realization that your voice was something that you wanted to turn into a career? West on abusing animals to deal with his own abuse :BW: It never was a realization. I started playing trumpet in grade school when I was ten years old and I liked the idea of going on stage and playing. And I was in a couple of plays in school and I really liked that world. I felt totally at home with it cause you had to be ready for anything and you had to be vigilant and you had to be on your toes, which actors need as skill and survival tools. So it was the perfect place for me to be. It’s not like I was a hollow, empty vessel. I had plenty of things percolating inside and all that, but I needed to be where I to be where I felt good and I never fit in with other kids. I only had, like, two friends, maybe one, who was, “You like that comic book too?” You know, that kind of stuff. Getting called faygot by any random goon. DS: Did you say fay or faggot? :BW: No, it’s faggot, but they would pronounce it fay-got, you know, in Boston. Faygot. What are you, faygot? What are you, queer? DS: Do you think that’s had any lasting effect on you? :BW: Well, I can now get crazy without being angry or raging because I know how to do it. Everything you do has to come from something real. You have to tap into something. Otherwise, there’s nothing to grab hold of if you’re a watcher or a listener or whatever. There’s nothing for you there. It’s no fun for the audience. DS: They say that all great comedians typically have extraordinary tragedy in their lives, and they develop their humor as a response to it. :BW: Yes, but I developed mine a lot of the times to comfort my mom. Because she saw the way I was being treated. Not so much my brothers, but I was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times, and I would come in and say stuff, and I would put out little bits just to pull her out of it. DS: Even though you were hurting, it would hurt you to see her hurting over you. :BW: Yes. And you know, I could take a beating. I finally learned how to just galvanize myself where you just totally like disassociate and your body can sit there and get smacked around and punched or whatever and your mind is a million miles away. DS: What made you the whipping boy? :BW: Well my dad was very very angry. He was abused as a child and he lived in a matriarchal situation with his mother and her sister and then her mother and there were all these big German …. I don’t know, like real staunch people, angry and punishment-inclined. He liked to dish out punishment …. DS: What would make you the one that he would unleash that upon as opposed to your brothers? :BW: Because I could do little things that he seemed to be threatened by. DS: Like what? :BW: I could draw. He was an artist. I could pick up a pen and start drawing immediately. He was a musician, a drummer. Then, I learned to play guitar when I was ten years old. He didn’t sit right with any of these things. Plus, he was very jealous of me because my mother loved me more than him. DS: An oedipal issue? :BW: Well, yeah, but it happened from Day One. He resented eventually the fact that I was born 'cause I took away his mommy. DS: What is your relationship with your brothers like? Did they see this going on? Did they feel bad for you? :BW: Only my other brother. He's dead now. He bore witness to an awful lot of stuff and he, himself, was the brunt of an awful lot of stuff that I teased him and bothered him, 'cause it trickled down. DS: You said your father was a victim of abuse himself and that pattern often repeats. How did you stop that pattern? Was it through your voice work? :BW: No, not really. I had a mean streak. But I’m such a dyed-in-the-wool animal lover. I’ve always had pets. I would be so filled with anger and rage that on my way to school, it was literally a “kick at the cat” as they used to say. You’re angry and you don’t know where to direct it. You’ll kick a wall that has wet paint on it. That’ll teach them. And hurt yourself doing it. I’d go out and kick the shit out of some little cat or something, just like you know, smack it. You know, go over and go to pet it, then whack it because that’s all I knew. In a weird way, in a weird permutation of the whole situation, to me that was supposed to be love. Cause why would your parent hit you, hurt you? Why? It never makes sense to a kid. And they all used to say, “It’s because I care about you.” But I got over that stuff and what I did was start to hurt myself. DS: How so? :BW: I started drinking and doing drugs when I was about 21. I was playing in a band and it was all part of the picture, you know. It could be rosy for you. You couldn’t survive anywhere else, but in a band you were like golden. I used to punch walls, cause ruckuses and get into fights wherever I went. You know, throw things at people. DS: How did you stop the fights and the drugs? :BW: I had to go to rehab. I had a job in radio. I stopped playing music. I tried to do some standup comedy, but I don’t have the discipline for it. I used to just go out there and not care if I died or lived or whatever. You know, I’d just say stuff. I was always searching. I just couldn’t go up there and do twelve minutes and pretend like I’d just thought of it, you know, for three years. DS: Are you still sober? :BW: Oh yeah. I’ve been sober for 22 years. But I had to go into rehab. I had a series of car accidents. I almost got killed one night but I just walked away from it chuckling, smashed. West on his wilder days. DS: Were you at a point where you didn’t necessarily want to die, but you just didn’t care if you lived? :BW: That’s pretty much it, yeah. You put your finger on it. There is a point that you can reach in your life where you don’t want to live but you haven’t made the decision to die. DS: Whatever happens happens. :BW: Yeah. You let the wind blow you around. I have a zillion stories. I should write a book. These are stories that you think, 'No, that couldn’t be true. That couldn’t possibly be true.' I was in radio around the same time too. I went back to playing music in the early eighties after a hiatus. I started playing again with a couple of people and I was also working radio but I was in a constant blackout. And people said I was good on the radio. I don’t know what I did or said. I just used to come in there and turn the place upside down. I was too good to fire. But they didn’t know what to do with me, you know. I’d come in in the middle of a night— DS: And that would almost egg you on? :BW: No, no. It wasn’t that. They wouldn’t just grab me and throw me up against a wall and say, “Listen, you little fuck, you’re going to rehab.” I got away with this kind of behavior and it was awful because I was terrorizing people. Not during the day. At night. And stories. There would always be stories and then it would make the papers. You know, that kind of stuff. I finally cracked up a car and I was in for non-payment of rent and the judge says, 'I don’t care about this non-payment of rent thing, but you’re doing a week in Charles Street Jail for this DWI that you never answered for.' This was before the advent of computers. Now, they press a button and it spits out everything. But back then, you could screw up in one town and then go to another town and do exactly the same thing and they could never put them together because everything was on paper. DS: Now it’s all electronic. :BW: But I wasn’t proud of that. That was the lowest point of my life. But I’ve been sober for longer than I was a user. Twenty-two years. DS: Are you in some way glad that you went through the drug and alcohol abuse? :BW: I could ask you the same thing and I don't mean to pull a ""Donald Rumsfeld,"" interviewing myself. But I could ask you the same thing. Are you glad? Because if you are where you are and it seems okay, then you had to have gone through those things for you to be the total sum of your experiences which led you to the very spot and the very phone you’re talking on. You know what I mean? And so it’s almost like no matter what you did, if you finally get yourself together and you mean well and things are going okay, it’s like, 'Well, it had to be that way.' The universe obviously had to teach me something. DS: Do you believe in a higher power? :BW: Yes I do. I don’t know what it is. I just think its some higher form of energy and some sort of being, but I can’t embody it in my mind. But I know I have a one to one, kind of a spiritual connection to whatever that is. See I was raised, I had Catholicism shoved down my throat. I was an altar boy. I knew the mass in Latin. DS: Me too. :BW: Really? DS: I didn’t know the mass in Latin, but I was an altar boy and I had Catholicism shoved down my face, but I’m 33, so Vatican II had happened. :BW: Yeah, and then you get ""Father PreCum"" trying to give you a massage and shit like that. DS: The priest at my church got a nun pregnant and my mother, who was the president of the PTA at my Catholic grade school, helped deliver the baby and keep the whole thing hidden. :BW: Really? DS: Yeah. And he’s still the priest. :BW: I think it’s probably a guy masquerading as a nun, if you’re talking about priests. DS: Where do you see yourself now in your career? :BW: Exactly where I want to be. You know, I feel bad for kids who want to be voice-overs. They will always be needed. I always encourage them. They’re always going to need what you offer. And you can make a living if you’re really good. But there’s only so far you can go now. Before, the sky was the limit. There wasn’t these rigged fights standing in your way. 'Cause right now, it’s like a rigged fight. You can still audition and get great satisfaction on the job as a voiceover. And that’s all I ever really wanted to be. :But I did aspire to do animations that required voice work. And I’ve done some of it and then this trend set in. And believe me we don’t get the kind of money those people get for doing voices. It’s rather odd to me. At some point I realized many years ago—I was a teenager in the sixties, protesting with the long hair, running around with the hippies—I realized when I looked at all the guys we were supposed to hate so much and resent, I kind of analyzed what complacency was, and they seemed complacent to me. They reached a point in their lives where they felt good about themselves and just cause a bunch of kids come along that were popping drugs and accusing you of this and that and being the man and everything, you think your feelings states are never going to change. And I used to say they’re complacent. But the thing is that everybody that’s born pretty much has to reach that point where they’re looking down the barrel of their own complacency. You gotta like do a little gear shifting. DS: At what point was that for you? :BW: When I stopped drinking, of course. But I couldn’t play music in the way I wanted to play it anymore. I would have been like a parody of myself. So that didn’t seem truthful to me. Trying to do comedy seemed truthful to me, but then, like I told you before, I didn’t have the discipline to do stand-up. That term wasn’t popular much before the seventies. Then you started hearing these stand-up comics. When I was a kid and when I was a teenager, doing comedy meant you were interrupting somebody’s dinner in a restaurant. There was no comedy clubs per se. But the turning point—it’s called survival. It’s like being a cockroach. You evolve or die. When I was kid I thought everybody was like me and all these people I hang with are going to be running the country and I couldn’t have been more wrong. continued from previous section DS: Well they are. It’s just things have changed. :BW: I’m way older than a lot of these guys by the way, that are out there. But to me they look like old men with bad breath and dandruff. DS: Who are you talking about? :BW: Republicans. DS: Yeah. :BW: You know, the guys that are running things. They don’t look like people that came from my generation at all. I’m as old as Karl Rove, or any of those idiots and it’s like, 'Where did you come from?' It’s still the same old geezers that hide behind religion and family values, and then they’re messing with guys in men’s rooms and scandal prone because that’s sort of what the party is famous for. I hated those guys and I didn’t grow up to be one. But then I watch all these people from my generation just suddenly morph into that and I’m still in a state of shock. Where did these Donna Reeds and these little Breck girls, St. Pauli girls that are filled with Republican ideology come from? It’s like they’re young. What is this, you know. DS: It’s confusing because you look at somebody like Dick Cheney, who has this lesbian daughter, who’s in a gay marriage Poe and Cheney have not entered into a formal union - ed and now has a baby with her partner, and you just don’t know how the situation exists. It’s hard to comprehend. That Mary Cheney exists in the Republican party, and that she seems to be fine with that existence and even works for it. :BW: I know, it’s almost like it shouldn’t be possible, yet it is. And these guys are thumping their chests about it. I don’t go for that. It’s like saying you don’t approve of who and what your daughter is by birth. I’ll never understand that. And, again, Cheney is only like six or seven years older than me. You know what I mean? Like where the f did this shit come from? DS: Has the Iraq War affected you much as a person? :BW: Yeah, totally. I watched the whole Vietnam thing go down and it’s the exact same thing. You think we would learn, but we don’t because the proof of that is there’s Holocaust deniers to something that happened a couple years before I was born, that there was extermination. Now there’s people that aren’t sure whether that happened or not, no matter how many shoes are piled up and down in Washington, D.C.. DS: Teach the controversy. Make it appear there are two sides to every fact. :BW: Yeah, but there ain't two sides to science. And when you start banning science and real knowledge, then you’re in George Orwell land. The pretense of it all really bothers me. I hate sitting there, talking to a guy that’s looking me right in the eye, and he’s lying to me. I hate when adults play pretend. I hate it more than anything. The only time I want to play pretend is when I can play like a child and not make it into an ideology. I know I go way off the subject, but I have a lot to say and a lot of people say, as far as the animation and the celebrities and all that, you know, I’m not so outspoken. Maybe not everybody talks about it, but what am I going to do? It’s the truth. DS: Do you think we live in a fear-based society now? :BW: It’s no secret to anybody, unless you fell off a potato truck somewhere. Back-street America. DS: What is the reasoning behind questions like, 'Aren’t you afraid of saying such-and-such thing?' :BW: Because the person is usually fear-driven himself and totally understands the consequences of telling the truth. You don’t get rewarded for it, let’s put it that way. DS: Are you optimistic? :BW: I’m optimistic about my own life and things changing for the better. I don’t pin my existence on the industry. I really don’t. Some people, without their fame, they would just roll up into a ball and bounce away and I’m like a reluctant famer, if you know what I mean. Celebrity means nothing to me. The word means nothing to me. I don’t know if I said this. I probably already did because I’ve been talking so long. But if you fart the national anthem you can be a celebrity. It’s bloodless. It’s artless. It’s Godless. But, fuck, that’s what people want. And the idea that the word celebrity and the word diva has been watered down into any girl with a belly button now and some gold chain around her neck can be a diva. It doesn’t matter why they call the great talents divas, you know women in the theater. It’s a pass-fail society. It’s like, in my opinion, the guy that can fart the national anthem and is famous is totally equal to someone else who actually has talent and worked their ass off and became famous for having a gift. But it can be debated. It’s like you’re saying there’s good art and bad art. Then there’s like, well define art. It’s endless. It’s infinite. DS: And you think that they are equal? :BW: No, of course not. DS: You’re saying in today’s culture they are equal? :BW: Both can be famous. That’s not the kind of fame that I would want and the other kind of fame is a certain flavor of misery too because there’s a trade-off that you lose your personal life. I spent enough time in the fantasy world. I don’t watch reality shows. These are the kind of people I couldn’t wait to get away from in high school and I’m going to chronicle their stupid adventures, you know? I don’t live there. I don’t watch television. DS: I don’t have cable, so I know how you feel. :BW: Yeah, but even if I had cable, satellite, everything, I don’t watch television. I surround myself with things that edify me, not because it’s there. I’m an information freak. I’m a news freak. But it’s got to be truthful news and that’s why I’ll go to the BBC News on the Internet. There’s less pressure with the truth teller over there. DS: It’s amazing when you hear the BBC interview British politicians. We find it shocking that they’ll say things like “Aren’t you essentially lying when you say that?” :BW: But that was the Fourth Estate. That was the idea that you owe your readers. You’ve been entrusted to deliver news to them and even if it’s an editorial or an interview, the idea is to get as much true information so people can decide for themselves. I don’t care if the interviewer’s biased. If I get enough information, I have a chance to be biased or not. DS: That's an argument on Wikipedia: people make the argument, 'let's present the information out there and let the reader decide. :BS: Yeah, but if a lot of times the information is totally incorrect to begin with. DS: Exactly,and it can be difficult to decide what to believe when reasonable minds can differ, but I think it's very problematic to ever argue ""just let the reader decide."" I don't know if Wikipedia is the place for that fight, but in the news media, that is the place for the fight. I interviewed Gay Talese, who quoted Norman Mailer who said the media is like a donkey, and you must feed the donkey every day; the donkey will eat anything: garbage, tin cans, slop. And report on whatever they are fed. DS: Are your voices an attempt to understand reality? :BW: Well yeah. All I was presented with was life as it was deconstructing and disintegrating. And I had to pick up whatever pieces I had off the floor and try to put it together in a way that made sense to me. I don’t know if I’m making myself all that clear. Billy West DS: No you are. :BW: Yeah, I’m telling you stuff that I never said to anybody. DS: Well it’s good. :BW: You’re like the Barbara Walters of your generation. And I’m not going to protect an image I don’t really have. Nobody wants to hear what I really think about politics. I totally understand it. It’s like, every night is opening night if you’re a performer. Okay that’s done. Now what? I mean if everyone had to answer that standard in their job. ""Now what are you going to do?"" Because I don’t get told what to do. I audition for everything because if you want to work you’ve got to audition. Some people call me out of the blue and say, 'We just want you,' which is very nice and I worked really hard for that status. But I still audition for everything. There’s a show coming up called Rahan and there’s a 26 episode commitment on that. I’ll be starting that soon. I can’t tell you much about it because I’ve only read the auditions, the lines I was supposed to do. And the other thing is Futurama is going to keep me busy for awhile even though all the voice-over work is done. There’s lots of projects that are related to it. And I’m still doing the M&amp;Ms. I really love what I do and I don’t want people to think I’m sitting here angry all the time. I’m absolutely happy and I like what my life has become. But I still will start feeling weird if somebody asks me a question and I can’t tell the truth about it. I’m just telling it like it is. DS: That's perfect. I will send you a link to the interview when it is published. :BW: That would be fine. I’d appreciate it. There's so much wrong on Wikipedia, like that I got booted off the Stern show. I feel a lot of dehumanized lie dispensers get a hold of these things and just make it so. Believe me, there’s this very small but very active group of posters that want to keep dancing in the pet cemetery with animal corpses. DS: It doesn’t say anything negative about the Stern show. It just mentions the characters that you did and that you were on there. And the only thing it says is that “Billy has since claimed that he left the Stern show because WXRK management refused to give him a sufficient pay raise.” :BW: Yeah. That’s the real reason. That’s cool. They finally got that in there. For a while there it was like, He was going to be Invader Zim, but he didn’t make the cut. He wasn’t Invader Zim and somebody else was. That’s so stupid to me. Rick Horowitz was a friend of mine. He was better at it than I was. That’s a fact of life. Instead of printing what I didn’t do. I mean, there should be a link to the list of voice credits, if you can find one. You know a complete one. DS: There’s a link to your official web site on there. And there’s also a link to Voicechasers database and a link to Internet Movie database and a link to an interview with you on CNBC. :BW: Oh. The Donny Deutsch interview. That was weird too. I mean I really love Donny Deutsch, but he kept asking, 'What it’s like making all of this money?' Because that’s what the show is. It’s about finance or something. I mean, I know the guy. I actually used to work for him because he had Deutsch Advertising, when I was doing commercials. But he had to keep the money thing going because that’s the channel basically. His show was about that and I was embarrassed. I mean, now that you’ve got millions because we know that you’re working. I’m in the same boat you are Donny. As far as your house goes, you want what’s yours and what touches yours to avoid encroachment. And it’s never enough because fate keeps throwing stuff at you and nobody knows what it’s like to pay a seven figure tax, in quarters over a year. You wind up about the same except that you have more stuff than most people."
entertainment,"BBC In the United Kingdom, the BBC has received in excess of twenty-one thousand complaints after Jeremy Clarkson, the presenter of BBC television programme Top Gear, made an appearance on the live BBC programme The One Show and made comments about the UK public sector workers on strike, which British trade union UNISON subsequently called ""appalling"". The BBC and Jeremy Clarkson both apologised after the comments were made. During the programme, Clarkson commented on how the strikes on Wednesday were ""fantastic"" as they had left the British capital London ""empty"". It was ""like being back in the 70s"", according to Clarkson. He went on to caution that ""we have to balance this though, because this is the BBC"" before saying of the striking public sector workers: ""Frankly, I'd have them all shot. I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families. I mean, how dare they go on strike when they have these gilt-edged pensions that are going to be guaranteed while the rest of us have to work for a living?"" Immediately after the remarks were made, The One Show presenters clarified that these comments was personal opinion, to which Clarkson replied: ""They're not. I've just given two views for you."" Presenter Matt Baker apologised about the comments before the end of the broadcast. In the aftermath of the broadcast, by yesterday morning BBC Audience Services were contacted in relation to the matter 21,954 times, with 619 comments and 21,335 complaints amongst them. Clarkson was supported in 314 messages. A spokesperson for the BBC confirmed that the The One Show episode would not be made available to view on BBC iPlayer, the BBC's on-demand service, because the episode generated so many complaints. The British prime minister described the comments as ""silly"", while saying he was certain that Clarkson ""didn't mean it"". According to The Guardian, Clarkson had reportedly spoken with the production team before the live broadcast about using strike-related humor. What do you make of Clarkson's comments? Thursday, the BBC apologised for the comments, as ""the item was not perfectly judged"", the corporation admitted. In a statement the same day, Clarkson said: ""I didn't for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously – as I believe is clear if they're seen in context. If the BBC and I have caused any offence, I'm quite happy to apologise for it alongside them."" The presenter also clarified to British newspaper the Daily Mirror: ""I expressed two different views. Which one do I apologise for? I am just making fun of the BBC's need to be impartial. Not about strikers. I wasn't saying that strikers should be shot."" UNISON, a trade union in the United Kingdom, called the comments ""appalling"" and initially wished for the BBC to remove Clarkson from his position. Karen Jennings, the deputy general secretary of the UNISON, subsequently told the BBC that the trade union ""accepted the apology"" before going on to say: ""He's recognised that he went too far in saying what he said and what we're doing now is extending our hand to him to come and work with a healthcare assistant to see just how they work and the healthcare they deliver. I think he would enjoy that."""
entertainment,"Finnish folk metal/viking metal band Turisas have released their first music video and second single, a cover version of the Boney M. 70s disco hit Rasputin. The Turisas version of the song was released as a single, on September 21 in Germany, to be followed by France, the United Kingdom and various other territories on September 24, Spain on September 25 and finally the band's native Finland on September 26. At each release, it will be available as a CD, which will feature the band's song Battle Metal, from the album of the same name as a B-side, and as a limited edition picture 7” vinyl record featuring In the Court of Jarisleif from the album The Varangian Way as a B-side. Band frontman Mathias ""Warlord"" Nygård explained the concept behind the video: ""This video is pretty far from what you'd expect from a Turisas video - or any metal video for that matter! The idea to the video is just as wild as the cover song itself: a battle metal band covering a 70's disco hit. Just as the song, it is a crossover of the 70's kitsch attached to the Boney M. track, but performed by us as we do it. Director Vesa-Matti Vainio and the whole crew did a great job on this one and to me, this is a good pick for our first video ever. I assure you, there are plenty of ideas on epic spectacles to be looked into later.” He goes on to explain how the unusual cover came to be in the first place: ""We've been begged to record Rasputin pretty much since we first played it live a couple of years back. It's amazing how popular this cover version of ours have become at our gigs during the last year and it really makes us feel like we must have done something right here looking at big crowds going totally mental over a 70's disco hit! I remember getting the idea for this cover years back - in 2001 I think. I was on a ferry trip between Finland and Sweden and there was this cover band performing 70's disco hits. The minute they blasted 'Rasputin' I knew, that at some point, we would need to do it in some form or another. It was just obvious that it would work amazingly well given a slightly more modern and heavier touch-up. Personally I've always preferred these old 70's disco bands""."

entertainment,"British television host Richard Whiteley, most famous for his role presenting the British television game show Countdown, has died aged 61 at Leeds General Infirmary. The cause of death is reported to have been complications resulting from an operation on his heart to repair an infected valve. He had been admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary with pneumonia on May 6, falling into a coma shortly there after. His 23 years of hosting Countdown made him a household name among television viewers in the UK, having previously anchored Yorkshire's Calendar local affairs program.

entertainment,"A Dutch reality TV show broadcast yesterday evening which was designed to show a terminally ill woman choosing a patient to receive her kidneys has been shown to be a hoax. The Big Donor Show had attracted considerable condemnation earlier in the week when outline details had been released. The producers said that the programme was made to highlight the shortage of Dutch donors. The ""donor"", known only as ""Lisa"", was an actress, although the three individuals competing for the kidneys are real patients requiring kidney transplants. The choice was to have been made based on the history and profile of the ""contestants"" and conversations that the actress is indicated to have had with their families and friends. Viewers were also invited to send in their advice by text message during the programme. At the point in the show when the choice of recipient was to have been revealed, the show's presenter Patrick Lodiers revealed that the exercise had been a hoax. ""We are not giving away a kidney here, that is going too far even for us,"" he said. Political parties in The Netherlands together with medical organisations and kidney specialists had united in condemning the programme prior to its broadcast. Joop Atsma of the ruling Christian Democratic Party had said ""It's a crazy idea. It can't be possible that, in the Netherlands, people vote about who's getting a kidney."" Professor John Freehally, immediate past President of the UK Renal Association stated that ""the scenario portrayed in this programme is ethically totally unacceptable"", continuing that the show would cause confusion and anxiety rather than contributing further to an understanding of transplants. He also pointed out that the set up of the programme bears no relationship to the processes for making decisions about transplants in normal circumstances. However, speaking after the broadcast, Dutch Minister for Education, Culture and Science Ronald Plasterk, claimed that the show was a ""fantastic stunt"" and kidney patient Caroline Klingers watching the programme at a treatment centre in the town of Bussum praised it saying that it would be ""good for the publicity and there are no losers"". Speaking at a news conference after the programme, a producer said ""We have only done this cry for help because we want to solve a problem that shouldn't be a problem"", and this view was underlined by presenter Patrick Lodiers who claimed that it was ""reality that was shocking"" in that about 200 people die in the Netherlands each year waiting for a kidney where the average waiting time is more than four years. Bart de Graaff, the founder and former director of the TV station which broadcast the programme, died from kidney failure at the age of 35 after spending years on a transplant waiting list. The programme was made by Endemol, the company which makes Big Brother and which is not immune from criticism. On Wednesday of this week it was required by UK regulator Ofcom to broadcast an apology for its handling of potentially racist material involving Indian actress Shilpa Shetty in the January 2007 Celebrity Big Brother in the UK. Ofcom had received a record number of 44,500 complaints."

entertainment,"Legendary musician Sir Paul McCartney has boycotted China in response to a preview of BBC news footage that was filmed undercover at a fur market in Guangzhou, China. The footage, some of which is to air during BBC's Six O'Clock News at 18:00 GMT on November 28, 2005, shows animals (particularly dogs and cats) being thrown from the top of buses and being dropped into boiling water. McCartney's wife, Heather, also watched the footage and alleged that some footage she had seen clearly showed that the animals were alive when they were skinned. The footage, which was filmed by an investigator connected to the animal rights group PETA, shows cats squirming in a bag before being thrown into boiling water, and then skinned in a laundrette drier-like machine. McCartney slammed the practices, saying, ""It's like something out of the Dark Ages. And they seem to get a kick out of it. They're just sick, sick people,"" referring to the apparent smiles and laughter of the workers handling the animals as they are killed. He and his wife called for a boycott of Chinese goods, adding that this was unacceptable behaviour from the nation to host the next Olympics. However, the Chinese Ambassador to London's spokesperson said that China is not to blame. ""The fur trade mostly feeds markets in the US and Europe. This fur is not consumed in China. So the Americans and Europeans should accept the blame."""
entertainment,"wikimediaMention The newly elected Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation scheduled talk on the main French TV was met with questions about a last minute deletion of the entry for bravitude, (a neologism used by Ségolène Royal, the French socialist presidential candidate and commonly heard in the French media). It was deleted from the French version of Wikipedia not long prior to the televised appearance by Devouard. The decision to delete the entry apparently perplexed the anchor commentator, who judged the term was currently noteworthy and felt his view was shared by many Frenchmen today. Chair Nibart-Devouard then explained that since Wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers, its articles can be and are edited by almost anyone with access to the Web site. Therefore any article, including one on bravitude, can be added to this Wiki encyclopedia... but the article can be modified or even deleted if the verification process leads to a consensus to do so. One might speculate whether the French media interest in the French Wikipedia's deletion of the term bravitude will result in sufficient discussion to warrant this neologism being restored to the French Wikipedia."

Herbert said in an interview on Voice of America's Our World, a science and technology program, that ""Using everyday equipment made it something that children should not be afraid of.

TV3, the official RWC television broadcaster for New Zealand, described Sky's actions as illegal and unethical. MediaWorks, which runs TVWorks and RadioWorks, filed the injunction against Sky in Auckland's High Court today saying it breached fair dealing practices over its use of Rugby World Cup footage. Sky is now temporarily banned from screening TV3's WRC footage on The Cup, Rugby Highlights (channel) and Sport 365 Highlights. An agreement between MediaWorks and other broadcasters, including Sky, was signed allowing content to be used for news purposes, but state Sky breached the agreement and used content of which it had no right to. Bill Ralston, former head of news and current affairs at TVNZ (Television New Zealand), said when they had 2003 Rugby World Cup rights, ""TV3 pushed the boundary by taking a bit more than they should."" The three networks usually pushed the rules but the boundaries were relaxed. ""Simply because Sky controls so many sports rights themselves, you can normally get a good quid pro quo out of them. You relax a bit, they relax a bit."" The TVWorks Chief Operating Officer said, ""We are simply acting to protect our interests, and the interests of the viewing public."" Rick Friesen said, ""We believe Sky’s behaviour to be unethical and illegal, and we will be taking whatever action we can to protect the interests of ourselves and every Rugby fan in New Zealand."" An undisclosed amount of money was paid to secure the rights to screen footage, beating TVNZ and Sky. It has been rumoured the cost is to be in the millions of dollars (NZ$). Sky is yet to make a comment on this action. A full hearing on the injunction will occur on Friday."

entertainment,"New Zealand New Zealand's new digital free to air television platform, Freeview was 'switched on' today at the Auckland Museum by the Government. This is the beginning of digital, and within 10 years, analogue transmission will be switched off for good. Broadcasting minister, Steve Maharey said that it may take time for people to be persuaded to change to Freeview, but says changing to it is necessary. He describes Freeview as the path to a digital nirvana. Broadcasting spokesperson for National Dr Jonathan Coleman says that the Government was told that, for Freeview to work, quality content was needed, otherwise people wouldn't see a need to change. Before the launch of Freeview, the only way New Zealanders could watch digital TV was to subscribe to the only pay TV operator, SKY Network Television. Viewers who have bought the required NZ$300 set top box can only watch TV ONE, TV2, TV3, C4, and Māori Television. Radio New Zealand National and Radio New Zealand Concert are also available on Freeview to listen to. The most notable exception from the current line up of channels is SKY's free to air channel, Prime. There is a possibility for an extra 13 channels to be added at a later date. State broadcaster, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who owns TV One and TV2, announced earlier that they will be launching two new channels. One will carry family, arts and entertainment type programmes and the other will be a news and current affairs channel. The former will be launched later this year, and the latter being launched next year. As well as the $25 million the Government has already contributed to Freeview, TVNZ's new channels will be given $79 million over five years. Various local broadcasters are also worried how they will survive when the analouge transmission is turned off. The Regional TV Broadcasters Association Chairman Jim Blackman has estimated the cost for regional broadcasters to be up to $1 million annually. He says the Government needs to help these broadcasters for them survive. ""Every New Zealander can now receive digital television with no monthly fees and no contracts. They simply purchase a Freeview satellite set top box, and if they need one, install a dish, and their favourite television programmes are free,"" Freeview General Manager, Steve Browning said. Freeview terrestrial transmission will start sometime next year. Controversy has been thrown up recently that Sky has told its contractors not to help install set top boxes for Freeview. SKY refused to comment to Radio New Zealand about this. Mr Browning said that the launch is as significant as the launch of colour television was 30 years ago."
entertainment,"Obituaries Two-time Emmy Award-winning American-born actor, Patrick McGoohan, famed for his role as Number Six in the 1960s cult British television series The Prisoner, has died at the Saint John's Health Center, Santa Monica, California. He died on January 13, following a short illness at the age of 80. McGoohan's death was made public by his son-in-law, film producer Cleve Landsberg. Born in New York City, and raised in the UK and Ireland, the actor played in numerous series on both continents. Aside from The Prisoner, his notable roles were in the ITV network series Armchair Theatre and Danger Man. McGoohan was also considered for the role of the iconic spy James Bond. It is for the series The Prisoner, filmed in Portmeirion, North Wales, that he will be best remembered. The show's tagline, ""I am not a number, I am a free man!"" emphasised the primary focus of the series, McGoohan's escape from his captor, ""Number One"". McGoohan leaves behind his wife Joan Drummond McGoohan, three daughters, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild."

entertainment,"Radomil. For the first time after the fall of the iron curtain Russia will host the Olympic Games – in 2014 the Winter Olympics will take place in Sochi, a Black Sea resort town. The games are considered a matter of national prestige and generate more media attention than the recent changes in Russian government (Russia’s Putin recently installed the new prime-minister, who, incidentally, also became the chair of the Russian Olympic committee.) As Russia takes enormous efforts to prepare for the Olympics and build a modern sport infrastructure from scratch, the Russian public is more concerned with the mascot for the upcoming games. When Moscow hosted the Summer Olympics in the 1980, the mascot for the Moscow Games was Misha the Bear, developed by children’s book illustrator Victor Chizhikov. Misha instantly became a graphic-design hit, especially in the Soviet bloc. Olympic posters were snatched up and t-shirts were fought over. And as Sochi is set to become the new Olympic city, Russians are keen to see the old bear return. There is a long way to the Sochi Olympics, but the Bear is already coming back from retirement. Russia! magazine, an English-language publication distributed in the US and the UK, has commissioned the most prominent designers and artists to do their own renditions of the famed mascot. “The Olympic Bear turns any Russian between the ages of 25 and 50 to quivering jelly. Our artistic compatriots were happy to whip the old bear into shape for 21st century use” – says Ilya Merenzon, the magazine’s publisher. “And the readers’ response was overwhelming. As soon as the new issue arrived at the stores, we constantly get emails requesting the Bear t-shirts. The animal is regaining his popularity”. – adds Merenzon. It has not been decided, however, on the Sochi Games mascot. Another option is Cheburashka, a famous Russian cartoon character with big ears and humble smile. Cheburashka was the mascot for the Russian Olympic team in Turin and is one of the best-selling children’s toys in former USSR countries and, surprisingly, Japan, where it is known as “Chebu”."

entertainment,"The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Internet file sharing networks can be sued for copyright infringement. The decision in the case ""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. et al. v. Grokster, Ltd. et al."" had been much awaited by those on both sides of the debate about copyright law and its application to Internet technologies. The court ruled that businesses created with the purpose of letting users commit copyright violations should be held liable for the infringement. Writing for the court, Justice David Souter wrote: ""One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device's lawful uses."" The strength of the decision was unexpected &amp;mdash; this is the first major Internet copyright case to reach the Supreme Court in many years, and the Justices' unanimity sends a strong message about their lack of tolerance for companies designed to violate the law. The decision affects such companies as Grokster and StreamCast, both of which were defendants in this suit. The court's ruling does not have an immediate effect, however, as the Justices referred the decisions to a lower court to be reconsidered. Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney for the EFF, panned the court for not providing a clear test for what constitutes inducement, saying it would discourage innovators unsure of their project's legality. He did however remain optimistic about Grokster and StreamCast's chances in the lower courts."
entertainment,"Wikinews held an exclusive interview with Jeremy Hanke, editor of MicroFilmmaker Magazine. The magazine, which is free to read online, was started as a resource for the low budget moviemaker and features book, independent film, equipment and software reviews as well as articles on film distribution, special effects and lighting. He says that one of the goals of the magazine is to ""connect low-budget filmmakers via a feeling of community, as many.....often compete so viciously against one another in film festivals for coveted ""shots"" with Hollywood, that they can quickly forget their similarities."" When asked if films made on a shoestring budget can really compete with those made for millions of dollars, he replied, ""no…yes…and absolutely. Allow me to explain."" And so he does in the interview below. Wikinews (Joseph Ford)Why was MicroFilmmaker Magazine started? How does it help the thousands of independent filmmakers out there with big ideas and little cash? : Mr. Hanke: As a budding low-budget filmmaker at the beginning of the new millenia, I found that it was very hard to find anyone who had practical articles on making films as professional as possible with little money. Most of the video and film magazines would talk about equipment that could range from $10,000 - $30,000 apiece, which clearly was out of the $7K budget for my first film, which had come from scrimping and saving while working as a commissioned computer salesman. As I did more research, I discovered that statistically, as many as 70%-80% of all Indie films were being made for less than $30,000, which, obviously, my first film’s budget definitely fell into. Hollywood considers anything below $100,000 to have such a low budget that it’s considered a no-budget film. Because of that low regard, no one was wasting their time making magazines or websites designed to help these less-than-no-budget filmmakers, despite the fact that they were (and are becoming even more) the majority of filmmakers in the world. : With no publicized help, I made my first two feature films over the course of four years with XL-1s and other equipment borrowed from local colleges, utilizing helpers that were of extremely varied experiences and drive. In the process, I learned a pile of things through hard knocks. : After these films were mostly completed, I remember looking online for any new sites that might have cropped up devoted to low-budget filmmaking. That’s when I found some devoted to microcinema—a boutique-style of video-making that’s largely composed of home videos and short parodies that are meant to be shared with friends and neighbors. The term originated in San Francisco and was designed to be similar to the micro-brewery movement, which encouraged home brews that were shared in communities. The concepts of a community of sharing and the emphasis on low-budgets were an encouragement for us, but most microcinema never tried to look professional or strove for high standards, so it fell short of the sort of help I was looking for. : Shortly after that, I found a company called Redrock Micro, which had built a 35mm lens adapter for less than $1K which allowed low-budget filmmakers to get film-like depth of field from $2000-$4000 cameras and SLR lenses. This was about 15 times cheaper than the closest competitor from P+S Technik. Not only that, but they had such a passion for low-budget filmmakers, that they were offering kits with plans and a key part so you could build your own 35mm adapter for $45. I was so blown away by an equipment manufacturer caring that much about low-budget filmmakers that it inspired me to create the first magazine aimed specifically to help other ultra-low budget filmmakers who had to struggle as much as I did. : As you can imagine, the name “MicroFilmmaker” came from a combination of the word “Microcinema” (with its low budgets and community approach) and Filmmaking (which we specifically chose over “videomaking,” because we feel that filmmaking is able to be accomplished with any medium, since “films” are a product, not a recording medium). : As I inferred, I wanted to connect low-budget filmmakers via a feeling of community, as many low-budget filmmakers often compete so viciously against one another in film festivals for coveted “shots” with Hollywood, that they can quickly forget their similarities. (We also wanted to remind them that low-budget filmmakers actually substantially outnumber their counterparts in Hollywood, which can be an amazing source of power if we all work together, rather than in isolated groups.) The best way we saw to do this was by providing a vast resource library of articles on low-budget filmmaking with a serious eye for stretching a dollar, in-depth reviews of software and equipment specifically evaluated from a low-budget perspective, DIY tutorials on building helpful equipment, listings of special readers-only discounts of different products, and an area for finding fully deferred musicians and score composers for your films. : Of course, one of the most unique things at MFM is something no other magazine offers: in-depth critiques of current low-budget films by trained low-budget directors and producers to help filmmakers become better at their craft. This last piece of our magazine’s offerings is the only thing that we charge any money for, because it is so specialized to a specific filmmaker’s film. (Although there is a charge, the amount is no more than the cost of a submission to a film festival with shorts running $25 and feature-length films running $50, which is used to provide a small reimbursement to the critic for their hard, detailed work and is substantially less than the $300-$500 most film analysis companies charge.) : With this publicly viewable critique service, we’ve had films submitted from every continent (with the exception of Antartica sic). Filmmakers have ranged from total film beginners to former Hollywood people who’ve become passionate about low-budget filmmaking, which is a really awesome swath of filmmaking humanity. It’s always cool when we’ll have a filmmaker submit a film that has problems and then, after the critique, change their approach for the next film so that the upcoming film has a much better score. We’ve had filmmakers jump from relatively low scores with one film to getting our coveted “Best of Show” award with the very next film. J.F.MicroFilmmaker Magazine is free to read on its website. Why did you choose this over the paid subscription route? : Mr. Hanke: There were so many scams on the internet that were designed to prey on filmmakers, that we didn’t want to make low-budget filmmakers—who had the least money to spend on making their films in the first place—have to pay to get the information to make their films the best they possibly could be. I and a number of my top writers are believing Christians and we wanted this magazine to be an act of service to the low-budget filmmakers, not a money-making scam. Clearly our readers have found it to be useful, because many people who have very different beliefs and values than we do regularly frequent our magazine’s pages and have asked for our help with all processes of filmmaking—even on films that are violently anti-Christian. We don’t turn away anyone that needs help and do our best to help in any way we can. : This is also the reason we chose to make MFM an exclusively online magazine. Because of its online nature, our operating costs are lower than they would be if it were printed, which allows us to survive on online advertising without having to charge our readers a dime. Additionally, while printed magazines can be more lucrative (even the ones that are paid for by advertising and not by subscription fees), they would not be able to reach the web’s global population of filmmakers that need help. J.F.Today, most of the films we see in theatres cost millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, to make. Do you think it's really possible to make films that can compete with these on a shoestring budget? : Mr. Hanke: I would say no…yes…and absolutely. Allow me to explain. : Can you get the same quality of image on a $5,500 Panasonic HVX200 as you can get off a $120,000 Grass Valley Viper? No, of course not. There are all sorts of compression and quality differences between the affordable cameras and the ones that Hollywood uses. (However, this is becoming less and less the case with the extremely popular wild-card camera company, RED. They’ve made a higher-quality-than-Hollywood camera in the Red One for about 1/10th the cost of a comparable Sony camera that Hollywood use. Additionally, they’re about to release an even less expensive camera in the Red Scarlet, which will be unveiled at NAB ’08.) : Now moving on to the “yes” part. When you take out the image quality differences, the amount of leaps in software and compositing abilities that are now available to the shoestring budget filmmaker are amazing. For example, there is now extremely powerful greenscren software that’s designed to allow you to key DV and HD footage and yields quite nice results. (I’m actually in the process of working on a book on this subject, and have found the growth in this area really impressive.) Additionally, a number of special effects programs either have been created for low-budgets, like VisionLab by FXHome, or have dropped their prices for low budget users, like Apple’s Shake, which dropped from $3,000 to $500. Many of these programs allows you to create everything from blaster fire to lightning and composite them in one place. And, for folks who want to use Hollywood quality particle effects, the quite impressive particleIllusion is only $300 and was recently used in the new Rambo film, as well as being used in many other Hollywood productions. : In addition to the software improvements, the 24fps recording of cameras like the DVX100 and the HVX200 when combined with the shallow depth-of-field created by the Redrock Micro M2 and other 35mm lens adapters gives digital filmmakers a way to create an amazing filmic look—even if they can’t do it with the really expensive cameras we mentioned earlier. : Finally, the “absolutely” part. The most powerful thing that allows low-budget filmmakers to compete with Hollywood films is content. The fact that so much quality filmmaking gear can be had at such a low prices means that anyone who is willing to put in the work to write a good script and shoot it well can have a film that can gain a following. Some of the best TV shows I have seen of late could easily have been shot as a low budget film. (For example, much of CBS’ Jericho, which might have been the most creative show to be introduced in the last twenty years, could easily have been shot on a shoestring budget as a film.) J.F.Distributing a movie can be one of the hardest aspects of production. Do you think that today, with the Internet, it's easier to go about doing this and make a profit than it might have been twenty years ago? : Mr. Hanke: Actually, yes I do. Today, something like 50% of all Indie films turn a profit. However, considering that many of the films that are made are still extremely esoteric avant garde art films, you can probably estimate that 70-80% of films that deal with any form of readily accessible narrative can turn a profit. (This is the huge advantage of shooting a $10,000 no-budget film as opposed to a $200 million Hollywood film. The $200 million Hollywood film has to sell $400 million in tickets to turn a profit, to cover both the production and advertising budgets. The $10,000 film often only has to sell $15,000 worth of DVDs, Amazon UnBox viewings, and art house shows to turn a profit.) : One of the easiest ways to take advantage of the internet to make your film profitable is to use the CreateSpace service (which used to be CustomFlix and is now owned by Amazon). They allow you to upload your entire film and high-rez cover art and then they just print a copy whenever someone orders it from Amazon.com or your website, issuing you a percentage without you ever having to buy pre-printed copies to sell. Additionally, they will let you create a rentable or purchaseable download of your film through the Amazon UnBox service, which further enables you to get your film out there and make it profitable. (Just remember to make a sexy website with a trailer for your film to encourage people to check it out. If you want a Flash site but aren’t Flash savvy, the new Adobe Encore CS3 actually has some very powerful abilities to create a professional Flash website with only your DVD menu creation skills required.) J.F.Do you have any advice for the amateur filmmakers reading this? : Mr. Hanke: Of course. Some of these may sound like blatant plugs, and I suppose they are, but they are the actual pieces of advice I would give (and have given) to a new filmmaker. : 1. Audio may not show up in your video monitor, but it is easily the most important part of your film. Make sure you understand that and use a decent shotgun mic to get clean dialogue, or you will be killing yourself in post. (We have a number of articles on audio, mic positioning, and ADR s at MFM.) : 2. Start with a short film. If you have a feature length film you’re dying to do, shoot a scene of it as a short first. This will allow you to make your mistakes on a film that hasn’t eaten up years of your life. (For example, if you screw up the audio I mentioned in #1, it’s a whole lot easier to redub a 5 minute film than it is to redub a 110 minute film. Been there, done that; please don’t make the same mistake!) : 3. Read through all of the s of MFM, as we have tried to cover the better part of four years of low-budget film school for free and have endeavored to make it easy to find things. (Additionally, read the critiques of other people’s films, even if you haven’t seen them, as you can often avoid a lot of first time mistakes by reading our detailed commentaries on these films.) : 4. After you’ve done all you can to preplan, just do it—and give yourself permission to make the mistakes you undoubtedly will. : 5. Finally, when you’ve edited it to the best of your ability, send in your film to be critiqued by MFM. There’s something about submitting your film to a place where it will be publicly analyzed that proves to someone that he/she really want to grow as a filmmaker. Once that fire’s in you, you won’t settle for making a film that isn’t an improvement over your last one."
entertainment,"Finland now holds the world record for the longest non-stop round of karaoke singing. The country already holds the record for the largest number of karaoke singers at any given time. The previous record was 145 hours, as held by China. However, in a karaoke bar in Kouvola, a small town on Finland's southern coast, the record was surpassed on Wednesday, with the ultimate goal being 240 hours non-stop. Finns travelled long distances to participate at the event, which was broadcast live on the internet. The record goes alongside Finland's other record for karaoke, that of the largest number singing at any given time.

entertainment,"As the World Turns, the longest-running soap opera on American television, was canceled Tuesday by CBS, the network which has aired the show since its first episode in 1956. This news comes just three months after the ending of Guiding Light, formerly the longest-running soap in radio and television history, which had entertained generations of Americans for seven decades. In the announcement, Barbara Bloom, senior vice president of daytime programing at CBS, wrote, ""It's extremely difficult to say good-bye to a long-running series that's been close to our hearts for so long...The almanacs will show As the World Turns as a pioneer of the format, a hallmark for quality with its numerous Emmys, the launching pad for many television and film stars and a daytime ratings powerhouse for parts of three decades."" The cancellation comes at a particularly bad time not only for the people involved with producing the soap, but also for the soap opera industry in general. With the cancellation announcement, the number of daytime soap operas on the air in the United States will shrink from seven to six. By comparison, there were 12 soap operas on the air in 1997 and 19 in 1973. While the revelation may have hurt, it was not entirely a surprise. The ratings for the soap opera have fallen to 2.5 million viewers, over 60% from 1993, when the show was watched by 6.5 million viewers daily. Soap Opera Digest editorial director Lynn Leahey said not to call for the death of the genre; its next act may prove more profitable on the Internet. ""It has to be turned into a business model. I do think there's huge potential there. I think if we can deliver the content where people are instead of expecting them to sit in front of their TVs, there's hope,"" Leahey said. The news was taken particularly hard at As the World Turns Brooklyn studios, where the building was closed off to press on Tuesday. ""We are disappointed and saddened by the news that the show is not being renewed. It will certainly be a loss for all of us, and for the show's loyal audience,"" said executive producer Christopher Goutman in a prepared statement. ""It's a hell of a Christmas present,"" said actress Eileen Fulton, whose spitfire character Lisa was an integral part of the canvas in the show's top-rated years in the 1960s and 1970s. ""I'm just very sad. I'm sad for all of the people who work out there in Brooklyn. We're a family. I hate to be split up. It's like a divorce."" The series, which focuses on the lives, loves and torments in the small Midwestern town of Oakdale, will have a nine-month swan song; the final episode will not be airing until September 2010. Until that time, Procter &amp; Gamble's TeleNext Media will be trying to find a new home for the show, either on another television network or online. If As the World Turns leaves the air entirely, Procter &amp; Gamble, the company which coined the term ""soap opera,"" will officially end its 76-year partnership between its cleaning products and the dramatic medium."

In an interview with Tony Blair, he asked Blair whether he prayed with US president George W. Bush.

In the interview, she talks about her sexuality and romance with comedienne and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. The 32-year-old Australian reveals she recently told her 98-year-old grandmother that she was a lesbian, when visiting back home. Supposedly her grandmother had a change of heart after two minutes, accepting De Rossi's sexuality. DeGeneres and De Rossi met at an awards show in December 2004, and both immediately broke up with their respective partners. In the May issue of Allure magazine, DeGeneres said she hopes that she and De Rossi ""are together for the rest of our lives."" The interview also reveals she turned down lesbian roles, including one opposite Angelina Jolie in a movie called Gia. De Rossi says she is now fine playing gay characters, but will not do sex-scenes, gay or straight. On why she suddenly feels comfortable on publicly speaking on the topic, ""I was thinking, well, the people who need to know I'm gay know, and I'm somehow living by example by continuing on with my career and having a full, rich life, and I am incidentally gay, but it's not a big political platform. I justified it in so many ways."" Another probable reason she consented to the interview is its timing, right before the upcoming season debut of Arrested Development."

entertainment,"Obituaries British actress Natasha Richardson has died, according to a statement released by a spokesperson. Richardson died after suffering a head injury from a fall, while she was receiving private skiing lessons at a Canadian resort in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. She was 45 years old. ""Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time,"" said a spokesperson for Richardson in a statement to the press. It was reported Tuesday that Richardson was brain dead and had been transported by plane from Sacré-Cœur Hospital in Montreal, Canada to a care facility in New York City in the United States. Despite the fall, which happened on Monday, witnesses say she did not appear to have been seriously injured. Richardson was not wearing a helmet. An hour after the fall and after she returned to her hotel room, Richardson began to feel ill and was taken to a local hospital. She was later transported to Sacré-Coeur Hospital. Richardson made her movie debut in 1986 when she starred in the motion picture Gothic. In 1988 she was cast as the starring role in the film Patty Hearst. She also co-stared in the films Nell and the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. She also won a Tony Award in 1998 for her portrayal of Sally Bowles in the acclaimed revival of Cabaret. Richardson was also known for her cooking, having been a judge on the American television show Top Chef. She has hosted several upscale dinner parties in which she was the cook. Known names to have been part of her dinner parties are Meryl Streep and Laura Linney, among others. Richardson is survived by her husband, actor Liam Neeson, and her two sons, Daniel Jack age 12 and Micheal Richard Antonio age 13."
entertainment,"Music celebrity Calvin Broadus (aka Snoop Dogg) was arrested by US Customs and Border Protection on Saturday at the US/Mexico Sierra Blanca highway border checkpoint for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Bill Brooks said agents smelled cannabis when doing a routine search of Mr. Broadus's tour bus. ""When our officers did a further inspection,"" he said, ""they discovered a small amount of cannabis and turned him over to the Hudspeth County sheriff"". A local County Judge, Becky Dean Walker, stated the typical punitive measure for an illegal drug paraphernalia citation is up to a $500 mail-in fine. Mr. Broadus's agent was not available for comment. Mr. Broadus has stated in interviews that he has a prescription for cannabis in the US state of California, for migraines and blurry vision. He has been in trouble with the law in the past, and has had a number of convictions on weapon and drug possession charges. Willie Nelson, another music celebrity, was arrested at the same checkpoint for similar charges in November of 2010. The musicians created a song and music video together about cannabis in 2008, called My Medicine."
entertainment,"Television UK media regulator Ofcom has stated that remarks made on Channel 5 programme The Wright Stuff on December 6 last year in relation to the murder of Liam Aitchison were ""clearly capable of causing offence"". However, the issue has been ""resolved"", the regulator concluded in its latest broadcast bulletin. Ofcom launched an investigation in relation to a potential breach of rule 2.3 of its Broadcasting Code, which reads: ""In applying generally accepted standards broadcasters must ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by the context"". Presenter Matthew Wright employed a false Scottish accent and remarked: ""There's been another murder,"" in reference to the UK crime drama Taggart, as the murder was being discussed as part of a newspaper review. At this point, audience laughter could be heard. Charlie Baker, who was sat on the panel, responded by saying it would be ""the longest episode of Taggart of all time"" with ""lots of down-time in between"", citing the time period of approximately forty years since the last murder investigation on the Western Isles. No apology was broadcast at any point during the programme. Ofcom subsequently received at least 2,220 complaints about the incident. The regulator stated that, with his comments, Wright ""made light of the murder"" and ""went on to laugh loudly with the audience as the conversation continued"", appearing to illustrate ""no regard to the unfortunate circumstances of this murder case concerning the killing of a 16 year old well known to many within the local community in which he lived."" Channel 5 would later acknowledge that these remarks were ""unfortunate, misjudged and entirely inappropriate"". A page on the social networking website Facebook, entitled 'Report The Wright Stuff to Ofcom', accumulated in excess of 2,500 likes. In the next edition of the show the following day, Wright apologised, saying it was ""certainly no intention on my part to belittle the seriousness or tragedy of the story, or to offend anyone who knew Liam"" but remarked that he was ""not helped though by people running campaigns - 'report Matthew Wright to Ofcom'. I mean, grow up, folks"". Ofcom said these comments would have ""potentially caused further offence to viewers"". Channel 5 went on to retract access to this edition and the edition from the day before from Demand 5, its Internet catch up service. On the December 8 programme, Wright apologised again. ""I deeply, deeply regret my thoughtless comments,"" Wright said, ""and very sincerely apologise to Liam's family and his community. I truly apologise OK, from the bottom of my heart if I have made their suffering worse. I should add that Charlie Baker also wishes to apologise unreservedly"". The Aitchison family subsequently accepted a direct apology issued to them by Wright. As a result of this incident, Channel 5 decided to re-examine the compliance and editorial rules set between Channel 5 and The Wright Stuffs production company. Channel 5 also committed the major production team members of The Wright Stuff to learning about compliance in greater detail. Ofcom was of the opinion that ""these comments were clearly capable of causing offence to viewers given the sensitivity surrounding the very recent murder of a 16 year old teenager in an isolated Scottish community."" However, ""on balance, and in light of the steps taken by Channel 5 to mitigate this offence, Ofcom considered the matter resolved."" The regulator does not intend to take any further action over this incident. A recent status update from 'Report The Wright Stuff to Ofcom' clarified its administrator's intention to remove the page on Thursday."
entertainment,"Set to hit newstands in the United States on Monday, the annual news feature by TIME magazine pictures on its glossy front page an Apple iMac-styled computer keyboard and monitor with a reflective monitor surface that reflects YOU as the most influential Person of the Year, for ""community and collaboration on a scale never seen before."" ""For seizing the reins of the global media, for founding and framing the new digital democracy, for working for nothing and beating the pros at their own game, Time's Person of the Year for 2006 is you,"" Lev Grossman, Time's technology writer, wrote. The magazine claims that those who contribute content to the web are the ones driving the information age, instead of mainstream media. ""It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes,"" said Grossman. Magazine editor Richard Stengel said, ""If you choose an individual, you have to justify how that person affected millions of people. But if you choose millions of people, you don’t have to justify it to anyone.” 26 “People Who Mattered” are listed in the magazine, ranging from North Korea's president Kim Jong Il to Pope Benedict XVI. According to Stengel, if the magazine had to choose an individual the choice was likely to have been Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Stengel however seemed uneasy about naming Ahmadinejad. “It just felt to me a little off selecting him,” said Time's editor. There has been a ""Time Person of the Year"" since 1927 and the special issue has become a catalyst for speculation every year. In the past there have been controversies with Adolf Hitler named in 1938 and Ayatollah Khomeini named in 1979. According to the magazine, the person of the year are those who affected the news and our lives both positively and negatively over the past year. It is not the first time the magazine has departed from naming an actual person as Person of the Year. In 1966 the magazine named people under 25, in 1975 it named American women, and in 1982 it named the computer."
entertainment,"New Zealand Movie studio company, New Line Cinema has announced that movie director Peter Jackson will never be allowed to work on another New Line film. This announcement will also mean that Mr Jackson will not be allowed to film the prequel titled The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings films he directed. The announcement was made mainly because New Zealander Mr Jackson and his partner, Fran Walsh, filed a law suit against New Line in 2005 as they believed New Line owed them much more money than they received for The Lord of the Rings trilogy as shown to them by a partial audit of The Fellowship of the Ring. Mr Jackson described it as ""financial anomalies,"" which New Line refused to account for. ""Fundamentally, our legal action is about holding New Line to its contractual obligations and promises."" The film trilogies have so far managed to earn US$3 billion in ticket sales since 2001. New Line has repeatedly refused permission for Mr Jackson to audit the other films in the trilogy The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, even though Mr Jackson described film auditing as a common practice. ""We don't understand why New Line Cinema has taken this position,"" Mr Jackson said. In an interview with the Sci Fi Wire, Robert Shaye, co-chairman of New Line and executive producer of The Lord of the Rings, said that New Line does not want to do any films, including The Hobbit, with Mr Jackson in the future. ""I do not want to make a movie with somebody who is suing me. It will never happen during my watch."" ""I don't care about Peter Jackson anymore. He wants to have another $100 million or $50 million, whatever he's suing us for,"" Mr Shaye said. Mr Shaye said he has been offended by the lawsuit brought to his company by Mr Jackson. ""He got a quarter of a billion dollars paid to him so far, justifiable, according to contract, completely right, but then turns around without wanting to have a discussion with us and sues us and refuses to discuss it unless we just give in to his plan."" However Mr Jackson claims that he had been trying to discuss it with New Line, saying: ""We attempted to discuss the issues raised with New Line for over a year but the studio was and continues to be completely uncooperative. ... Nobody likes taking legal action, but the studio left us with no alternative."" Mr Jackson has said that he has and will continue to have the highest respect and affection for Mr Shaye and has said that he regrets he has taken the lawsuit personally. ""Jackson's either had very poor counsel or is completely misinformed and myopic to think that I care whether I give him anything,"" Mr Shaye said. Mr Shaye has said he is disappointed that many of the stars in The Lord of the Rings trilogy had refused to celebrate New Line's 40th anniversary. Mr Jackson said that the reason for that was probably because Mr Shaye had issues with the cast years before the lawsuit arose."

entertainment,"A report published last week in the Toronto Star by Professor Michael Geist of Canada's University of Ottawa claims a copyright case under the Class Proceedings Act of 1992 may see the country's largest players in the music industry facing upwards of 6 billion in penalties. The case is being led by the family and estate of the late jazz musician Chet Baker; moving to take legal action against four major labels in the country, and their parent companies. The dispute centres around unpaid royalties and licensing fees for use of Baker's music, and hundreds of thousands of other works. The suit was initially filed in August last year, but amended and reissued on October 6, two months later. At that point both the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA) and Society for Reproduction Rights of Authors (SODRAC) were also named defendants. January this year SODRAC and CMRRA switch sides, joining Baker et al. as plaintiffs against Sony BMG Music, EMI Music Canada, Universal Music Canada and Warner Music Canada. David A. Basskin, President and CEO of CMRRA, with a professional law background, stated in a sworn affidavit that his organisation made numerous attempts over the last 20 years to reduce what is known as the ""pending list"", a list of works not correctly licensed for reproduction; a list of copyright infringements in the eyes of the Baker legal team. The theoretical principle of the list is to allow timely commercial release while rights and apportionment of monies due are resolved. Basskin complains that it is ""economically infeasible to implement the systems that would be needed to resolve the issues internally"". And, ""... for their part, the record labels have generally been unwilling to take the steps that, in the view of CMRRA, would help to resolve the problem."" The Baker action demands that the four named major labels pay for and submit to an independent audit of their books, ""including the contents of the 'Pending Lists'"". Seeking an assessment of gains made by the record companies in ""failure or refusal to compensate the class members for their musical works"", additional demands are for either damages and profits per the law applicable in a class action, or statutory damages per the Copyright Act for copyright infringement. 5=Affidavit supporting class action This forms the basis for Professor Geist's six billion dollar calculation along with Basskin's sworn testimony that the pending lists cover over 300,000 items; with each item counted as an infringement, the minimum statutory damages per case are CA$500, the maximum $20,000. Basskin's affidavit on behalf of CMRRA goes into detail on the history leading up to the current situation and class action lawsuit; a previous compulsory license scheme, with poor recordkeeping requirements, and which, had a decline in real terms to one of the lowest fees in the world, was eventually abolished and the mechanical license system introduced. The CMRRA went on to become a significant representative of music publishers and copyright holders, and the pending list an instrument to deal with situations where mechanical rights were as-yet not completely negotiated. Basskin's affidavit claiming the list grew and circumstances worsened as time progressed. The Mechanical Licensing Agreement (MLA) between the ""majors'"" industry body, an attached exhibit to the affidavit, is set to expire December 31, 2012; this is between CMRRA and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). With the original MLA expiring at end September 1990, CMRRA negotiated more detailed terms and a ""code of conduct"". Subsequent agreements were drawn up in 1998, 2004, 2006, and 2008. Basskin asserts that the named record company defendants are the ""major"" labels in Canada and states they ""are also responsible for creating, maintaining and administering the so-called ""Pending Lists"" that are the subject of the current litigation""; that, specific to publishing, divisions of the four represent the ""'major' music publishers active in Canada"". Yet the number of music publishers they represent has decreased over time due to consolidation and defection from the CRIA. Geist summarizes the record company strategy as ""exploit now, pay later if at all"". This despite the CMRRA and SODRAC being required to give lists of all collections they represented to record labels, and for record labels to supply copies of material being released to permit assessment of content that either group may represent interested parties for. Where actual Mechanical License Agreements are in place, Basskin implies their terms are particularly broad and preclude any party exercising their legal right to decline to license. Specific to the current Mechanical Licensing Agreement (MLA) between the CMRRA and the CRIA; a ""label is required to provide an updated cumulative Pending List to CMRRA with each quarterly payment of royalties under the MLA."" The CMRRA is required to review the list and collect where appropriate royalties and interest due. Basskin describes his first encounter with pending lists, having never heard of them before 1989, thus: ...In the early years of my tenure, CRMMA received Pending Lists from the record labels in the form of paper printouts of information. The information contained on these lists varied from record label to record label, ... in fact, within a few days after my arrival at CMRRA, I recall my predecessor, Paul Berry, directing my attention to a large stack of paper, about two feet high. and informing me that it was PolyGram's most recent Pending List. Prior to that introduction I had never heard of Pending Lists. Alain Lauzon, General Manager of Canada's Society for Reproduction Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (SODRAC) submitted his followup affidavit January 28, 2009 to be attached to the case and identify the society as a plaintiff. As such, he up-front states ""I have knowledge of the matters set out herein."" Lauzon, a qualified Chartered Accountant with an IT specialisation, joined SODRAC in 2002 with ""over 20 years of business experience."" He is responsible for ""negotiation and administration of industry-wide agreements for the licensing of music reproduction and distribution""; licensing of radio and online music services use is within his remit. Lauzon makes it clear that Baker's estate, other rightsholders enjoined to the case, SODRAC, and CMRRA, have reached an agreed settlement; they wish to move forward with a class proceeding against the four main members of the CRIA. He requests that the court recognise this in relation to the initially accepted case from August 2008. 5=CMRRA The preamble of the affidavit continues to express strong agreement with that of David Basskin from CMRRA. Lauzon concurs regarding growing use of ""pending lists"" and that ""... record labels have generally been unwilling to take the steps that would help to resolve the Pending List problem."" With his background as an authority, Lauzon states with confidence that SODRAC represents ""approximately 10 to 15% of all musical works that are reproduced on sound recordings sold in Canada."" For Quebec the figure is more than 50%. Lauzon agrees that the four named record company defendants are the ""major"" labels in Canada, and that smaller independent labels will usually work with them or an independent distribution company; and Basskin's statement that ""the responsibility to obtain mechanical licenses for recordings manufactured and/or released in Canada falls with the Canadian labels by law, by industry custom, and by contractual agreement."" Wikinews attempted to contact people at the four named defendant CRIA-member record labels. The recipient of an email that Wikinews sent to Warner Brothers Canada forwarded our initial correspondence to Hogarth PR; the other three majors failed to respond in a timely fashion. Don Hogarth responded to Wikinewsie Brian McNeil, and, without addressing any of the submitted questions, recommended a blog entry by Barry Sookman as, what he claimed is, a more accurate representation of the facts of the case. I am aware of another viewpoint that provides a reasonably deep explanation of the facts, at www.barrysookman.com. If you check the bio on his site, you’ll see that he is very qualified to speak on these issues. This may answer some of your questions. I hope that helps. Sookman is a lobbyist at the Canadian Parliament who works in the employ of the the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Hogarth gave no indication or disclosure of this; his direction to the blog is to a posting with numerous factual inaccuracies, misdirecting statements, or possibly even lies; if not lies, Sookman is undoubtedly not careful or ""very qualified"" in the way he speaks on the issue. Sookman's blog post opens with a blast at Professor Geist: ""his attacks use exaggeration, misleading information and half truths to achieve his obvious ends"". Sookman attempts to dismiss any newsworthiness in Geist's article; ... As if something new has happened with the case. In fact, the case was started in August 2008 (not October 2008 as asserted by Prof. Geist). It also hasn’t only been going on “for the past year”, as he claims. Chet Baker isn’t “about to add a new claim to fame”. Despite having started over a year and a half ago, the class action case hasn’t even been certified yet. So why the fervour to publicise the case now? Should the court use admitted unpaid amounts, or maximum statutory damages &amp;ndash; as the record industry normally seeks against filesharers? As the extracted see right stamp, date, and signature, shows, the court accepted amendments to the case and its submission, as Professor Geist asserts, on October 6. The previously mentioned submissions by the heads of CMRRA and SODRAC were indeed actions within the past year; that of SODRAC's Alain Louzon being January 28 this year. Sookman continues his attack on Professor Geist, omitting that the reverse appears the case; analysis of his blog's sitemap reveals he wrote a 44-page attack on Professor Geist in February 2008, accusing him of manipulating the media and using influence on Facebook to oppose copyright reform favourable to the CRIA. In the more current post he states: Prof. Geist tries to taint the recording industry as blatant copyright infringers, without ever delving into the industry wide accepted custom for clearing mechanical rights. The pending list system, which has been around for decades, represents an agreed upon industry wide consensus that songwriters, music publishers (who represent songwriters) and the recording industry use and rely on to ensure that music gets released and to the market efficiently and the proper copyright owners get compensated. This characterisation of the pending list only matches court records in that it ""has been around for decades"". CMRRA's Basskin, a lawyer and industry insider, goes into great detail on the major labels resisting twenty years of collective societies fighting, and failing, to negotiate a situation where the labels take adequate measures to mechanically license works and pay due fees, royalties, and accrued interest. What Sookman clearly overlooks is that, without factoring in any interest amounts, the dollar value of the pending list is increasing, as shown with the following two tables for mid-2008. As is clear, there is an increase of C$1,101,987.83 in a three-month period. Should this rate of increase in the value of the pending list continue and Sony's unvalued pending list be factored in, the CRIA's four major labels will have an outstanding debt of at least C$73 million by end-2012 when the association's Mechanical Licensing Agreement runs out."
entertainment,"Comments made about Olympics swimmer Rebecca Adlington on British television programme Mock the Week ""breached guidelines"", the BBC Trust has said. Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle, at the time a panelist on the satirical gameshow, made the comments about the swimmer. The episode the comments featured on was originally broadcast in August 2008 on BBC Two. The episode caused a total of 75 complaints to be made to the BBC. The producer then apologised four months later, saying, ""the ribbing may have gone a tad too far on this occasion."" Now the BBC Trust has said that the comments ""breached guidelines"". They commented that the jokes ""risked offending the audience"" and were ""humiliating"". Speaking about the comments, BBC Trustee Richard Tait made a statement saying: ""For Mock the Week, the Trust's Editorial Standards committee felt that the comments about Rebecca were humiliating, and this was exacerbated by the fact that she had not sought celebrity status or courted media attention. There was no clear editorial purpose for the joke's inclusion."" Boyle's specific comments were quoted in The Daily Telegraph and were as follows: ""The thing that nobody really said about Rebecca Adlington is that she looks pretty weird. She looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon...When she arrived back on the flight from Beijing she met her boyfriend. Did you see her boyfriend? He was really attractive. He was like a male model. So from that I have deduced that Rebecca Adlington is very dirty."" This information came through seventeen days after the BBC announced that Frankie Boyle would be leaving the panel of the show after being a regular panellist since the show started in June 2005 due to ""other television commitments"". The show had been running for seven series, and will continue to run for another two seasons, despite his absence. A spokesperson for Mock the Week had said that he had been ""a brilliant member of the team"" and that ""the door is always open for him to come back""."
entertainment,"__NOTOC__ Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, a filmmaker widely regarded as one of the great masters of modern cinema, died today at his home on Fårö, Gotland, Sweden. He was 89. The exact cause of death is not known. ""It's an unbelievable loss for Sweden, but even more so internationally,"" Astrid Söderbergh Widding, president of The Ingmar Bergman Foundation, told Associated Press. ""This is an enormous loss, not only for artistic Sweden but because he was one of the most well-known Swedes in the world,"" Jon Asp, a spokesperson for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg. ""Had it not been for his struggles in the 40s and 50s, Swedish directors such as Jan Troell and Bo Widerberg may not have been able to make films."" ""He was one of the world's biggest personalities. There were Kurosawa, Fellini and then Bergman. Now he is also gone,"" Danish director Bille August said to Associated Press. ""It is a great loss. I am in shock."" Hungarian director István Szabó told MTI: ""The Bergman films are to viewers like the novels of a great novelist, the poems of a great poet or the works of a great drama writer ... He valued contact with the audience very much and the story which can be told to them, while he did not attribute a great value to stories which can only be understood by snobs and highly qualified aesthetes."" Born Ernst Ingmar Bergman in 1918 in Uppsala, Sweden to a Lutheran minister of Danish descent, Bergman grew up surrounded by religious imagery and discussion. He had a strict upbringing and went through two five-month stretches of mandatory military service. He attended Stockholm High School and Stockholm University, without completing his degree in literature and art. He instead became interested in theatre and later in film. Despite his devout upbringing, Bergman said that he lost his faith at age eight but did not come to terms with this until later in his filmmaking career. Since the early sixties Bergman lived much of his life on the island of Fårö, where he made a number of his films. In 2004 he said he would never again leave the island. He was married five times and had nine children. Although Bergman was universally famous for his contribution to cinema, he was an active and productive stage director all his life, and was manager and director of a number of the most prestigious theatres in Sweden. As a director, Bergman favored intuition over intellect, and chose to be unaggressive in dealing with actors. Bergman saw himself as having a great responsibility toward them, viewing them as collaborators often in a psychologically vulnerable position. He stated that a director must be both honest and supportive in order to allow others their best work. His films usually deal with existential questions of mortality, loneliness, and faith; they also tend to be direct and not overtly stylized. Persona, one of Bergman's most famous films, is unusual among Bergman's work in being both existentialist and avant-garde. Bergman usually wrote his own scripts, thinking about them for months or years before starting the actual process of writing, which he viewed as somewhat tedious. His earlier films are carefully structured, and are either based on his plays or written in collaboration with other authors. Bergman stated that in his later works, when on occasion his actors would want to do things differently from his own intentions, he would let them, noting that the results were often ""disastrous"" when he did not do so. As his career progressed, Bergman increasingly let his actors improvise their dialogue. In his latest films, he wrote just the ideas informing the scene and allowed his actors to determine exact dialogue. Ingmar Bergman, who made over 50 films, rarely watched them. ""I don't watch my own films very often. I become so jittery and ready to cry ... and miserable. I think it's awful,"" Bergman said. *Crisis (1946) (Kris) *Prison (1949) (Fängelse) *Thirst/Three Strange Loves (1949) (Törst) *To Joy (1950) (Till glädje) *Dreams (1955) (Kvinnodröm) aka Journey Into Autumn *Smiles of a Summer Night (1955) (Sommarnattens leende) *Wild Strawberries (1957) (Smultronstället) *The Virgin Spring (1960) (Jungfrukällan) (won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) *Through a Glass Darkly (1961) (Såsom i en spegel) (won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) *Persona (1966) *Shame (1968) (Skammen) *Cries and Whispers (1973) (Viskningar och rop) (won Academy Award for Best Cinematography) *The Magic Flute (1975) (Trollflöjten), first shown on Swedish television, followed by a cinematic release *Fanny and Alexander (1982) (Fanny och Alexander) (won 4 Academy Awards, including one for Best Foreign Language Film)"

His wife, Huma Abedin, did not accompany him, but Weiner apologized to her in his speech, saying that he hopes ""most importantly, that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage that I've caused."" He took no questions from reporters. On June 6, Weiner had admitted to corresponding with women he met on the internet, including exchanging lewd photos. But on June 11 he declared in an emotional interview he would not resign. Under pressure from Democrats, Weiner requested a two-week leave of absence from his position in order to obtain treatment to become ""a better husband and healthier person."" However, Democratic politicians became increasingly anxious to put the growing scandal behind them, as it distracted members from more important issues such as problems with Medicare and the need for more jobs. As the scandal gained momentum, a variety of politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called on him to resign. President Barack Obama said he would resign if he were in Weiner's place in an interview with ABC News. ""Weiner exercised poor judgment in his actions and poor judgment in his reaction to the revelations,"" Pelosi said in a statement after Weiner announced his resignation. ""Today, he made the right judgment in resigning."" The scandal came to light May 27 after Weiner accidentally sent a photograph of his crotch on his public stream on the social networking website Twitter, and then tried to cover it up by blaming hackers for posting the picture, denying all responsibility. Weiner later admitted sending online messages to other women, including to a 17-year-old high school student in Delaware, though a police investigation uncovered nothing illegal. On Wednesday, a former porn actress revealed that she had engaged in an online relationship with Weiner and that Weiner had asked her to lie about the nature of their contact. More photos have continued to emerge, including one showing his nude genitals, and others showing him half naked. On Wednesday, the National Enquirer published images of Weiner cross-dressing while he was a college student at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. In one photo, he is seen wearing a bra and pantyhose, while in another he is oiled and wearing swimming trunks. source=Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Colleagues said Weiner wanted to wait for the return home of his wife, Abedin, before making a final career decision. He has been married for almost a year to Abedin, who is pregnant with the couple's first child. She is a top aide to Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, and the couple's wedding was presided over by former President Bill Clinton. She returned home to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning after having traveled with Clinton in the Middle East and Africa since June 8. Weiner's district covers parts of Brooklyn and Queens, boroughs of New York City. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 2005, and he was considered a potential candidate for future races. Known to be an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, he has irked conservatives and Democratic leaders. In 2009, he pushed for government-run health care, even though Obama had opposed the idea."
entertainment,"Many rhythm gamers are anticipating the release of ""Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"", the Namco Bandai Games Inc. (NBGI) beta version of which was recently showcased at the 2008 Taipei Game Show. In fact, several managers from amusement stores in Taiwan frequently imported large quantities of arcade games, including rhythm games. Eventually, some slot machine developers modified codes from several game consoles like the Wii, PlayStation 2 (PS2), and Sega Saturn to fulfill needs for amusement arcades, but they risked hardware failure and copyright infringement. But before those modifications happened in Taiwan, many rhythm games just used songs from other arcade machines due to copyright issues from enrolled songs. The upcoming game will benefit Mandarin-language gamers after its release, but it may hide some secrets behind the development of ""Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"". Wikinews reporter Rico Shen recently interviewed the producer of ""Taiko no Tatsujin"" Tatsuhisa Yabushita to talk about some of the background of this upcoming game and its series. Rico Shen It became a hot topic after the NBGI decided to showcase the ""Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"" at the 2008 Taipei Game Show, and it's different from past series' because the NBGI acquired several Mandarin-language songs from the Cross-Strait area (Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong) especially. When you choose them, what factors go into the decision? Tatsuhisa Yabushita: We the NBGI enrolled those various songs based on their own performances and rankings from Cross-Strait countries. But we'll still keep several songs from Namco original, Japanese-pop, and classical music in this upcoming game. RS I believe that a developer should be aware of international copyright coordination before choosing a song for a game, not only in rhythm games, but also games of other types. For instance, I know that some controversy erupted in Taiwan after some covers of Japanese songs were recorded in other languages without agreements from the original singers and composers. Before the release of this upcoming game, have you coordinated with record companies about the copyright issues? Yabushita: Everyone should respect copyrights, as you said. I guarantee that every song from the ""Taiko no Tatsujin"" series in console and arcade versions is licensed through coordination with those companies. RS Some gamers may be confused because the console version of the ""Taiko no Tatsujin"" series is only available for PS2. After the release of the ""Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"", will the NBGI release different versions in different countries similar to the way ""Taiko Drum Master"" was released with special designs for American and European gamers? Yabushita: Currently, we'll focus our developments on the arcade version and temporarily not to consider different releases for different countries. This is because we will evaluate opinions from amusement stores and gamers after its release. The ""Taiko no Tatsujin"" series became a hot topic after amusement stores imported several arcade machines in Taiwan. The release of the ""Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"" aims to please countries speaking the Mandarin language."

The coach taught the members of the group in the 1960s and was reportedly hard on the students. He later said in a 2009 interview that ""he was just following the rules"". He disputed the rumours that he was extra tough on them or that he kicked them out of school. In later years he opened up his own bar and became friends with some members of the group and even introduced them at one of their concerts in Jacksonville."

entertainment,"The BBC, who broadcast the Live 8 event throughout Saturday and Sunday, has received hundreds of complaints regarding ""swearing outbursts"". Madonna and Snoop Dogg are among those who used ""bad language"" before the 9:00PM watershed. Following last year's Super Bowl, where U.S. broadcasting networks were criticised for not forecasting Janet Jackson's bodily exposure, the BBC pledged to incorporate a time delay of several seconds in certain live broadcasts in order to provide a level of censorship to potentially violent/unsuitable scenes. The Live 8 event, however, was broadcast live. The BBC, said a spokesperson, had received ""just under"" 400 complaints regarding the use of language in its coverage. ""Millions of people enjoyed our 12 hours of live broadcasting. We are sorry if any offence was caused."", she added. The stars accused of swearing before the watershed include Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Johnny Borrell (Razorlight) and Billie-Joe Armstrong (Green Day). Previous complaints received by the BBC range from 240 complaints made as a result of the new 3D weather map, to 47,000 in the build up to the broadcast of ""Jerry Springer - The Opera""."

In this case, the revellers were made aware of the venue only hours prior to the event."
entertainment,"Last Sunday evening at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California were the 67th Annual Golden Globe Awards hosted by English comedian Ricky Gervais. The choice of Gervais as host was a move to increase viewership which declined to 15 million viewers last year from 27 million in 2004. Canadian director James Cameron—who previously won in 1997 for his film Titanic—and his high-grossing 3D epic Avatar seemed to dominate the ceremony, taking home the awards for Best Director and Best Picture respectively. This annual event—which is often considered a preview of the Academy Awards—is conducted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to recognize achievements by those within both the motion picture and television industries internationally. In the midst of the festivities, the earthquake in Haiti was still on the minds of many attendees. For instance, some wore lapel ribbons to honor the victims, while others noted how strange it was for them to be enjoying something like an award ceremony in the midst of such tragedy. On incident of this was when American actress Meryl Streep got emotional while accepting the Best Actress award for her portrayal of chef Julia Child in the film Julia &amp; Julia, ""I am really honestly conflicted about how to have my 'happy movie self' in the face of everything that I'm aware of in the real world."" She went on to mention her late mother, who Streep said would have told her to be grateful that she does in fact have the money to donate to people of Haiti. Following this, American actor George Clooney officially announced his intention to coordinate a telethon that would air on NBC, among other networks worldwide, on January 22 to raise money for those affected by the quake.

Oh, thank you all for being here today. That's the good part of getting old. I don't recommend the other. It's not possible for me to express my appreciation to the countless people who helped me on this great trip, this wonderful journey of being in the movies. But I can thank the members of the Board of Governors of the Academy and to Nicole Kidman who so graciously introduced me. I would like to remember some of the old folk, like Hans Dreier who took a chance and gave me my first job in the movies, and to ""Hitch"" who also took a chance and gave me my first big film. And I also would like to remember that Hitch introduced me to the screenwriter Bess Taffel, who became my wife and my companion throughout this wonderful journey. I also would like to thank my children and grandchildren who supported me with their love and support, thank them. To Norman Jewison who made moviemaking fun and much laughter while dealing with real subjects. And to Don Siegel, who cut to the chase and gave us truth. And with all of these, there was my beginning at the USC School of Architecture and my great colleagues in the Art Directors Guild who supported me, and, finally, to Jean Firstenberg who introduced me to the American Film Institute and the opportunity to give back to the next generation of storytellers. Since I've been around here for almost a century, I've noted a lot of conflicts, but there was one bright image in this whole life of ours, and that was the arts, and particularly the art of the moviemakers, of the moving image that we all love. So I have, I have had the good fortune to be a part of this and I thank you all for being there for me. Thank you."
entertainment,"Singing group At Last was recently a finalist in America's Got Talent, covering songs like ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Ain't No Sunshine"". Talent was a NBC television series search for America's next big talent, featuring singers, dancers, magicians, comedians and other talents of all ages. The series was hosted by Regis Philbin, and judged by former tabloid editor Piers Morgan, singer Brandy, and actor/singer David Hasselhoff. They talked to Wikinews about their group's performances and the America's Got Talent experience. Q: At Last performs ""hip-hopapella"" (hip hop a cappella). For those who didn't see you on America's Got Talent, how would you describe this sound? : A: Hip-hopapella was born out of a rehearsal when we were just messing around between songs. We were singing ""Killing Me Softly"" and harmonizing when Mike decided to throw in a beatbox, and it was like WOW... it was just magical and we knew right away we had discovered a new sound for us. Our producer came up with the name. Since then it's really evolved into fat layers of harmonies over a hip hop style bassline and beatbox. We like taking old school songs and flipping it hip-hopapella style to create something recognizable yet fresh. Q: The band has sung at concerts with many noted names, and on quite a few television series. Where in America have audiences been most enthusiastic? : A: We think we get the most enthusiastic responses in areas where there aren't a lot of Asian people. For example, in the midwest or the south. At first, they have their typical stereotypes of what we are. All they see is William Hung. But then they hear these four Asian guys sing R&amp;B, and they're shocked. After the shock wears off, they realize they just like what they hear, regardless of the faces. Q: How did At Last first form? : A: We all met at an audition, held by actress Ming-Na, and have been together for five years. Together with her, we have the goal of showing America and the world that Asian Americans love music too. Q: Of your competitors, who was your personal favorite? (Any point in the competition, not just among the finalists.) : A: We loved Bobby Badfingers. He just had an incredible energy and has flat out the best showman in the competition. Backstage, he was so personable too. Actually everyone on the show was very friendly and open... we made a lot of new friends on that show. Q: Who was your favourite judge? : A: It's hard not to answer Brandy, because she had so much love for us, especially early on. But we have to go with Piers because of his honesty. Ultimately, his comments are the ones America respects the most. Q: Overall, are you satisfied with the experience ""America's Got Talent"" provided? : A: We're very happy with our experience on the show. We got more exposure than we ever have before and we've made some great new friends and contacts. We got to show America who we are and what we can do, and even though we didn't win, we've gained so much. Q: What's next for At Last? : A: We finished an album just before we started doing AGT, so we're going to get back to promoting that and start touring. interview To find out more about At Last, visit their official site, www.atlastmusic.com/. You can ""friend"" them at MySpace: At Last, or keep current with their biweekly webcast on Youtube."

Matt Stone commented on the three-year contract to produce more episodes of the series: ""Three more years of South Park will give us the opportunity to offend that many more people ... And since Trey and I are in charge of the digital side of South Park, we can offend people on their cellphones, game consoles, and computers too. It's all very exciting for us."" 4=Matt Stone and Trey Parker Parker and Stone released a statement about the website: ""We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time, so we gave ourselves a legal alternative."" Parker and Stone don't think that the move will affect DVD sales of past seasons, because fans will still want to own episodes in a ""hard copy"" format. The website is managed by South Park Digital Studios LLC, a joint venture of Parker and Stone and Comedy Central. Anne Garefino, general manager of South Park Digital Studios stated: ""One goal in moving forward is to make every episode of South Park available worldwide ... Currently, full episodes are not available in the U.K., Australia and a few other foreign territories, but we're not far off from making that happen. We have some contractual issues to sift through but we're getting there."" On the move to make the episodes available for free, Sam Thielman of Variety wrote: ""It's a good time for Parker and Stone to distance themselves from the YouTube community given Comedy Central parent Viacom's protracted lawsuit against the Web-based video distrib, which features clips from the show."" Viacom is suing YouTube for US$1 billion in damages relating to video clips displayed on the video-sharing website. Richard Menta of MP3 Newswire wrote: ""With all their content already out there Stone, Parker and Viacom realized offering South Park episodes online directly is a low risk proposition. They might as well draw some ad revenue from it."""

entertainment,"New Zealand Apple Computers announced today that it's long awaited iTunes store is available to New Zealanders. They also launched the online Apple Store New Zealand which provides Apple products, such as iPods, Mac minis, etc. New Zealand is number 22 on the number of countries who have the iTunes store and the tenth music download store in New Zealand. The launch means that New Zealanders can now download music to transfer to their iPods, legally. However the music is only available to iPod's as converting the music to the MP3 standard for other MP3 players is illegal in New Zealand. Some music download sites in New Zealand support MP3 formats, like Digirama which sell their music tracks for $1.75. The New Zealand iTunes store provides the most digital music tracks in New Zealand at around two million and each song costs NZ$1.79 or a music video costs $3.59 of which there around thousands, an album will usually cost about $17.99 and a game will cost $7.99. The music tracks also include New Zealand artists such as Brooke Fraser, Tim Finn, Fat Freddy's Drop, etc and also includes international exclusive albums such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ben Harper, etc. Eddy Cue, vice president of Apple, said: ""We're thrilled to bring the iTunes Store and the online Apple Store to our customers in New Zealand just in time for the holidays."" There were rumours surrounding the launch of a New Zealand iTunes store this week. The podcast section on iTunes also covers a wide range of podcasts, equalling over 65,000. The New Zealand podcasts include such companies as TVNZ (Television New Zealand), Radio New Zealand and The Voice Booth. It is commonly believed that the reason the store was halted until now was because Apple has to make separate contracts with each recording company in each country. iTunes is likely to become the dominant music download store in New Zealand, following the trend of other countries. The special edition iPod nano has also been released in New Zealand. The special edition is red in colour instead of the normal white and black colours. The special iPod is available only on the online store at the same price as the normal iPod nanos but some of the profit goes to help fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. Renaissance is New Zealand's distributor of Apple goods and will still keep its contract despite Renaissance not being directly involved in both of the new online stores. Renaissance said: ""New Zealand will now come under Apple's worldwide pricing model."""
entertainment,"Star of one of the longest-running shows in television history, 79-year-old Chris Wedes is celebrating half a century since he became ""Julius Pierpont Patches"". From 1958 to 1981, CBS affiliate KIRO-TV produced The J.P. Patches Show. The show featured J.P., the Mayor of the City Dump, who lived in a shack with multiple characters visiting. Virtually the entire supporting cast, male and female, human or non-human, was played by the versatile Bob Newman. The character itself is more than 50 years old. J. P. Patches was created at NBC-affiliate WTCN by Daryl Laub. When he left for KSTP-TV, also in Minnesota, the character was taken over by Wedes. (Wedes was then an actor, DJ, and kids TV cook.) In 1958, Wedes moved to Seattle, to become the first floor director at KIRO-TV, bringing The J.P. Patches Show with him. (Laub, meanwhile, created T. N. Tatters at another station.) The show aired twice a day for 13 years, and once on Saturdays, for 8 more years just in the morning, and for the final two years only on Saturday morning. In total, an estimated 12,000 shows made the air, all of them live, with next to no budget. Wedes told the Everett Herald that: ""I'm still amazed at the longevity of the character. When I go on appearances, I get hugs, I get tears, I get laughter. The people are so in love with J.P. Patches. I can't believe it that it has hung on that long."" Businesses paid Wedes and the station to appear in character at grand openings, appeared at a Boeing Christmas party with an audience of 55,000, and appeared on Darigold milk containers, Sunbeam bread bags, and Dankens ice cream lids. Even still, the image has been licensed for bobble heads and an action figure. The book ""J.P. Patches: Northwest Icon"" was published in 2002. While the cartoons were airing, Wedes' Patches would greet guest children; the waiting list was for a while six months long. Children who stopped by include now-billionaire Bill Gates, and former Washington Governor Gary Locke. Celebrities appearing on the show included politicians, Olympic medalists, comedian Steve Allen, Burt ""Robin"" Ward of Batman, folk singer Tiny Tim, actress Debbie Reynolds, oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, and Colonel Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Some parents objected to KIRO-TV dropping the national series Captain Kangaroo, three years into its run, to put in Patches. A minor controversy erupted when a local newspaper photographed Wedes, being taken in an ambulance when involved in a car crash, not of his own fault. The official site reads that ""The picture distressed many local children and would remain an embarrassment to the local media if they actually had any shame."" There are still enough ""Patches Pals"", fans of the show, that a statue is planned for Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. To be completed this summer, the fundraiser is just $55,000 away from the $165,000 needed for the sculpture of Patches with Gertrude, the character's girlfriend. They've so far donated $110,000 of $165,000 to cast a bronze statue of J.P. Patches and his sidekick Gertrude to be placed in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. More money is still needed for the statue, being made by a Sultan sculptor and completed this summer. Any money raised that isn't needed for the statue, coordinated by the local chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, goes to the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle; the statue itself will have a slot to collect money for the hospital. Billboards around the region track the fundraising progress. Wedes was diagnosed in October with a controllable but incurable blood cancer, ""acute myeloma"". He had to avoid public appearance until recently, due to the told of dialysis. He made seven county fair appearances in 2007, and 30 other gigs. Newman often joins him to perform, despite have multiple sclerosis for the past 20 years. The two will appear in ""An Evening With JP Patches &amp; Gertrude: The Men Behind The Makeup"", April 5 at The 7th Street Theatre in Hoquiam."
entertainment,"Once you get a chance to talk to West Palm Beach, Florida native Whitney Cunningham, who placed seventh on the eighth cycle of the popular reality TV series America's Next Top Model, you begin to understand what host Tyra Banks meant when she described her as the ""full package."" First of all, she is confident and headstrong, which is a must on these kinds of shows, almost as much as it is to take a beautiful modelesque picture. Second, she turns that confidence into drive. She has been receiving steady work as a model since leaving the show, and still believes that her goal of being the first woman to wear a size ten dress on the cover of Vogue is in reach. Third, and probably most important to television viewers, she obliterates the age-old model stereotype that to be pretty and photograph well, one must also be vapid and without a thought. A graduate of Dartmouth College, Cunningham also dreams of becoming a writer, and is working toward dual goals: a model who can express herself like no other model before her. Cunningham recently sat down with Wikinews reporter Mike Halterman in an impassioned interview, taking hours to field questions from the reporter as well as from fans of America's Next Top Model. Always in high spirits, Cunningham shows that she is a distinct personality who has carved her own niche in the Top Model history books. At the same time, she exhibits a joie de vivre that is oddly reminiscent of earlier Top Model fan favorite Toccara Jones, who showed America just how to be ""big, black, beautiful and loving it."" However, Cunningham is quick to remind everyone that she isn't big at all; she is simply a regular woman. This is the first in a series of interviews with America's Next Top Model contestants. Interviews will be published sporadically. :Whitney was going to be interviewed with fellow Top Model contestant Keenyah Hill, but the interviews were ultimately done separately. Whitney and Keenyah, both based in New York City, chitchat before the interview about the restaurant where Keenyah works. Keenyah wonders if Whitney has ever eaten there, and to Keenyah's surprise, Whitney has. They make plans to keep in touch after the interview. Whitney's interview followed later. Mike Halterman: So, who were the people you looked up to and inspired you to pursue modeling? :Whitney Cunningham: You know modeling was something that I was always interested in, but I would have to say that modeling was not an interest of mine that took a priority over my other interests. I've always been a basketball player and someone who was serious about academic achievement so I looked up to people who were eminent in those areas&amp;mdash;i.e., Cheryl Miller and Maya Angelou. I would have to say that Tyra Banks was probably someone I always revered because she has always been such a trailblazer and that is a huge quality and characteristic I strive for in myself. MH: Did you follow America's Next Top Model before appearing on the show, and if so, who did you like? :WC: Who didn't follow Top Model! I was a Top Model fiend in the first couple of cycles it was on the air. I loved Yaya because she was the educated chocolate ""sista"" who was much like myself. MH: If you could quickly summarize your experience on the show, how would you describe it? :WC: It was an absolutely memorable experience that I wouldn't change for anything in the world. Not too many people can they say that they've been a participant on a television series that has literally changed the face of popular culture in America and in countries worldwide. MH: What do your friends and family think of your stint on reality TV? :WC: I think everyone was really excited for me. I think their general sentiments are that it's cool to see someone that you know inside and out be put on display for the whole world to see. I know there were times where I would make certain faces or have certain reactions and they would always say, ""I know exactly what you were thinking."" MH: What were some of your specific pros and cons as a result of entering this contest? :WC: On the pro side, I would have to say that the exposure is incredible. I couldn't imagine how I would have been propelled into the industry so quickly if I hadn't been on the show. On the con side, I'm not exactly sure what the show's impression is on the fashion industry. I try to always remain positive, though. I, personally, have definitely used the show to my advantage as best I know how. MH: Do you ever fear what negative effect the show will have on girls? :WC: I said before that ANTM has changed the face of popular culture in America and beyond and I'll say it again. We're living in a ""Top Model Era."" Every girl, woman, boy and man wants to be a model now. But everyone cannot be a model. Modeling is not just an ""easy"" way to bring in the big bucks. It takes hard work, dedication, some hustle, and it's not meant for everyone. I kind of feel like ANTM is selling a false dream for a lot of folks out there. MH: Do you think that in some way the show can lead to girls developing an obsession with how they look, their weight, etc? :WC: I have to say no on this one. I applaud the show for their consistent efforts to try to show their viewers that beauty comes in all shapes, forms, sizes, colors, and creeds. I think that it has actually had a profoundly positive effect on the folks who watch. I can't tell you how many people stop me on the street or e-mail me just to thank me for being a role model and showing the world that very thing. MH: Did Tyra encourage a certain standard among the girls (weight or otherwise) that was unhealthy? :WC: Not at all. I think that viewers think that we have a whole lot more interaction with Tyra than we actually do. We only really saw her during panel and during our ""interventions."" laughs MH: Do you think Tyra still believes her show is about finding ""the next top model"" even though none of the show's winners have had that success? :WC: laughs That is a phenomenal question. I don't think that the show gives its winners enough time to reign. The show puts out two cycles a year. While one cycle is airing, they are taping another and apparently the show is scheduled to continue until 2010! I think it was about finding a ""Top Model"" during the show's beginnings, but I think that über-success of the show has turned it into a profit-driven production. I just wish that the show would put more time and cultivation into their winners even after their cycle's conclusions. And I truly think that the show would see a return on cultivating their winners, because the show's credibility would increase. MH: A fan wrote in to ask, ""What struggles did you face on the show as a plus sized model?"" :WC: I think that my biggest struggle was realizing that plus sized models and straight sized models are apples and oranges...I couldn't study magazines and try to develop my poses, because a woman who weighs 110 pounds and is 5'10"" looks completely different when she shapes and curves her body than a woman who is 5'10"" and weighs 175 pounds. I, therefore, had to figure things out as I went along. The other girls had a reference/vantage point to learn from. I'm still figuring things out. MH: Do you think it was unfair for Tyra to ask that studying magazines and developing your poses of you and Diana, considering that even though she's fuller-figured now, she has a lot more experience under her belt than you two did? :WC: Well, you know, I would say that it would have been fair if there were magazines for us to study! But there were none. That's why I think that it's so important that publications like Plus Model Magazine continue to blossom and flourish. I've learned more reading that magazine and getting to know the folks who write for that magazine than I ever learned about being a plus-sized model on ANTM. P.S. I'll be gracing the cover of that magazine in January of '08. Look out for me. MH: It sounds like you're doing just fine for yourself. Which one fan also asked, ""Have you faced adversity about your weight since being on the show?"" :WC: Adversity?! Absolutely not. I don't think people understand that I am a regular woman. I wear a size ten for God's sake. It's so funny because people come up to me and they say, ""Wow, you're not fat at all? You must have lost a lot of weight."" I think I just came off looking heavier on TV...that, or people just had a distorted perception of what I should look like in person. As a matter of fact I'm about 10 pounds heavier than I was on the show now and people can't believe how ""normal"" I look. But that was my aim in going on the show, that a normal woman can actually have a place in the industry. She doesn't have to be a size 2 nor does she have to be a size 18. MH: Another fan writes: Do you feel like ""plus size"" models are treated fairly? (I put ""plus size"" in quotes because I don't believe you are ""plus size""!) :WC: No, I don't. I don't think that plus-sized models are given enough respect and I don't think that folks value the plus-sized industry the way it should be valued. But I think it's because people don't know how much the plus-sized industry varies. Hell, Kim Kardashian could be considered a plus-sized model! But people automatically assume that plus-sized means obese and that no one who is obese could possibly be attractive, or sexy, or a model. But that's not the case. MH: Do you believe the producers for shows such as Top Model intentionally pick people who are perhaps unstable, for better television? :WC: Absolutely. I understand it, though. When I have my own production/entertainment company and I'm brainstorming ideas for a show, or a book, or a commercial, etc., I'll think of what sort of concepts will accrue me the largest profit. The producers of Top Model think along the same lines. Mass consumers want to see stuff that's juicy! They don't want to watch boring characters every Wednesday night. They want someone who's fun and out of the ordinary. MH: Can you explain what types of things the producers allow you to say or not say following your departure from the show? :WC: Well, the show is not taped live, so of course you're sworn to secrecy about what's happened during taping until the show actually airs. MH: Who selects your best photo for each panel and do you think there are ulterior motives involved? :WC: Tyra says she selects the photos, but who knows. I don't know about ulterior motives, but there were numerous times where I knew that I had taken a better photo than the one that appeared on the screen during panel. Every season girls say the same thing as well. It's interesting because in the last photo shoot I had before I was eliminated, Mr. Jay told me that I had finally figured out the art of modeling and I have successfully pulled off my shoot. Needless to say, I was eliminated and never saw it coming. I figured it was smooth sailing since the director of the photo shoot told me I looked like I knew what I was doing. It is what it is though. What can I say? MH: How did they decide who was going to read the Tyra Mail for the episode? Was it random, planned, or was it really who 'discovered' the note each morning? :WC: It's definitely whoever discovered the note. Contrary to popular belief, the show isn't really scripted, planned, etc. MH: Were you forced to fake your excitement over Tyra Mail? :WC: We weren't forced to do anything, but I think that we all knew what our ""expected"" reactions were to the Tyra Mail readings. We had all seen the show, we all knew what the girls acted like when Tyra Mail was read, so we basically just kind of did the same thing. It's supposed to be an exciting moment, you know? MH: Do you still keep in touch with girls from your cycle? If so, who? :WC: Most definitely. I probably have hung out with Jaslene the most since we both live in New York together and that was my girl from the beginning. Diana and I still keep in touch. I still speak to Felicia every now and then, and Kathleen and I have been out on the town (she doesn't know it yet, but she's my new hairdresser too. That girl has got a fierce weave game.) MH: What were the pressures like in the house? :WC: I actually felt like the house was my refuge. It was home! It was where I could go and let my hair down, go to sleep, read a book, call my friends and family, etc. Some of the girls might say they hated it in the house, but I was really cool with mostly all of the girls so the house was somewhere I knew I could be and just be Whitney. MH: Is it common for agencies or clients to contact you after seeing the show? :WC: No way. Models come a dime a dozen. Established modeling agencies have no reason to go out and chase girls. I'd say it's more common for companies to contact girls about making special appearances, but not modeling agencies. It's up to you to go out and find a modeling agency. MH: And do you get contacted from the guest designers that appeared on your cycle? :WC: I, personally, never have. MH: A fan really wanted to know, ""Was Dionne as funny as she was on the show?"" :WC: Dionne was really quiet and reserved. I was actually surprised to see how comedic she came off during her interviews. MH: How did you feel when Dionne and Renee only got T-shirts as a prize for winning the acting challenge? :WC: Like I was the luckiest person in the world for winning the laser beam challenge. laughs MH: There were a lot of negative reactions from fans when Jaslene won. Do you think she was the best choice? If so, why? If not, who would have been the better choice and why? :WC: Oh, my God, negative reactions? Are you kidding? Jaslene was, without a doubt, the best model at the time on the show. The only possible negative reaction I could think of is that she's so thin. And what people don't know is that Jaslene could give me a run for my money in eating. laughs She's just naturally built the way she is. MH: Some negative fan reactions were ""How could Jaslene sell a product when she can't speak English well?"" and ""Model? She's not even pretty! She looks like a man!"" Which, I wish I was making it up, but it's a rather loud fan voice on those points. What do you say to them about that? And following on that, do you think fans can be excessively cruel toward the contestants? :WC: Those ""fans"" can kiss my ___. She is from Puerto Rico and represents all that America is&amp;mdash;a large nation made up of a multitude of people from different backgrounds and places. And Jaslene is beautiful as are we all. And yes, I do believe that the fans can be excessively cruel. I don't even consider those folks fans though. They're people who have nothing else better to do with themselves than sit around and bash reality TV contestants on anonymous blog sites. MH: You and Diana were some of the only models in this cycle who were working toward a college degree. Did you feel that you were smarter than the other girls? Did people at your college watch Top Model to see you and root for you? :WC: Smarter? laughs I don't like that term because I'm an honest believer in the fact that people are all relatively smart, just in different things. I would say that I was well versed in certain areas that others were not, but that doesn't mean I'm smarter per se. And yes, folks at my school definitely watched the show. I got really positive feedback! They said I represented well. MH: And on that note, a fan wanted to know if you finished your degree at Dartmouth. :WC: Yes. MH: This past May, right? :WC: I walked in June. MH: Do you plan on moving back to Florida, or are you going to continue living in New York City? :WC: I'm definitely going to continue to live in New York for a while. I need to be where the industry is. MH: Apart from your spread in Plus Model Magazine, what else are you doing now? :WC: I'm modeling, working on my motivational speaking tour entitled ""Embrace Yourself"" (look out for me coming to a college near you in the Spring of '08), acting, and writing for a couple of magazines. MH: What is your message to the girls of America who have big dreams of their own? What would you tell them? :WC: My life's motto...If someone tells you that you can't, prove them wrong and show the world that you can."

entertainment,"A memorial service has taken place for Australian actor Heath Ledger, who died January 22 in New York. Hollywood celebrities and many other loyal fans bid farewell to the well known actor. His death has been deemed accidental by the New York City Medical Examiner and was attributed to a toxic mixture of prescription drugs and pain killers. The star died in his Manhattan apartment last month. The service was held at Penrhos College in Perth, Australia and was attended by over 100 people, although the actual funeral was only attended by Ledger's close family. Before the funeral, Heath's father, Kim Ledger, said that ""the funeral will be very, very private and there will only be 10 people there, immediate family and nobody else."" In addition to family, the memorial service was attended by actors and actresses who have worked with Ledger, including Cate Blanchett who starred with Ledger in the Bob Dylan bio-flick, I'm Not There. Blanchett spoke of the times she shared with Ledger in New York and Los Angeles. The Other speakers included his parents, sister and Neil Armfield, a director of Ledger's last Australian film, Candy. An emotional Williams, was wearing dark glasses and a white dress with black trim, she was not accompanied by her daughter Matilda. Williams walked in clutching the arm of Ledger's older sister, Kate. Williams issued a statement following Ledger's death saying, ""My heart is broken. I am the mother of the most tender-hearted, high-spirited, beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father. All that I can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day."" The Ledger family asked the media not to visit the funeral because they claim they will find it easier to cope without the media present. Ledger's father said, ""It's a pretty sad time. We're finding it difficult to cope by ourselves, let alone cope with everybody around the world."" He continued, however, by saying that the family does, ""really appreciate the outpouring and the emotional support from all over the globe."" Ledger starred in the 2005 movie Brokeback Mountain which earned him Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor. It was on the set of Brokeback Mountain where he met Michelle Williams and their relationship began. He additionally starred in the 2000 movie The Patriot with Mel Gibson."
entertainment,"This week the United Kingdom's Ofcom ruled that ITV2 ""breached standards"" with a repeat of The Montel Williams Show in which Pam and Craig Akers asked ""psychic"" Sylvia Browne where their son, Shawn Hornbeck, was. Browne told the Akers their son was dead and his body ""was in a wooded area near two boulders,"" but he was later found alive in January 2007. As a result, Browne and Montel Williams not only received heavy criticism for the failed prediction, but the airing of the show in the U.K. concerned ""breaching rule 2.1 of the Broadcasting Code, which relates to protecting viewers against offensive material."" The program distributors removed the episode from their stock and apologized for any offense to the public. Ofcom also concluded ""that a demonstration of the paranormal in this case could result in participants acting on information that could be harmful to them and the Hornbecks could have stopped searching for their child, for example."""
entertainment,"Singer and song writer Lady Gaga has warned her fans attending concerts about ""hateful"" protests that are set to take place during a concert she will be having tonight in St. Louis, Missouri. The Westboro Baptist Church will be protesting outside the venue during her concert. Gaga warned of these protests on her Twitter page. ""At the risk of drawing attention to a hateful organization, I would like to make my little monster fan sic aware of a protest being held outside the Monsterball in St.Louis tonight. Although we have had protesters before, as well as fundamentalists at the show this group of protesters are hate criminals and preach using lude sic and violent language and imagery that I wish I could protect you all from."" The Church, based in Topeka, Kansas and not affiliated with any Baptist organization, had planned to protest at Gaga's prior concerts held in St. Louis. The most recent protest was scheduled in January and was later canceled prior to the concert. According to Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokesperson for the church, ""God hates homosexuals and God hates fags and God hates whore Gaga,"" which is why the group plans a protest at tonight's concert. ""So when she gets up there and tries to hook God with that thing He calls an abomination; if you love what God hates, then God hates you,"" said Phelps-Roper in January. According to the church's website, the protest begins at 7:10 p.m. and lasts until 8:00 p.m..

Lead singer Bono gave a speech during the trip. ""Last September I was asking, what would be the most inspiring thing about Istanbul? And I said you know, Bağış, it is the bridge between the East and the West, Europe and Asia, the secular and the religious. It is very important. And then you suggested 'maybe would you like to walk on the bridge? Would you like to play a concert?' And I said a walk will be much easier than a concert. Now I am not so sure.""

entertainment,"The future of the artsy Trio channel became increasingly grim Saturday as satellite TV giant DirecTV dropped the fledgling network from its national channel lineup. When DirectTV programmers threw the off switch at 6 a.m. eastern standard time Jan. 1, Trio, an NBC Universal-owned cable television channel, lost two-thirds of its 20 million household subscribers. The channel's remaining 8 million subscribers may not give it enough audience to ensure its survival, according to some experts. The network received critical acclaim for a quirky lineup that includes the series, Brilliant But Cancelled, which took American broadcast networks, including parent NBC, to task for cancelling quality programs. Trio originally got its start in the 1980s as a Canadian cable channel owned by the CBC. Its original slate was described as ""a general entertainment channel that features the most successful contemporary dramas, documentaries and films from Canada, the UK and Australia. For the last six years, TRIO has been the largest exporter of Canadian TV programs to the US with over 3,000 hours of content,"" according to CBC press releases. The channel's Canadian roots were cut in 2000 when media mogul Barry Diller snapped up Trio and sister channel News World International from the CBC and partner Power Corp. for $155 million in cash. Diller saw the channel as a cheap consolation prize after he was outbid by NBC for the Bravo cable network earlier that year. Within months, Diller rebranded Trio, dumped the Canadian dramas and geared it more toward edgier pop culture programming. Over the next couple of years, Trio changed hands twice. First to Vivendi Universal, then to NBC in a package deal that landed the American TV network a movie studio and the USA and SCI FI cable networks. Trio was seen as more of an afterthought at the time. In a hint of what may be the fate of the channel, NBC Universal moved most of Trio's executive and programming staff over to Bravo, a now-sibling network, which is seen in 80 million U.S. homes. Some experts predict that Trio will eventually be folded with its more successful programming ported over to Bravo. ""Trio was a refreshing oasis on the dial, with a quirky pop-culture attitude that showed in its programming. Trio leaving is kind of like having a witty friend move out of town,"" Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, MSNBC television critic said in her weekly column. ""It'll be missed."" NBC Universal has not commented publicly on the long-term future or specific plans for Trio channel besides to say it was committed to programming the network for current subscribers as the conglomerate re-evaluates its digital cable strategy."

Crossing between the genres of science fiction, horror, anime, fantasy and comics, the event sprawled throughout all corners of the facility. Hundreds of vendors offered products new and old, joined by celebrity guests like Stan Lee, Mark Hamill, and Margaret Atwood. Various local fan organizations were there in a charitable capacity, and thousands of fans donned costumes, many of which they themselves created. Atwood, a Booker Prize-winner, was there to launch her graphic novel Angel Catbird, with illustrator Johnnie Christmas. Lee was making his final Canadian convention appearance, part of a larger farewell tour. Hamill's schedule included a panel with Kevin Conroy, the voice of Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, in which the Star Wars lead played the Joker. Ubisoft, Microsoft, and PlayStation VR all had large areas set up for attendees to try their latest games. In the 20-minute PlayStation VR demonstration of Batman: Arkham VR, players are dropped down a secret elevator in Bruce Wayne's manor, to the Bat Cave, to suit up. From there, the demonstration took players to investigate the murder of Nightwing. The Northern Arena Esports Championship ran throughout the weekend, facing off teams of video gamers in a packed hall. Even in early rounds, the event was well attended, with the stands full of gamers, watching the matches with live colour commentary. The finals saw US team Cloud9 and Immortals, from Brazil, face off in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Both unbeaten teams going in, the Brazillian team won the championship and $50,000. Gameplay was delayed during the ""third map"" (third round) of the finals, when one Immortals player was caught with their headset off. After nearly half an hour, the team was deducted a point, leading to a sudden but temporary rush of success by the US team.

entertainment,"Local authorities in Chicago, Illinois, United States have asked that the FBI help in the murder and kidnap investigation of the relatives of singer and Academy Award winning actress Jennifer Hudson. On Friday, Hudson's Mother Darnell Donerson, 57 and brother, Jason, 29, were shot and killed in the Southern Chicago home in what authorities are calling a domestic dispute. A cousin had found the bodies at around 2:44 p.m. (CDT) and called 9-1-1. Hudson's nephew, 7-year-old Julian King, was kidnapped from the scene and has not been seen since. An AMBER Alert was issued and police are looking for a 1994 white Chevrolet Suburban or a teal-green Chrysler Concorde. King's mother, Julia Hudson, who was previously reported missing, is pleading for whoever has her son, to release him. ""I don't care who you are, just let the baby go. I just want my son. He don't deserve this. We're in a state of shock. I don't know what else to do but pray,"" said Hudson during a press conference on Saturday. The FBI was called in because authorities suspected King might have been taken over state lines. Police have detained and questioned several people, and some reports say that includes William Balfour, who police previous thought to have kidnapped King. Reports say he is Julia's ex-boyfriend, having since been separated. Police deny that he is a suspect in either the murders or kidnapping and will not confirm or deny if he is or was in custody. So far no charges have been filed against anyone for the crimes."
entertainment,"film Music documentary The Wrecking Crew received its commercial première Friday, screening in cinemas in Los Angeles and New York via Magnolia Pictures. Two decades in the making, Denny Tedesco's documentary observes and honours a group of session musicians collectively known as ""The Wrecking Crew"". Tedesco explained he was moved to begin the documentary when he learned his father, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, had cancer in 1996. ""When they said he had a year to live &amp;mdash; and I always wanted to do this story about The Wrecking Crew &amp;mdash; my concern was, if I don't do it, it's going to be the biggest regret of my life"". Tedesco commented on his anticipation of audiences' reaction at Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles, ""People say, 'aren't you tired of watching it?' I say, 'I don't watch it, I watch the crowd'."" The documentary showcases interviews with the late Tommy Tedesco, guitarist Glen Campbell, drummers Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer, bassist Carol Kaye, and others, amongst the roughly 30 musicians that formed The Wrecking Crew's loose roster. Cher, Nancy Sinatra, and Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys are also seen talking about the session artists. The movie includes home footage of Tommy Tedesco, and photographs of The Wrecking Crew working in studios with artists Frank and Nancy Sinatra. Originally completed in 2008, and screened at several festivals, the commercial release was delayed until recently as Tedesco needed to raise money to cover licensing costs of the one hundred and ten songs included in the film. Tedesco explained: ""We had a $750,000 bill before we could even release this film theatrically, so no-one was touching us. We still had this thing around our neck. Documentaries don't sell, and music docs are the worst."" Tedesco described reaching out to sponsors to pay off publishers and labels to get the film into cinemas. ""Every time I got money from a donation, I'd pay off a label or publisher."" A Kickstarter campaign raised $300,000, which paid for licensing and session artists. Billboard reports the money was able to go towards the creation of outtakes for a future DVD. Tedesco said he wanted to keep outtakes of the interviews he conducted that didn't make it into the movie. ""I want to do outtakes of every musician, a lot of whom aren't in the movie... Who are they? What did they do? I want to give everyone their say."" The Wrecking Crew worked behind the scenes throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s with well-know bands and artists on memorable tracks such as Sonny and Cher, ""I got you Babe""; Beach Boys, ""California Girls""; Elvis Presley's, ""A Little Less Conversation""; and The Ronettes, ""Be my Baby"". Aside from the interviews, the documentary also includes footage of The Wrecking Crew, filmed by Hal Blaine. He dubbed himself a director as he joked around with the other musicians. ""I had a camera, and I took it to work and I became a director of sorts. And I'd tell people like Tommy, 'Hey, Tommy, do me a favour. I'm going to take a film of you. Just come walking into the studio, and all of a sudden pretend you've walked into a great big orgy going on here. There's all these naked women and guys.' And we're laughing about it. I did that with Glenn Campbell, all the guys"", Blaine said."

Though the tribunal has no authority to detain the convicted or enforce its verdict, it recommended payment of reparations to detainees from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib who testified before the court, and recommended they take the matter to a suitable court for enforcement. While largely symbolic, the tribunal plans to submit its findings to the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Security Council. In addition to Bush, the court also found complicit his Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo. Legal advisors for Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld were also convicted. The court heard Iraqi engineer Abbas Abid testify about removal of his fingernails by pliers. Ali Shalal recalled being made to stand on a box whilst hooded, with wires attached to him, and whilst hanging from a wall. Mozzam Begg explained how he was beaten, and Jameelah Hameedi described being stripped, and being used as a human shield. Witnesses described lasting effects."
politics,"Politics and conflicts South Korea held joint military exercises with the United States on Monday on Yeonpyeong Island, which was shelled by North Korea last month. North Korea had warned of an ""unpredictable self-defensive blow"" if the exercises went ahead, but the country did not retaliate, saying it was ""not worth"" attacking, despite ""reckless provocations"" from the South. The United Nations Security Council held an eight hour emergency meeting as tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula before the exercises began. The controversial issue divided opinion within the council; China and Russia both asked South Korea to call off the exercise over fears it could start a war on the peninsula, but the US supported its ally, saying the drills were ""fully consistent with South Korea's legal right to self defence"". Officials in Pyongyang had threatened a ""catastrophe"" if the exercises, taking place on an island close to the border with the North, went ahead. They did not attack the South, however; state media quoted a North Korean military official as saying: ""The world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war."" South Korea had said they would retaliate ""immediately and sternly"" to any attack from the North. South Korean officials reported the drills, involving K9 Thunder guns and F-15K fighter aircraft, lasted less than two hours. During the drill, civilians on Yeonpyeong Island moved into air-raid shelters, which, the BBC reported, was part of the planned procedure for the exercise. Yeonpyeong Island, which, although controlled by the South, is visible from the North, and came under attack from the North last month. Nearly 200 rounds of artillery were fired at the island in the attack; four people were killed and another 14 were injured in the attack. At the time of the attack, the South had been holding annual military exercises with the US. Troops on the island returned fire, firing nearly 80 rounds of artillery, but no damage was reported on the North Korean side."
politics,"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week. Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace. Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts. The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency? : I am running in this election because I believe strongly in the need for Christian ethics to inform the political decisions of our society. By running in this campaign, I seek to bring about a better future for Ontarians. A strong family, built on a strong marriage between a man and a woman, is the most important unit in our society and we must strive to protect this foundational institution. : I chose this riding because there was already a candidate in my home riding and I am seeking to give Ontario voters a choice to have a principled voice in legislature. What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly? : I would make every effort to raise the issue of the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, and strengthening the family in our society. How can the province lead the way in stimulating job creation? : As a province, we should be reducing the level of tax burden on our businesses and encourage the free market system. Also we should reduce the red tape necessary to recognize the credentials of immigrants which would provide a boost to our technology sector. What are your views on the mixed member proportional representation (MMP) referendum? : I strongly support MMP. It provides a electoral system where the power is not concentrated with a party that did not receive a corresponding level of voter support. With MMP the legislature will truly represent the views of Ontarians as a whole and not just the those who voted for the political party in power. What role, if any, does ""new media"" play in your campaign, and the campaign of your party? (websites, blogs, Facebook, YouTube videos, etc) Do you view it as beneficial, or a challenge? : We do our best to use e-mail and web-based means of communication... as well as You-Tube, Party Website."
politics,"The magazine Free Inquiry, issued in Buffalo, New York and published by the Center for Inquiry, is to publish some of the Islam's Prophet Muhammad cartoons. These cartoons were originally published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, causing waves of violence and protests among Muslims worldwide. Tom Flynn, editor of the secular magazine, said that he was only acting alongside several European papers that reprinted the cartoons ""demonstrating a commitment to free expression and a free press."" He commented further that ""no religious teaching, community, or institution should be held immune from criticism simply because of its religious nature."" Three articles will be published alongside the cartoons. In the first, Flynn will trace the controversy and explain the magazine's decision to publish them. A second, by R. Joseph Hoffmann, director of the Council for Secular Humanism's Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, will present further commentary; the last will be on the history of the Prophet Muhammad. Four of the original twelve cartoons are to be published: the image of Muhammad wearing a bomb with its fuse lit as a turban, another claimed to show horns coming out of the Prophet's turban, Muhammad or an Imam greeting suicide bombers in heaven, and one showing a male face on a Muslim with Islam's star and crescent. Flynn said this last cartoon ""is included as an example of how the collection's less sharply focused entries fell flat."" Arif Desai, Imam of the Islamic Society of Niagara Frontier in Amherst, New York, said that the Muslim community felt sorrow over the magazine's decision to publish the cartoons. ""We feel sorrow, we feel hurt and insulted as these are very disturbing, insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Obviously, we know and believe in freedom of speech, but along with freedom of speech comes responsibility,"" said Desai. The cartoons will be published next week on March 15, 2006."

Dodd has made a large ad buy in Iowa and New Hampshire for a spot talking about his commitment to the issues. It is the first television ad by a candidate during the campaign to discuss global warming. LCV President Gene Karpinski stated: The League of Conservation Voters applauds Senator Chris Dodd for making global warming a focal point of his campaign. Not only has Senator Dodd outlined an ambitious plan to curb global warming - he is also the first presidential candidate ever to release an ad focusing solely on this key issue. More and more Americans want our next President to address global warming and propose bold solutions to this challenge. Senator Dodd is helping to remind America that our president has the power to stop global warming — it's in their hands. We look forward to seeing the debate on this issue continue to advance in the coming months. On January 11, 2007, Dodd announced his Presidential candidacy on the now canceled Imus in the Morning radio show.

politics,"North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su-hon has asked the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) to stop providing food aid in the country. Claiming a good harvest provided the country with sufficient food, and that the US was politicizing the aid issue, the formal request to end all humanitarian aid was made to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan at a meeting on September 21. The WFP has been feeding approximately six million of the poorest and most needy in the reclusive communist state. There is much concern its withdrawal will leave many without adequate aid. 2005-09-23 Neighbouring countries, including China and South Korea, will continue to supply food aid to the North Koreans; however, the donors do not manage this aid and international organisations are unable to determine that it is reaching those who need it.

politics,"War in Georgia (2008) As the parliament of Georgia voted to approve closing the nation's embassy in Moscow and severing diplomatic ties with Russia, officials in the breakaway territory of South Ossetia are stating that their ultimate goal is not independence, but to be absorbed into Russia. Znaur Gassiyev, the speaker in the parliament of South Ossetia, said today in Tskhinvali, the capital, that the region will be annexed by Russia ""in several years"" or earlier. He further went on that this was the position of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity, who met earlier this week to discuss the future of South Ossetia. Ultimately, South Ossetia would be joined with the Russian federal subject of North Ossetia-Alania. ""We will live in one united Russian state,"" Tarzan Kokoiti, one of Gassiyev's deputies, said. However, a Russian government spokesperson said there was ""no official information"" on the talks. The Vice Speaker of the Georgian Parliament, Gigi Tsereteli, warned the areas, which are ""autonomous republics"" within Georgia, that absorption into Russia would ultimately destroy them as territorial entities. ""The regimes of Abkhazia and South Ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of Russia, they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear,"" Tsereteli said. On August 26, Russia voted to diplomatically recognize South Ossetia, as well as other another semi-autonomous region of Georgia, Abkhazia. So far, no other member of the United Nations has recognized these republics. ""We found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country, then recognizing part of its territories, is trying to create a sense of normalcy,"" Georgian Foreign Minister Ekaterine Tkeshelashvili said while in Sweden. ""Breaking off diplomatic relations with Tbilisi is not Moscow's choice, and the responsibility lies with Tbilisi,"" Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said. Russia's efforts to get other nations to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states hit a snag when the People's Republic of China and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation balked at recognition. Hugo Chávez, the president of Venezuela, said that he supports the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but did not say if Venezuela formally recognises the republics. ""Russia has recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We support Russia. Russia is right and is defending its interests,"" Chavez said. Russia and South Ossetia continue to work on an agreement to install permanent Russian military bases in the breakaway territory. The agreement is scheduled to be signed on September 2. Russian military forces continue to occupy nominal Georgian territory in defiance of the European Union-brokered ceasefire agreement."

politics,"IsraelA 2-minute siren wail which began in Israel at 10 a.m. Thursday marked the beginning of Yom HaShoah, the country's Holocaust Remembrance Day. Israelis across the nation paused their daily activities for a moment of silence in memory of the six million Jews murdered by Nazis in the Holocaust during World War II. Drivers turned off their vehicles and stood at attention in the middle of the road, and pedestrians stopped and bowed their heads. Names of victims were read aloud in the Knesset, the legislature of Israel. Individuals laid wreaths at a memorial for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising at Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to Jewish victims of the Holocaust. National ceremonies began at Yad Vashem on Wednesday evening, with the lighting of a flame by a Holocaust survivor. In all six torches were lit, in memory of the six million Jews who died during the Holocaust. Approximately 270,000 survivors of the Holocaust live in Israel today, 80,000 of whom survived Nazi death camps. Entertainment venues, theaters, and movie cinemas closed shop at sundown Wednesday. Television stations and radio programming focused on memorial of the Holocaust. Memorial events end at sunset on Thursday, and will be followed one week later by the 60th anniversary of the declaration of independence of Israel in 1948, known as Yom Ha'atzmaut. 4=Shimon Peres Shimon Peres, Israel's President, spoke at Yad Vashem, and compared the potential danger which Israel says is posed by Iran's nuclear program, to that faced by Jews during the Holocaust. ""In history, it is forbidden to be late,"" said Peres, saying that the world reacted too late to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. ""My heart shudders when I recall that there was a possibility that Hitler could acquire nuclear weapons. A leader who plans mass destruction, together with weapons of mass destruction. What would have been left of our world?"" asked Peres. Aides later stated that Peres was referring to Iran. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also referred to Iran in his remarks at Yad Vashem. ""You wish to deny the right of existence of the Jewish state, and you are wrong to believe that the Jewish state was created only due to the Holocaust. The Holocaust only underscored the necessity of its creation and the horrible price that the Jewish people had to pay for the lack of existence of a state that can shelter them,"" said Olmert. Other speakers at Yad Vashem emphasized the importance of the Israel Defense Forces, Israel's military forces, to prevent tragedies such as the Holocaust in the future. 4=Gabi Ashkenazi Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi, military chief of staff of Israel, led an annual march of Jewish youths, Poles and survivors at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland, in a memorial ceremony called The March of the Living. Auschwitz-Birkenau operated as a Nazi death camp during the Holocaust. 12,000 people gathered from 52 countries to take part in the memorial ceremony. The largest march took place in 2005, and former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon joined with 20,000 people. ""... in these days, as we celebrate 60 years of independence, the fact that an independent Jewish state exists is not something to be taken for granted. Even today, we hear the horrible sounds of those who call for the destruction of the state of Israel. Even today we are forced to continue and fight for our right to have a national home in a safe place for the Jewish people in their own land. We have learned our lesson and we take very seriously the threats of state leaders who call for the destruction of Israel,"" said Ashkenazi. Hamas television Thursday suggested that the Holocaust was organized by Jews to wipe out the disabled among their own people to prepare for the creation of a Jewish state. ""The Israeli Holocaust - the whole thing was a joke, and part of the perfect show that (Zionist leader and future Israeli prime minister) Ben Gurion put on,"" said head of the Palestinian Centre for Strategic Research Amin Dabur, according to Jerusalem-based Palestinian Media Watch. Dabur said that the ""young energetic and able"" went to Israel, and that those who were disabled were sent ""so there would be a Holocaust"". Though Iran has said that its nuclear program is peaceful in nature, the United States, Israel, and other countries believe it is attempting to construct nuclear weapons. In speeches Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Ahmadinejad has called the Holocaust ""a myth"". Tehran hosted a revisionist Holocaust conference in 2006, which provoked international criticism. Tel Aviv University published a study on Monday saying that acts of anti-Semitism in 2007 increased by about seven percent over 2006."

""This area ... is one of the poorest and most heavily affected by the recent conflict,"" she added. 4=Christine van Nieuwenhuyse, WFP representative WFP officials said that they have begun to give bread to 15,000 new recipients, a number which added to the already large group of people that had been lining up for bread after two years of Israeli blockades of Gaza, the most recent of which began in early November. The blockades, surely a catalyst for violent Hamas attacks, have been condemned by Human Rights Watch as a ""violation of international humanitarian law."" Struggling Gazan hospitals say that they are completely out of even the most basic medical supplies and have little or no capacity to deal with further casualties. In addition, Israeli ground forces entered Gaza on Saturday causing an immediate spike in casualties and even attacks on the hospitals and paramedics themselves. As sewage runs through the streets, many Gazans are trying to flee the area by storming the border with Egypt, a move which Egyptian police blocked on Sunday and are planning to do so again today as Egyptian leaders ordered their policemen to open fire on Gazans trying to flee into Egypt. Hasan Khalaf, Gaza's assistant deputy health minister, described the ongoing assault on Gaza as ""an Israeli massacre"". ""There is no comparison between what we have and what Israel are doing to us. The international community are standing unable to help us, and yet we know they have been helping Israel for tens of years."""
politics,"Somalia On Saturday, May 19, a ship chartered by the United Nations' (UN) World Food Programme (WFP), came under attack off the coast of Somalia after making a delivery in Merca. Two speedboats with armed guards were sent out to intercept the attack. One of these men was killed. The ship which was headed to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, did not fall into the hands of the pirates. Since the attack, WFP has suspended deliveries by ship. Shipping is the main and fastest way of getting food relief into Somalia. This comes just days after WFP announced that it was stepping up food deliveries. ""This attack underscores the growing problem of piracy off Somalia which, if unresolved, will sever the main artery of food assistance to the country – and to the people who rely on it for their survival,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the WFP in a news release. ""Unless action is taken now, not only will our supply lines be cut, but also those of other aid agencies working in various parts of Somalia."" ""WFP is very saddened and alarmed by the death of the guard, who showed great courage while the ship came under attack. We send our sincere condolences to his family,"" she continued. ""We urge key nations to do their utmost to address this plague of piracy, which is now threatening our ability to feed one million Somalis."" 4=Josette Sheeran, WFP ""We are not taking any risks after being victims four times. We planned to go to Somali this week but following Saturday's incident our ship will not sail,"" said Karim Kudrat who owns MV Rozen, which was hijacked in February and released forty days later upon payment of ransom. The United States Navy's Maritime Liaison Office (MARLO) in Bahrain has issued a warning, advising all ships to stay at least 200 nautical miles (NM) off the coast of Somalia. This month alone, four ships have been hijacked by pirates and three of them are still being held. Two of the ships, South Korean fishing trawlers, were boarded some 210 NM off the coast, which is outside of Somalia's Exclusive Economic Zone. Scores of crewmembers remain hostages. The sailors are said to be from China, India, Vietnam and South Korea. ""Attacks have sprung up again because we believe there is no government in place to control the militants ... when the Islamists were in power there were no attacks,"" Cyrus Moday, a senior analyst at the International Maritime Bureau told Reuters. An anonymous maritime security expert told BBC News: ""We have evidence that the pirates have a main contact in Puntland and it's up to the interim government in Somalia to track and arrest the contact for taking part in an illegal syndicate."" “In the hope of enriching themselves, these pirates are very cruelly playing with the lives of the most vulnerable women and children who had to leave their homes because of fighting. We appeal to the Somali authorities to act to stop these pirates before they cause more misery both to the crews of hijacked ships and to the people who rely on WFP food for their survival,” Peter Goossens, director of WFP Somalia, said. Alleged pirates sometimes call themselves coast guards, claiming to protect Somali waters from polluters and illegal fishing."
politics,"United Nations On Tuesday, Riyad Mansour, Palestine's ambassador to the United Nations, confirmed Palestine would preside next year over the UN's G-77 bloc of developing countries. While speaking to The New York Times, Mansour said, ""We will be negotiating on behalf of 135 countries"". Formed in 1964, Group of 77 now represents about 80% of the world population. Palestine is expected to take over presiding for 2019 in January. Currently, the presiding nation is Egypt. Palestine is an observer non-member state of the UN. In 2012, Israel and its ally the United States opposed promoting Palestine to ""observer"" status, and in 2015 both countries also opposed allowing Palestine to fly their flag at the UN. Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon criticised Palestine's presiding, saying, ""The goal of the Group of 77 originally was to facilitate the economic advancement of underdeveloped nations ... It is unfortunate that it will now become a platform for spreading lies and incitement. This will not promote the G-77's goals, and encourages the Palestinians to not engage in negotiations for peace."""
politics,"PakistanPakistan's Supreme Court yesterday criticised official handling of the murder of politician Benazir Bhutto. Since her death, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which she led, has gained control of the nation. A number of high-profile politicians are suspects in the killing but nobody has been convicted. Bhutto's former protocol minister Chaudhry Aslam petitioned the court to ensure a new First Information Report (FIR) was issued against a number of suspects, allowing them to be investigated. Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry The court approved his request and questioned the PPP's opposition to a new FIR. It also questioned Aslam's failure to approach the court earlier. Twelve suspects are named, including ex-President Pervez Musharraf, Interior Minister Rehman Malik, ex-Intelligence Bureau director general Ijaz Shah, former acting Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz and ex-Chief Minister of Punjab Pervaiz Elahi. The court further asked all suspects to relinquish positions of authority. ""How can a sub-inspector have enough courage to probe someone at the helm of affairs?"" asked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, sitting on a bench of three alongside Justice Tariq Parvez and Justice Khilji Arif Hussain. They said a fair investigation could not be carried out as long as suspects were in power. The court also had questions concerning a report into the murder compiled by the United Nations: ""Why did the government not publish the UN Commission report on which Rs60 million of the taxpayers' money was spent? Why have no steps been taken in the light of the report? Why was the murder of an internationally acclaimed leader not been taken up in the assemblies and relevant parliamentary forums?"" Interior Minister Malik, named on the new FIR, and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, another PPP minister, had opposed another FIR. Malik had claimed it was needless as other suspects had been charged. The court rejected this, saying the implication was the case should therefore cease to be heard. Malik's lawyer sought a week to for his client to lodge a reply, to which Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry retorted ""You want to create obstacles in the proceedings? How much longer do you want to linger?"", adding Malik should appear in person before the court. The Benazir Bhutto case is back before the Supreme Court on April 24."

Saberi was jailed in Iran on charges of spying, and prior to her release shared a cell with Harotonian. Harotonian was working on a healthcare project for the organization International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX). She was convicted of attempting to initiate a revolution, and received a sentence in January of three years in jail. 4=Roxana Saberi ""By arresting people like her, certain hardliners have created an atmosphere of fear within Iranian society that anyone who has practically any contact with foreigners... would be accused of acting against national security,"" said Saberi at the press conference.

Saberi was joined in her efforts on behalf of her former cellmate by International Federation for the League of Human Rights president Karim Lahidji, International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran coordinator Hadi Ghaemi, and IREX president Robert Pearson. Saberi has dual-citizenship as an Iranian-American, and she grew up in Fargo, North Dakota. She lived in Iran for six years while working as a journalist for news media organizations including the BBC. On January 31, four members of the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran took her from her home to face charges of spying for the United States. She was convicted and sentenced to eight years in jail, however this was reduced to a suspended sentence of two years. After returning to the United States, Saberi met with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."
politics,"Same-sex marriage in Australia The Australian Democrats deputy leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett moved in the Australian Senate a bill to amend the Marriage Act to provide for same-sex marriages. Senator Bartlett's second reading speech which was incorporated into the Hansard described that the bill ""reverses the Marriage Amendment Act 2004...which...changed the definition to that of a union between one man and one woman only"", and refuted arguments against same-sex marriage proposed by some conservative Government senators. Bartlett continued to say that ""We do not want to send the message that discrimination is acceptable in Australia"" to our children, or to other nations."" The federal Government is opposed to civil unions. In an interview on June 8, Prime Minister John Howard said, ""I don’t see it in any way as discriminating against homosexuals, it’s not, it’s designed to preserve the special status of marriage in our community and that’s what it’s all about.""

politics,"During the opening day of the 61st annual UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Iranian President Ahmadinejad used his address to challenge the effectiveness of the UN Security Council. ""Can a council in which they Britain are privileged members address their violations? Has this ever happened?"" President Ahmadinejad asked the assembly. ""In fact we have repeatedly seen the reverse."" ""The persistence of some hegemonic powers in imposing their exclusionist policies on international decision making mechanisms, including the Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust in global public opinion, undermining the credibility and effectiveness of this most universal system of collective security,"" President Ahmadinejad said. The US President Bush address earlier on Tuesday spoke both to the assembly and the world Islamic population. ""Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed &amp;mdash; it must be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are making the choice for freedom. And the nations gathered in this chamber must make a choice, as well: Will we support the moderates and reformers who are working for change across the Middle East &amp;mdash; or will we yield the future to the terrorists and extremists?"" President Bush asked. ""My country desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war against Islam. This propaganda is false and its purpose is to confuse you and justify acts of terror,"" said President Bush. ""We must seek stability through a free and just Middle East where the extremists are marginalized by millions of citizens in control of their own destinies."" ""To the people of Iran,"" President Bush said, ""You deserve an opportunity to determine your own future, an economy that rewards your intelligence and your talents, and a society that allows you to fulfill your tremendous potential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that your rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use your nation's resources to fund terrorism, and fuel extremism, and pursue nuclear weapons."" President Ahmadinejad was not present for the mid-afternoon address by President Bush. Ahmadinejad also did not attend the UN's traditional banquet for visiting presidents, princes and prime ministers, where dignitaries have a chance to mix informally, because alcohol (the consumption of which is forbidden in Islam) was served at the banquet.

politics,"The largest class action in Victorian history was commenced at the Supreme Court of Victoria on Friday the 13th by Slidders Lawyers against electricity distribution company SP AusNet and the Brumby Government in relation to the Kilmore East fire that became part of the Kinglake complex. Because of the lawsuit, SP AusNet SPN.AX's shares on Monday have dropped more than 13.36 per cent or 14.5 cents, to an intra-day low of 94 cents, was at 98.5 cents at 10:38 a.m. local time, before recovering slightly to be 7.5 cents lower at A$1.01 by 1144 AEDT (0003 GMT) or 6.9 percent in Sydney trading. Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday. Power supplier SP AusNet said it has asked the Victoria Court regarding the status of the class action proceedings saying the firm had insurance policies in place consistent with industry standards. ""SP AusNet will continue to update the market as further information becomes available,"" the company said. The claim has focused on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. It maintains most of the power lines in eastern Victoria. Its fallen power line is believed to have sparked the blaze that tore through Kinglake, Steels Creek, Strathewen, Humevale, and St Andrews. The plaintiffs include thousands of angry Kinglake farmers, small business owners, tourist operators and residents who lost homes. Leo Keane, the lead plaintiff in the class action has alleged ""SP AusNet owed a duty of care to landowners to operate and manage power lines in a way that limited the risk of damage from bushfires."" On Thursday Phoenix Taskforce had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line in Kilmore East that fell during strong winds and record heat about 11am last Saturday. It was believed to have started the fire there, since within minutes a nearby pine forest was ablaze, and within six hours the bushfire had almost obliterated nearly every building in the towns in its path. ""It is believed that the claim will be made on the basis of negligent management of power lines and infrastructure,"" Slidders Lawyers partner Daniel Oldham said. The law firm has announced it was helping landowners and leaseholders get compensation for the 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009 bushfires. ""If you have been burnt by the recent bushfires, please register your interest using the form below as soon as possible,"" the law firm's website stated. The Insurance Council of Australia has placed the cost of the bushfires at about $500 million. ""That means keeping electricity lines clear of trees and in a condition that won't cause fires. They must also have systems in place to identify and prevent risks occurring,"" Melbourne barrister Tim Tobin, QC, said. According to the 2006 census, Kinglake had a population of almost 1,500 people. But SP AusNet's legal liability has been limited at $100 million under an agreement inked by the former Kennett government with private utility operators, when the former State Electricity Commission was privatized in 1995. Accordingly, the Brumby Government could be legally obliged to pay damages of the differences amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. SP AusNet Ltd said some of its electricity assets have been damaged by the Victoria bushfire. ""As a preliminary estimate, it is thought that damage has been sustained to approximately one per cent of SP AusNet’s electricity distribution network, mainly distribution poles, associated conductors and pole top transformers,"" SP AusNet said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). It explained that up to 6,000 homes and businesses on its network were without power due to bushfires, including the Kinglake complex fire, Beechworth fire, and fires across Gippsland including Churchill and Bunyip. SP AusNet said the firm will cooperate fully and will assist in any fire probe. ""We stand ready to assist the relevant authorities with their inquiries if it is necessary for us to do so now and in the coming months,"" SP Ausnet spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in a statement. ""Our priority is to restore power to fire-affected areas as quickly as possible. We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim. If the claim is pursued, SP AusNet advises that it has liability insurance which provides cover for bushfire liability. The company's bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies,"" Grahams explained. Victorian Auditor-General Rob Hulls said ""there was an 'unseemly rush' by some lawyers to sue before the cause of the fires had been fully investigated."" ""The government body had audited the network's bushfire risk to make sure required distances between power lines and vegetation were maintained. Power companies had been given a clean bill of health, and electricity firms were judged to be 'well prepared for the 2008-09 bushfire season.' There were no regulations applying to the distances between poles supporting electricity lines and spans of one kilometre were not unusual,"" a spokesman for Energy Safe Victoria explained. Christine Nixon, the 19th and current Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police said investigations into the cause of the bushfires were ongoing. ""I know people are angry, and so are all of us in this community. But we need to kind of have a sense that the proper processes are in place and we need to go through the investigation and through the court case,"" Nixon said. ""At this stage we are not able to confirm how it started. I understand there is some legal action that people are taking, but at this stage we're still investigating its cause. But the whole circumstances of that fire are part of our Taskforce Phoenix, and as we move through that we'll be able to tell the community more once we're able to confirm or deny what we think is the cause of these fires,"" Nixon added. On Thursday, two people were arrested in connection with the fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour; although they were both released without charges laid. Brendan Sokaluk, age 39, from Churchill in the Gippsland region, was arrested by police at 4pm on Thursday, in relation to the Churchill fires, and was questioned at the Morwell police station. He was charged on Friday with one count each of arson, intentionally lighting a bushfire and possession of child pornography. The arson case relates to 11 of the 21 deaths in the dire Gippsland fire, which devastated 39,000 hectares in the Latrobe Valley, Calignee, Hazelwood Koornalla and Jeeralang. Two teams of Churchill firefighters were almost lost in the inferno that remains out of control. Mr Sokaluk joined the CFA Churchill brigade in the late 1980s as a volunteer fire fighter, left in the 1990s and attempted to rejoin twice, but was rejected. He failed to appear in Melbourne Magistrate's Court Monday for a scheduled hearing, since the court reset the committal hearing on May 25. He is represented by lawyer Julian McMahon. Magistrate John Klestadt has lifted the suppression order which kept the suspect's identity a secret but identifying photographs were barred from being released. Mr Sokaluk was remanded in protective custody from Morwell to a cell in Melbourne for his own safety amid fears angry prisoners will target him and real risk of vigilante attacks. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment if convicted on the arson charge. ""This is an extraordinary case. The level of emotion and anger and disgust that the alleged offenses have aroused in the community is unprecedented."" Mr Sokaluk's defense lawyer Helen Spowart argued. The prosecution has moved the Court for more time to prepare its case, saying there would be up to 200 witnesses to interview. Slater &amp; Gordon has indicated that they were awaiting the report of the to-be-established Royal Commission, expected in late 2010, before initiating any claims. Armed with a $40 million budget, the Royal Commission's Chair Justice Bernard Teague will be assisted by former Commonwealth ombudsman Ron McLeod, who led the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and State Services Authority Commissioner Susan Pascoe. The Commission has said its interim report is due on August 17 while the final report will be submitted by July 31, 2010. Judge Bernard Teague has announced Tuesday he will meet with fire victims and fire authorities within the next two weeks. ""We want to do that as soon as possible - probably not next week but starting to have these discussions the week after,"" he said. Julia Eileen Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and deputy leader of the federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) said the federal and Victorian governments would respond quickly to the royal commission's report. ""Everybody who has lived through this experience in Victoria and around the nation has asked the question: 'Why? What can we do better?'. No one wanted to see the report ""as a book on a shelf gathering dust,"" she said. Victoria bushfire experts, led by Forest Fire Victoria - a group of scientists and forestry experts - have condemned the government's ""Living with Fire"" policy and the state's failure to initiate serious fuel-reduction programs. The Victoria government had failed to seriously act on bushfire safety recommendations submitted last June by the Victorian Parliamentary Environment and Natural Resources Committee. As death toll rises, evidence mounts of lack of planning prior to Australia’s worst bushfire. ""Living with Fire"" policy means Kinglake fire trucks were dispatched to an earlier fire in Kilmore, leaving Kinglake undefended. ""Kinglake was left with no fire brigade and no police. The trucks had been sent to Kilmore. I've been in the fire brigade for 10 years. There was always a law—the trucks had to be on the hill. Because of the government we got gutted at Kinglake. They should have been getting generators ahead of the fire—so people would have had a chance of fighting it. As soon as the power went, I couldn't keep fighting the fire at my place,"" Rick and Lauren Watts, and their friend Neil Rao, spoke to the WSWS. Rick has also criticized the lack of early warning communications systems, since emergency siren warnings in the town had been stopped some years earlier. Humevale resident Sina Imbriano who has six children was angry about the failure of state and federal governments to set up a recommended telephone warning system amid its ""stay and defend or go"" policy. Bald Spur Road residents Greg Jackson and his wife Fotini said the government's ""stay and defend or go"" policy was ""fruitless"" since the critical issue was early warnings, but ""they the government just won't spend the money."" Also on Friday, five law firms from Victoria's Western Districts, including Warrnambool-based Maddens Lawyers and Brown &amp; Proudfoot, held a meeting to discuss a potential class action in relation to the Horsham fire, which was also thought to have been started by fallen power pole that burnt vast swathes of land in Mudgegonga and Dederang, Victoria. The lawsuit will also focus on the fire that blackened about 1750 hectares at Coleraine. Maddens senior attorney Brendan Pendergast said: ""We don't know who the defendant is at this stage. We are unsure who the electrical supplier is for that area but we should know in a few days. There were people who had their homes burnt to the ground and they will need to reconstruct, replace their contents,"" he said. Maddens has initiated a register of affected landowners for the recent bushfires, saying the firm has included victims of the Pomborneit fire that burnt almost 1300 hectares in the proposed class action amid the CFA's statement the blaze could have been deliberately lit. Frances Esther ""Fran"" Bailey, Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives (1990-93 and 1996-present), representing the electorate of McEwen in Victoria said the Country Fire Authority (CFA) had told her one of the power lines had broken before the fire. ""The local CFA Country Fire Authority told me on that Saturday, with those very high winds, one of the lines had broken and was whipping against the ground and sparked,"" she said. ""Whether or not that is the cause of that terrible fire that actually took out Kinglake and maybe Marysville, the investigations will prove that, but we've got to do better,"" she added. Victorian Premier John Brumby said the power line claim would be examined as part of the Royal Commission into the bushfire. ""No stone will be left unturned. So, I think it's important the Royal Commission does its work. And, the Royal Commission will, of course, look at all of the factors with the fires,"" Mr Brumby said. At least 550 houses were incinerated and 100 people have been killed, leaving more than 1,000 homeless in the Kinglake bushfire and surrounding areas.

SP is involved in a major investment in Australia's Alinta in partnership with Babcock &amp; Brown, after putting up a bid of A$13.9 billion (S$17 billion), beating out a rival bid by Macquarie Bank. The devastating 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, a series of more than 400 bushfires across Victoria on February 7 2009, is Australia's worst-ever bushfire disaster, claiming at least 200 deaths, including many young children, and is expected to pass 300. 100 victims have been admitted to hospitals across Victoria with burns, at least 20 in a critical condition, and 9 on life support or in intensive care. The fires have destroyed at least 1,834 homes and damaged many thousands more. Many towns north-east of Melbourne have been badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen and Flowerdale. Over 500 people suffered fire-related injuries and more than 7,000 are homeless. It has scorched more than 1,500 square miles (3,900 square kilometers) of farms, forests and towns. The Supreme Court of Victoria is the superior court for the State of Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1852, it is a superior court of common law and equity, with unlimited jurisdiction within the state. Those courts lying below it include the County Court of Victoria, the Magistrates' Court of Victoria and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (which is technically not a court, but serves a judicial function). Above it lies the High Court of Australia. This places it around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy."
politics,"The head of the Melo Commission announced they had recommended that retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr. and other commanders be ""held responsible for the extrajudicial killings in their respective areas during their tours of duty"". Melo commission, formed in August 2006 by the president to look into the spate of politically related killings after local and international clamor, submitted the 89-page report of the commission to the president last week but the findings have not yet been made public. Retired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo said holding military commanders responsible for extrajudicial killings was one of the recommendations in the final report. Melo reportedly said the investigation of the four-member panel showed that “majority of the victims were leftist-activist-militants” and that the suspected assailants belonged to the military. He clarified though that they ""don’t want to tag the whole military establishment"", adding that ""only elements of the military who were allowed to do their thing without supervision from higher officers."" He attributed ""some of the killings to politicians, some to the security guards of landlords,"" but Melo pointed to the military elements for majority of the killings. Earlier, another member of the commission, Butuan City Bishop Juan de Dios Pueblos, on Saturday said the military was involved in some attacks of leftists. ""We have identified that there are killings really perpetuated by the military,"" he said. He remarked that the Melo Commission has recommended to President Arroyo that military commanders be held criminally liable if one of their subordinates were found guilty of political murders. ""We are suggesting the criminalization of the command responsibility in order to put more teeth in the aspect of peace and to stop the killings,"" the Bishop said. Commission head Melo also confirmed, report said, that among those mentioned in the fact-finding report was Palparan, who retired in September 2006. Leftist groups had labeled Palparan “berdugo” (butcher) for the spate of killings during his tenure as commander in Mindoro, Samar, and Nueva Ecija provinces. ""He has said he inspired them. You can hook the fish through the mouth,” Melo said, referring to a media interview given by Palparan where he admitted he had ""inspired"" some people to ""punish"" suspected communist New People’s Army rebels who had committed crimes in their communities. Palparan was one of four military officials who testified before the commission. They were the only witnesses who responded to the commission’s summonses. Leftist groups and families of victims had boycotted the hearings of the commission, saying it lacked credibility and independence. For his part, Jovito Palparan admitted on Monday that some soldiers could be involved in extrajudicial killings of left-wing activists. ""It's possible,"" Palparan was heard saying in a radio interview, noting that ""some soldiers are victims so it's not surprising that some get angry because it's their lives on the line."" Meanwhile, human rights group Karapatan called on the Melo Commission on Monday to recommend punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, which, it said, mostly came from the military. Dorris Cuario, secretary general of regional chapter of Karapatan in Southern Tagalog, said the initial report of the commission was not enough to solve the unabated political killings in the country. Southern Tagalog covers the province of Mindoro where Palparan's assignment as military commander coincided with escalation of human rights violations reportedly perpetrated by military elements. ""We hope the report is not just a facade of the commission to make people believe it was doing something,"" she said. Cuario challenged the Melo Commission ""to serve justice"" by demanding for the punishment not only of the low-ranking policemen and soldiers but also of AFP generals and even Ms. Arroyo, whom Cuario and other militant groups point to as the masterminds of the killings. Aside from Melo and Bishop de Dios Pueblos, the other commission members were National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, and University of the Philippines Regent Nelia Gonzales."

politics,"After an investigation of allegations that Islam's holy book the Qu'ran was mishandled in front of inmates at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the Bush administration has acknowledged the credibility of some of these reports. According to Robert Burns of the Associated Press, U.S. military officials acknowledged that, ""a Muslim holy book was splashed with urine,"" and ""a detainee's Quran was deliberately kicked and another's was stepped on."" The US government first denied a specific report that the Qu'ran had been flushed down a toilet at the prison facility, but on Friday agreed that similar allegations were indeed true. On May 16, Newsweek magazine apologized to the victims of deadly riots that ensued due to a Newsweek article stating that U.S. officials defiled the Qur'an. White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan criticized Newsweek's initial response to the incident, saying it was ""puzzling."" Later that day, Newsweek retracted the story, which the White House said was a ""good first step"". On May 20, the International Red Cross (IRC) revealed in a rare public announcement that it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Qur'an by Guantanamo Bay personnel. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on ""rare occasions"" but were uncorroborated. Simon Schorno, a Red Cross spokesman, disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, ""All information we received were corroborated allegations."" He added that, ""We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves,"" and that ""the ICRC considers such reports ""very seriously, and very carefully, and we document everything."" Scott McClellan explained in a press conference that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print. McClellan said, ""Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad. And Newsweek has said that they got it wrong. I think Newsweek recognizes the responsibility they have. We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story. Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report. And that's all I'm saying. But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."" On May 25, Amnesty International called for the shutdown on Guantanamo Bay due to numerous human rights violations, saying ""The 'war on terror' appeared more effective in eroding international human rights principles than in countering international 'terrorism'."" Amnesty International's view was shared by both the International Red Cross (IRC) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an. In the foreword of the report, written by Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan, Guantanamo was compared to a Soviet-era gulag in that it is ""entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law"". White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were ""ridiculous and unsupported by the facts. The United States is leading the way when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting human dignity. We have liberated 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have worked to advance freedom and democracy in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for minority rights, that women's rights are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot"", as well as supporting the fight against AIDS in Africa. About the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, ""We hold people accountable when there is abuse. We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in."" On May 31, U.S. President George W. Bush dismissed the human rights report as ""absurd"" for its harsh criticism of U.S. treatment of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying the allegations were made by prisoners ""who hate America."" ""It's an absurd allegation. The United States is a country that promotes freedom around the world,"" Bush said of the Amnesty International report. William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, defended the report, saying, ""What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration."" and ""What is 'absurd' and indeed outrageous is the Bush administration's failure to undertake a full independent investigation"". Irene Khan also responded saying, ""The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them."" And, on Friday, the U.S. military released the results of their investigation and confirmed that in 5 separate incidents, American guards at the Guantánamo Bay prison ""mishandled"" the Islamic holy book. However, they stress that guards were usually ""respectful"" of the Qur'an. One incident involved splashing a Koran with urine by urinating near an air vent while others involved kicking, stepping on and writing in Qur'ans. Brigadier-General Jay Hood, the commander of the jail, looked into the allegations, published and then retracted by Newsweek, that American personnel flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. He said that the inquiry did not find any evidence supporting this particular allegation. ""The inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. This matter is considered closed."""
politics,"Texas Senate Bill 6 requires foster agencies to inquire of adopting couples their sexual preference. This bill has caused distress to many, especially among the gay and lesbian community. Representative Robert Talton claims that compared with children raised by a heterosexual couple, those in same-sex households are much more likely to become homosexual. Talton has also stated that sexual orientation is a choice for the parents: ""If they choose to be homosexual or lesbian, that's their choice when they turn 18,"" he says, regarding the same-sex couples. Under the bill he proposes, couples who answer 'same-sex' or 'bi-sexual' on the questionnaire, would not be allowed to adopt or foster children. Children fostered currently to same-sex households would be removed from their foster-parent's care. ""Some of us believe they would be better off in orphanages than in a homosexual or bisexual households because that's a learned behavior,"" the Republican congressman said. There are reportedly thousands of children in same-sex households in Texas who would be removed, if this bill is passed. ""It's very traumatic to remove a child from a stable home,"" said Colin Cunliff, field director for the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. ""It's the whole reason they're in the foster system, because their prior home wasn't stable. You're adding to the instability."" According to a 2002 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children with homosexual parents have the ""same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment and development as children whose parents are heterosexual."" A similar law passed in Arkansas was ruled unconstitutional in December."
politics,"politics and conflicts On Monday Nigerian authorities raised the official death toll from January 17's airstrike upon a refugee camp to 236, though the BBC on Tuesday reported an official told them this was an error and the actual figure was 115. The military said at the time a jet mistook refugees for rebels. 4=Aid worker Alfred Davies The new toll updates previous estimates, which at the time of the incident were of at least 50 dead. The BBC on Tuesday reported an official told them the figure of 236 was erroneously reached by combining the numbers of dead and wounded. The camp in Rann, Borno State is home to thousands and lies near the northeastern border with Cameroon. Home to those displaced by Boko Haram insurgents, the camp is in an area suffering famine. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross was there to distribute food when the attack happened. Twenty Nigerian Red Cross workers were injured or killed. Médecins Sans Frontières are treating the majority of the wounded in makeshift tents in Rann, which lacks hospital facilities. A small number have been evacuated to Maiduguri. Military officials said at the time the Air Force had been dispatched to Rann after reports of ""remnants"" of Boko Haram in the area. The military claims it is in a ""final push"" against the rebel group. A promised investigation has materialised in the form of a panel of Air Force officials, with orders to complete the probe by the end of next week. Human Rights Watch have called for compensation for victims. They say the military is not absolved of liability and suggest the camp's tents were obvious. Eyewitnesses say the aircraft circled twice, dropping multiple bombs, which appears corroborated by satellite imagery. President Muhammadu Buhari called it a ""regrettable operational mistake"" and has since departed for a holiday in London. Journalists are barred from the military-controlled camp. Officials claim all the dead in Rann have been buried, and two more died in hospital in Maiduguri. Most of those killed were women and children. Soldiers were also amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses claim two days after the disaster in excess of 100 Boko Haram militants attacked the camp, fighting with soldiers for hours. MSF field co-ordinator Alfred Davies said, ""There are no words to describe the chaos... I saw the bodies of children that had been cut in two."" MSF have called for ""a transparent account"" with the organisation's general director complaining refugees ""were bombed by those who were meant to safeguard them"". Some humanitarian groups have suggested the incident constitutes a war crime even as an accident, and Human Rights Watch is urging an independent probe. They say 35 structures were destroyed at two separate locations within the camp. ""We saw dozens of patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including open fractures and wounds to the abdomen and chest,"" said MSF doctor Mohammed Musoke. He described wounded children, including a crying baby with shrapnel in its neck and ""a 10-year-old boy with a large, deep flesh wound to his thigh. The flesh was hanging loose on one side and you could see through to the bone."" Survivor Baba, 37, a refugee, said military aircraft were not an uncommon sight but the attacking jet behaved abnormally. ""The plane flew back and forth, and we knew something was wrong before the bombing happened."" His remarks were released by MSF. Prior to the attacks camp residents had been starving, some dying from malnutrition. War and substandard infrastructure left Rann isolated, and the attack came as the Red Cross were about to distribute food they had just arrived with. The Red Cross say they have five weeks' worth of food. The International NGO Safety Organisation claims 2016 saw in excess of 90 aid workers killed worldwide, with 154 injured."
politics,"Libya The United Nations Security Council has approved the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya after a vote on Thursday evening. A meeting in New York City resulted in the approval of a resolution that would mark the beginning of ""all necessary measures short of an occupation force to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas"" in Libya. The vote on the measure passed with ten of the fifteen members of the Security Council in support and Russia, China, India, Germany and Brazil absenting. The resolution had been proposed by the United Kingdom, France and Lebanon. In his remarks introducing the measure before the Council, Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said that ""we cannot let these warmongers do this, we cannot abandon civilians."" Air attacks on government forces in Libya could take place within hours, flown by the French and British air forces, after NATO meets to review plans for military action. In response to the vote, a statement aired on Libyan state TV said that ""any foreign military act against Libya will expose all air and maritime traffic in the Mediterranean Sea to danger, and civilian and military facilities will become targets of Libya's counterattack."" Libya's ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, also said that government troops planned to move against Benghazi Thursday night. ""No more fear, no more hesitation, the moment of truth has come. ... There will be no mercy. Our troops will be coming to Benghazi tonight."" The UK ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, said after the vote that ""the international community has come together in deploring the actions of the Gaddafi regime and demanding that the regime end this violence against the Libyan people."" In Benghazi, rebels celebrated the passage of the resolution with fireworks after a live broadcast of the vote was shown on an outdoor projection."
politics,"One day after Maine became the fifth state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage and Washington, D.C. passed a bill to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, televangelist Pat Robertson condemned the act of marriage between individuals of the same sex. On Thursday, Robertson compared its legalization to pedophilia, polygamy and child molestation while hosting the television show The 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network. During the broadcast Robertson asked ""How can we rule that polygamy is illegal when you say that homosexual marriage is legal? What is it about polygamy that’s different? Well, polygamy was outlawed because it was considered immoral according to biblical standards. But if we take biblical standards away in homosexuality, what about the other? And what about bestiality and ultimately what about child molestation and pedophilia?"" Robertson then went on to query, ""How can we criminalize these things and at the same time have constitutional amendments allowing same-sex marriage among homosexuals. You mark my words, this is just the beginning in a long downward slide in relation to all the things that we consider to be abhorrent."" Robertson's comments come after the Council of the District of Columbia voted in favor to recognize same-sex marriages performed anywhere outside the District. The measure passed the council 12 votes for with 1 against. Congress has 30 days post-signing to either let it stand or veto. D.C. is not a state and Congress has oversight of the Council. ""To say 'well, I support domestic partnership or I support civil union' as a way to say 'I'm not that big a bigot,' and that's what it is,"" said David Catania, an openly gay member of the D.C. council. Robertson's comments have made headlines in the past. In August of 2005, Robertson called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, for which he apologized two days later. In January 2006, Robertson said that former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was ""divine retribution"" for pulling Israelis out of the Gaza Strip."
politics,"2016 US Presidential Election United States Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders discussed his understanding of the Black Lives Matter movement on Monday. ""Many white people are not sensitive"", Sanders noted, speaking with magazine Ebony, ""to the kind of abuse that African-Americans, especially younger African-Americans, receive at the hands of police officers and police departments"". The Black Lives Matter activist movement protests police brutality against African Americans, and gained traction after the death of Michael Brown last year in Ferguson, Missouri. Sanders also recently admitted, speaking to magazine The New Yorker, that when the Black Lives Matter movement first came to light, he mishandled his dealings with them: ""I plead guilty — I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue ... The issues these young people raised are enormously important"". Senator Sanders has had several incidents involving the group, including when they interrupted one of his rallies in Seattle in August. He said talking with members of the movement has helped him understand what the movement is about. Sanders has been strongly criticized for his previous treatment of the group, particularly when his campaign began to respond to interruption from the group by shouting ""we stand together"" repeatedly at them. The Senator for Vermont in his Ebony interview called the US criminal justice system ""broken"", saying, ""One of the ongoing crises in America is institutional racism""."
politics,"Iraq The Iraq Inquiry in London has revealed that United Kingdom justice secretary Jack Straw ignored the advice of Sir Michael Wood, the Foreign Office's most senior legal adviser until his resignation in 2006, that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was illegal under international law. This is the first time that Wood has publicly expressed an opinion on the war. Wood advised Straw, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, that invading Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council in the form of a specific mandate—which the resolution the government used to support the war lacked—would ""amount to the crime of aggression"", to which Straw responded that he was being ""dogmatic and international law was pretty vague"". Wood disputes this, saying, ""Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain. This, however, turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear."" source=Sir Michael Wood He says that it was unprecedented for the government to ignore his advice, and told the inquiry that he ""considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law,"" since the Security Council had not met to approve the use of force, nor to agree that Iraq was committing a ""material breach"" of existing disarmament resolutions. He believed that regime change was the reason for the British interest in the nation, and that it was not a valid reason for war. He told the inquiry, ""I made it clear that, in my view, the draft that they were working toward did not authorize the use of force without a further decision of the Security Council"". Recently declassified letters prove that Wood raised these concerns directly with Jack Straw. In one of these letters, dated January 24, 2003, Wood said that the ""UK cannot lawfully use force in Iraq in ensuring compliance"" with UN resolutions (including resolution 1441, which gave Saddam Hussein a ""final opportunity"" to comply with the UN's mandates on weapons of mass destruction by November 2002). In his reply, Straw ""noted"", but ""did not accept"" Wood's advice. Straw said he was ""as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations"". He also said that ""it is an uncertain field. In this case, the issue is an arguable one, capable of honestly and reasonably held differences of view."" He said he wanted a new UN resolution ""for political reasons"", but said that there was a ""strong case"" that existing resolutions would ""provide a sufficient basis in international law to justify military action"". Do you think the war in Iraq was illegal? Instead of following Wood's advice, government ministers used the advice of Lord Goldsmith, who was then the Attorney General for England and Wales. Goldsmith—who is scheduled to appear before the Inquiry this Wednesday—advised Straw that a second UN resolution would not be required to invade, based on a series of UN resolutions reaching back to the end of the Gulf War, despite having told the prime minister—only then days before—to wait for another UN resolution, the passing of which they had pushed other Security Council members for in the weeks running up to the invasion. Wood makes it clear, however, that the final decision regarding the legality of war lay with the Attorney General, rather than with himself. The inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, was told that there were concerns about how the decision was made among the Foreign Office's senior legal advisors. Elizabeth Wilmshurst, then Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, resigned in protest only days before the invasion. She criticised the decision-making process for its lack of transparency, and called it ""lamentable"". She also called the fact that Goldsmith gave his opinion only days before the invasion ""extraordinary"". source=Ed Davey Wood said that Straw had ""often been advised things were unlawful and gone ahead anyway and won in the courts"" when he was home secretary. Last week, Straw—when questioned by the inquiry—called the decision to support the war a ""profoundly difficult political and moral dilemma"", and said it was the ""most difficult"" decision of his entire career. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Wood's statement ""the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war."" He asks if the advice reached then prime minister Tony Blair or Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, ""And if not, why not?"" source=Gordon Brown Wood's statement is expected to cause problems for Tony Blair when he appears before the inquiry on Friday. The war has provoked protests, and much outrage among politicians who believe that Blair was wrong to support then United States President George W. Bush by sending 45,000 British soldiers—179 of whom died in combat—to fight in Iraq. The Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday, and Gordon Brown, the current prime minister, is scheduled before the general election (which is expected to occur in May). Brown said yesterday that he ""thinks the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary so that Iraq could recover quickly after Saddam Hussein fell,"" and is expected to come under fire from the inquiry, which he himself set up, for his role in the war."
politics,"France At least twelve people have been killed today in a shooting at the Paris offices of the satirical weekly French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Three men in hoods armed with Kalashnikov rifles entered the magazine's office in the 11th arrondissement and shot dead ten journalists and two police officers before making a getaway in a car driven by a fourth collaborator. Five people have been seriously injured in the attack. A member of the police said after leaving the scene the attackers drove to the northeastern suburbs of Paris where they abandoned their vehicle and hijacked another car. French police union Unité spokesman Rocco Contento said of the crime scene, ""it was a real butchery"". The French Government have raised the country's security level to the maximum. President François Hollande told reporters: ""This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it"". The French news website 20minutes.fr is reporting one eyewitness claimed that as the attackers approached the magazine's office, they shouted: you say to the media that it is al-Qaeda in Yemen. Gérard Biard, the editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, stated: ""I don't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war."" The magazine recently posted a cartoon on Twitter depicting Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a leader of the Islamic State militant group. US President Barack Obama gave a statement condemning the attack: ""France is America's oldest ally, and has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorists who threaten our shared security and the world. Time and again, the French people have stood up for the universal values that generations of our people have defended."" Obama also said that the US would provide assistance ""to help bring these terrorists to justice"". British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press."" The Arab League and the Cairo-based Al-Azhar University have also condemned the attack. In 2006, Charlie Hebdo ran the cartoons depicting Muhammad that originally appeared in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. In 2011, it published another cartoon depiction of Muhammed subtitled ""Charia Hebdo"", a pun on sharia. The magazine's office was subsequently firebombed. Following the bombing, the magazine's website was hacked and death threats were made against their staff. The magazine responded by publishing on their front page an image showing both the remains of the magazine's offices and one of their cartoonists kissing a bearded Muslim man. The cover contained the headline Love is stronger than hate."
politics,"DOLike everything the government does, it does a miserable job of educating children and spends way too much doing so. Private competitive schools, perhaps funded by vouchers, would be better. Public school systems have way too many administrators and lack accountability. Teacher unions have the same adverse effect on education that government employee unions have on other government ""services."" Let's give parents choices by eliminating the monopolistic, union-controlled schools. Competition works and freedom works. As far as the UC University of California system, it is a massive overfunded boondoggle. Higher education has been protected from price competition for many decades. The more government subsidizes education, the higher the price charged for that education with the result that the students and their parents end up paying as much as before. The cost of education has increased far faster than inflation over the past several decades. From what I've seen and read, most university professors are grossly underworked. They need to spend more time teaching; there needs to be more innovation in teaching to keep the cost down (like online education, but certainly not limited to that). Many of the services provided to students at our universities are more baby-sitting than education. We need real competition in education and we need to privatize our public universities. Let people keep their tax money and use it to decide where to go to school. I propose we sell the UC system to private owners and let it compete."

Sudan and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal last Friday to end the three year old civil war, claiming more than 200,000 lives. Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state will address the UN Security Council to help speed up the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the Darfur region. ""She's going to request a resolution that will accelerate the deployment of UN peacekeepers into Darfur,"" President Bush said. ""We're now working with the UN to identify countries that contribute those troops, so the peacekeeping effort will be robust."" The Government of Sudan had previously denied UN deployment. But, after the signing of the peace treaty, they have expressed their keenness on the deployment of UN peacekeepers. So far, there are around 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in Darfur, but they have failed to play any significant role to control the violence in the region. They are facing a serious shortage of funds and man-power. It had been two months since any soldier in the peacekeeping forces were paid, Nigerian envoy to the African Union confirmed yesterday. Ambassador Sam Ibok, Nigerian envoy to the AU said, ""There have been some cash flow problems, but that has been resolved now and troops will be paid in the next week or so. "" Chad, Sudan's neighbouring state, welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and the main faction of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement. Chad broke off diplomatic relations with Sudan on 14 April, a day after an attack on N’Djamena by rebel forces from Sudan. Also, Chad withdrew its delegation from African Union-brokered peace talks for Sudan’s troubled western Darfur region citing Sudanese aggression. Currently, there are more than 200,000 Darfur refugees. Foreign minister Ahmat Allami said, ""Chad welcomes the signing of the Abuja peace deal on Darfur between the warring Sudanese parties after a long period of negotiations."" Libya announced today that it would resume effort to normalize bilateral relations between Chad and Sudan. A Libyan official said a tripartite summit would be held soon."
politics,"Lawmakers in Massachusetts, located in the United States, have thrown out an amendment that would allow voters to vote for same-sex marriage, or against it in the 2008 general elections. ""Today's vote is not just a victory for marriage equality. It was a victory for equality itself,"" said Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick who voted against the amendment. President of the Massachusetts Family Institute Kristian Mineau, called the decision ""disappointing."" Fifty votes were needed to pass the amendment. Two hundred lawmakers sit on the state's session and in January voted for the amendment with 62 votes. In the recent session on Thursday, the amendment only received 45 support votes with 141 opposing the amendment, killing the measure until at least 2010. It would then require opponents of gay marriage to start from scratch, writing new petitions to the lawmakers, and then gaining the support of at least 50 of them, in at least two separate sessions. Same-sex marriages became legal in Massachusetts in 2004 after the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2003 the ban on gay marriage to be ""unconstitutional,"" and since then nearly 9,000 couples have gotten married there."
politics,"CanadaStephen Harper, Canada's Prime Minister, apologized on behalf of the Canadian Government for its role in the Indian Residential School System in front of Aboriginal Leaders, elders, and more than 1000 outside the Parliament Building. Harper proclaimed, ""The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history. Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country."" This apology was seen at more than 30 event around the country, and broadcast live on CBC Newsworld and CTV Newsnet. The residential school system was created based on the Gradual Civilization Act (1857) and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act (1869), which assumed the superiority of British Ways, prompting the need for Aboriginals to become ""civilized"" by becoming English-speakers, Christians, and farmers. The funding of the schools was provided by the Indian Act (1876) and by the federal government department, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, and operated with the support of churches, generally the Roman Catholic Church and the United Church of Canada. In the 1920s, attendance became compulsory for all children aged 6 to 15, and families who refused to cooperate were at risk of having the children removed by the government, and the parents sent to prison. The school systematically tried to destroy the aboriginal language and way of life, raising the idea of cultural genocide. Students were forbidden to speak their native languages, even outside the classroom, as to install the English or French language (and as result, to ""forget"" their native language), punishable by unreasonably severe corporal punishment. Practicing non-Christian faiths was also punishable by corporal punishment. In the late 1990s, allegations of sexual abuse, as well as several physical and psychological abuse, arose, leading to large monetary payments from the federal government and churches to former students. The government also established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, providing $350 million to fund community-based healing projects, and provided another $40 million in 2005. On February 13, 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a similar apology in the Australian House of Parliament. On June 21, 2008, Indian Residential School Museum of Canada is scheduled to open on Long Plain First Nation, near Portage La Prairie, Manitoba."

politics,"At least 26,000 United Nations (UN) troops will be sent to the Darfur region of Sudan in Africa under resolution 1769 in an attempt to stop violence from spreading and to protect civilians from the fighting. The force includes at least 19,555 troops and nearly 7,000 civilian police officers in a force being called the ""United Nations-African Union Mission"" (UNAMID). The UN Security Council voted unanimously to send troops to the region. At least 200,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in the region and more than two million have been displaced. Troops will be sent to the region under Chapter 7 of the UN charter which states that the UN ""shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security."" Language authorizing the troops to seize illegal weapons caches and mentions of possible future sanctions if Sudan does not co-operate was removed during negotiations. The resolution does allow troops to monitor weapon caches. ""If any party blocks progress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions. The plan for Darfur from now on is to achieve a cease-fire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive forward peace talks ... and, as peace is established, offer to begin to invest in recovery and reconstruction,"" said the new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Tuesday while visiting the UN headquarters in New York. Troops are expected to be in the region no later than December of this year but may take up to a year to fully deploy. This will be the largest peacekeeping force ever deployed and cost over US$2 billion per year to keep the force in the region. The resolution does not allow for more than 26,000 troops to be deployed."
politics,"Thailand Following the ousting of Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from power, those seeking to peacefully protest the imposition of a military junta in the country on May 22 have adopted a gesture found in The Hunger Games book and film series, curling the little finger and thumb into the palm and raising the three middle fingers in the air. Use of the gesture as a form of protest began last weekend in Bangkok, the capital of the country. This form of protest has drawn the attention of Thailand's military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order, who announced its intent on Tuesday to arrest protestors who display the gesture, in violation of orders to stop. Speaking on behalf of the junta, Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak said to the Associated Press, ""At this point we are monitoring the movement. If it is an obvious form of resistance, then we have to control it so it doesn't cause any disorder in the country."" In a comment to the Bangkok Post, Thai army Colonel Winthai Suwaree shared a similar sentiment: ""The junta must look at the protester's intention, what they want to communicate and surrounding circumstances"". Following the ousting of Thailand's elected government in reportedly the fourteenth coup experienced by the country since the adoption of constitutional monarchy in 1932, the country remains affected by a curfew spanning midnight to 4am, with only Phuket, Koh Samui and Pattaya exempted, as they are beach resorts frequented by tourists, a group for whom the junta made the move in a bid to avoid adverse effects to the country's tourist industry. Nonetheless, in the wake of the coup, the United States Department of State (DoS) advised ""U.S. citizens reconsider any non-essential travel to Thailand, particularly Bangkok"". The DoS also informed US citizens to stay away from groups of protestors, citing that ""even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence."" Other restrictions placed on citizens by the junta include internet censorship and restrictions on television broadcasts. Also banned were assemblies of five or more people with political intent. Solitary displays of the gesture was among a few forms of protest utilized by the Thai people in Bangkok on Sunday, amid the placement of almost 6000 soldiers and police officers by the junta in an effort to suppress protests. Other displays of defiance included protestors banding together in flash mobs or peacefully walking through the central shopping district donning masks in an attempt to bypass security forces stationed there. The gesture finds its origins in The Hunger Games series, where it was a sign of thanks, admiration, and farewell to a loved one, later gaining significance, in the second book Catching Fire, as a symbol of rebellion against the totalitarian government of Panem. Protesters, however, have found their own ways of deriving meaning behind the gesture, with some reportedly interpreting it as standing for liberté, égalité, fraternité, values popularized by the French Revolution. A purported alternative interpretation by protesters held the gesture stood for freedom, election, and democracy. Still others have created a photo montage of the gesture with a picture from the source movie, which circulated online, with the caption ""1. No Coup, 2. Liberty, 3. Democracy"" written on the three extended fingers. Manik Sethisuwan has taken to Twitter with this message: ""Dear #HungerGames. We've taken your sign as our own. Our struggle is non-fiction. Thanks."" Sombat Boonngam-anong, a social activist who has made efforts to rally the Thai people in continued protest, offered his own interpretation of the gesture on Facebook. ""Raising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights"". Sombat belongs to the ""Red Shirts"", a protest group which has supported Shinawatra's government and the earlier government of Thaksin Shinawatra, her brother, and conducted protests amid prosecution by the junta. Sombat advocated a form of silent protest, raising of their right arms, ""3 fingers, 3 times a day"" for 30 seconds at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., in public locations where police officers and the military are absent. ""Let's escalate the anti-coup movement three times a day together,"" said Sombat. Weerachon expressed awareness of the gesture's origins, stating ""We know it comes from the movie, and let's say it represents resistance against the authorities. ... If a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her. But if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action. If it persists, then we will have to make an arrest."" On Sunday, protestors were reportedly detained for that reason. The decision to criminalize displays of the gesture have drawn the criticism of Human Rights Watch, stating it expresses ""a mindset that views human rights with disdain, and sees youthful defiance as the enemy."" Human Rights Watch's Asia director, Brad Adams, remarked: ""The Thai military's assault on basic human rights has apparently grown to not only target peaceful protesters but now also silent ones as well — since now just holding up an arm with a three-finger salute is enough to earn the junta's ire"". The National Council for Peace and Order has stated it imposed military rule over the country due to political deadlock resulting from demonstrations spanning seven months, which occasionally erupted into violence. Last year, on the volatile political situation in Thailand, scholar Nicholas Farrelly wrote in the Australian Journal of International Affairs: ""Each year, Thailand tends to experience at least one period of frenzied coup speculation. Coups clearly still play a major role in Thai mainstream politics."""
politics,"The United States Senate has defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. The bill was defeated 48 to 49 and did not receive the minimum amount of 60 votes to that would allow the bill to be taken to the full Senate. The bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval. In order for the bill to become part of the U.S. Constitution, this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths (that is, 38) of the States. However, Senator David Vitter, R-LA, who is a supporter of the bill says, ""we're building votes."" ""Most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples,"" said John McCain (R-AZ) who opposed the bill. ""A vote for it is a vote against civil unions, against domestic partnership, against all other efforts for states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law,"" said Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy. The bill would define marriage as between a man and a woman, and would preclude the official recognizing of same-sex marriages. The bill is expected to be taken back to the Senate in July. Already, 45 states have banned gay marriages."
politics,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is reporting that thousands of Rwandan asylum seekers who fled to neighbouring Burundi over the last few months have been forced to return home. Trucks laden with people have been seen leaving the camp, and some people have broken limbs after allegedly jumping to avoid returning to Rwanda. According to a press release, the UNHCR was denied access to the Songore transit centre in northern Burundi, making verification difficult. The camp was home to at least 6,000 asylum seekers until last week. The Rwandan and Burundian governments met over the weekend and declared in a joint press release that the asylum seekers were not refugees but ""illegal immigrants"". ""Nothing justifies the presence of these people in Burundi. Rwanda is in peace and there is no persecution,"" said Burundian Interior Minister Jean Marie Ngendahayo. This claim has been criticised by the UNHCR, which has stated that it would be illegal to return the people without first assessing their claim to asylum. Amnesty International has also claimed that Burundi's actions are contrary to international law. ""The use of verbal or physical threats to induce people to return to countries where they fear persecution is in complete contravention of international law &amp;mdash; in particular the binding principle of non-refoulement,"" said Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of Amnesty International's Africa Programme. ""We urge the government of Burundi to implement fair and transparent asylum procedures to establish the risks of return for every single person claiming asylum &amp;mdash; as is their duty under international law,"" he added. This action appears to be part of a wider crackdown on asylum seekers from Rwanda and Burundi. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international aid group, reported yesterday that their medical staff had been denied access to the Songore camp. The Rwandan asylum seekers began arriving in Burundi in March. Their main concern was the Gacaca courts, village courts established to expedite prosecution of perpretators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The UNHCR is also reporting that some asylum seekers ""... said they were fleeing threats, intimidation, persecution and rumours of revenge and bloodshed."" The President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, has previously called for the asylum seekers to return home, stating that they will not be in danger. ""Gacaca is not intended to have all the people who appear at Gacaca arrested and put in prison. We want these people to show remorse and through that they will provide information and will allow people to forgive them and allow them to settle,"" he said. A Wikinews reporter was in Butare recently talking to the locals. She says that the mood is generally supportive of the courts. ""People here believe in the Gacaca process. They say that people have fled now because the investigations are reaching their end and people now know that the are going to be exposed in the process. They have heard 'rumours' that may have been circulated by former leaders of the genocide &amp;mdash; or there may not have been rumours they may merely fear the trials - that there will be reprisals and violence,"" she said. Some people fear reprisals after testifying before the courts. ""Fear is also experienced by those facing testimonies at the Gacaca trial: the widows etc. who will testify against their neighbours. I have been told by several people that high levels of security have been put into place in villages to protect people from revenge attacks for testifying or for being involved,"" she added. There are 8,000 Rwandan asylum seekers in Burundi, and nearly 7,000 Burundians in Rwanda, according to the UNHCR. Original reporting"
politics,"North Korean and South Korean border guards exchanged fire yesterday across the border, the first such incident in about a year. The exchange occurred on July 31, 2006 at sundown, when, according to a claim from Major Kim-Tae-hoon of South Korea, North Korean soldiers fired two shots at a South Korean guard post in the eastern Korean de-militarised zone. Major Kim Tae-hoon also said that South Koreans returned six rounds of fire. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the North) and the Republic of Korea (the South) have been at war since 1950, the beginning of the Korean War, which had no peace treaty which was signed by the two parties. The United Nations Military Armistice Commission, which supervises the armistice that stopped major hostilities during the Korean War, will investigate the event and ask the North Koreans for an explanation."
politics,"Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum. The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality; Savage's readers voted to define santorum as: ""the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."" The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn, New York, and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg. Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail, ""When he was winning in the polls, I thought, 'OK, I'll do a Santorum'."" Regarding how long the beverage will be made available, Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper, ""We'll keep it around until he’s irrelevant. I hope he’s there the whole way"". The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety, Baileys Irish Cream, and Angostura bitters. It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes. The beverage is priced at US$8.00, and upon an order for it, the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism. Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar. After tasting the beverage, Patterson observed, ""My Santorum was sweet but balanced, with a subtle citrus pucker"". 4=Rick Santorum In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press, Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality. Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator’s last name, and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon. The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google's response: ""To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle. I suspect that's not true."" Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview, saying, ""It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it."" Wikinews What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism? John Rauschenberg: Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season, and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of ""santorum."" WN How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column? JR: We don't really remember. It's been around forever. Probably read about it somewhere. WN What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum’s views on gay rights? JR: It's not for us to take a stand on any political issues. We'll leave that to the professionals. WN Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column? JR: We thought it was funny. Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide. WN When was the Santorum cocktail first created? JR: A few months ago. WN What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail? JR: Bailey's, orange vodka, bitters, and chocolate flakes. WN How is the Santorum drink made? JR: The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass. See the pictures. WN Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including: The Brooklyn Paper, The New York Times, Jezebel, Metro.us, EDGE on the Net, and Instinct Magazine. Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage? JR: Not at all. We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy. WN What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail? JR: You'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time, so something sweet: ice cream or pie. WN Is the drink popular? How many times do you suppose you’ve served it at your establishment since its creation? JR: The drink was mildly popular for the last few months, but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity. We have no way to estimate how many times we've served it overall, but we're now pouring around ten a night. WN What are some reactions of your patrons after seeing the availability of Santorum as a cocktail? JR: Most people find it amusing. Some people want to demonstrate their bravery and ability to overcome their mental blocks by drinking one. A lot of people think it's a really appealing mix of ingredients. WN Has anyone come into your facility specifically because they have heard they can order the Santorum cocktail and wish to try it? JR: Yes, especially recently. WN Has the availability of the Santorum cocktail at your pub prompted any interesting political discussions amongst your staff and customers? JR: Nothing more serious than the usual light political banter. Given our location and clientele, most of our customers are of a similar mind politically and there isn't much disagreement. WN How long do you plan on making the Santorum cocktail available at your bar? JR: As long as Santorum stays relevant in the news and customers are interested in ordering it. WN Have you heard any feedback from Rick Santorum or the Santorum campaign about the Santorum cocktail? JR: No. WN Were you at all worried about legal repercussions from creating a cocktail inspired by the santorum neologism? JR: Not at all. There's nothing legally wrong with it. WN Have you created any other drinks named after politicians? JR: No. WN What are your thoughts about the satirical definition for the neologism ""romney"" (""to defecate in terror"") created by Jack Shepler inspired by an incident involving Mitt Romney’s family dog? JR: We don't really have any. WN Do you think you might create a new cocktail based on this ""romney"" neologism? JR: Not based on that definition. If we ever came up with a ""romney"" cocktail it'd probably be something different. Maybe something incredibly bland. WN Comedy hosts Jon Stewart of The Daily Show and Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report have each reported on the santorum neologism repeatedly on their satirical news programs. If asked to do so, would you be willing to appear on these programs to mix up a special Santorum cocktail for the host? JR: Absolutely.

politics,"Crime and law On Tuesday, Pakistan's parliament passed a bill at Islamabad's National Assembly which granted transgender people various civil rights. The bill, ""Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act"", which was presented by Pakistan Peoples Party's lawmaker Naveed Qamar, was approved by the senate in March, and now awaits signature of the president Mamnoon Hussain. The bill ensures people have the right to identify themselves as male, female or as ""third gender"", also known as khawaja sira in Pakistan. This identity choice is to be reflected in the National Database and Registration Authority, as well as other official documents like passports and driving licence. Per the bill, transgender people can now cast votes, run for election, have the right to assemble, and can obtain loans for business startups. They are also eligible to inherit property per their identified gender. Transgender people are to be no longer discriminated at school, working place, for medical services, public transportation facilities, by their employers, or at private business. Separate confinement areas, jails and prisons are to be established for transgenders. Anyone found guilty of forcing transgenders to beg is to face a six-month prison term as well as 50 thousand rupees fine. The legislation was sent to and later approved by the Council of Islamic Ideology, a government advisory body. Lahore-based activist Mehlab Jameel, who was involved in writing the bill, said the Council of Islamic Ideology ""appreciated that the bill included directions on inheritance in accordance with Shari'a"" law. Last year, transgenders were included for the census count for the first time. Mehlab Jameel said, ""the definition of 'transgender' ... was basically based on genitals"" in the initial draft of the bill, written last year. Speaking to National Public Radio, Jameel said, ""This kind of development is not only unprecedented in Pakistani history, but it's one of the most progressive laws in the whole world."" Human Rights Watch has reported at least four deaths of transgenders in the country since the beginning of 2018, and at least 57 transgenders were killed in Pakistan since 2015. Pakistan's &amp;mdash;reportedly&amp;mdash; first transgender news anchor and activist Marvia Malik told Images the transgenders ""are forced to dance and beg because they have no other means to make ends meet."" ""My trans friends who have masters degrees don't have jobs which is why they end up on streets or become sex workers"", Malik added. The draft for the policy to implement this bill is not yet prepared. From the date the bill was approved, President Hussain has ten days to sign the bill or reject it."
politics,"The Afghanistan government and the U.S. Army have begun investigations into whether American soldiers burned the bodies of two suspected Taliban fighters and used the burned bodies to taunt enemy forces. The video reportedly showing U.S. soldiers burning the bodies of suspected Taliban fighters outside the southern village of Gonbaz was shown on Australia's SBS television network. The video was taken by Stephen Dupont, who said the burnings happened October 1 while he was embedded with the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade. Dupont said the incendiary messages later broadcast by the U.S. Army psychological operations unit showed they were aware that the cremation would be seen as desecration. In a televised interview, Dupont told the Australian news agency that: ""They soldiers used that as a psychological warfare, I guess you'd call it. They used the fact that the Taliban were burned facing west toward Mecca. They deliberately wanted to incite that much anger from the Taliban so the Taliban could attack them. ... That's the only way they can find them."" The SBS report suggested the actions could violate the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of enemy remains during wartime which state; ""dead are honorably interred, if possible according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged."" The Taliban government, that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when U.S. led force invaded the country and ended their regime, did not recognize the Geneva Convention in their term of rule. ""We strongly condemn any disrespect to human bodies regardless of whether they are those of enemies or friends,"" said a Afghanistan spokesman Karim Rahimi. ""This alleged action is repugnant to our common values,"" U.S. Maj. Gen. Jason Kamiya said, ""This command takes all allegations of misconduct or inappropriate behavior seriously and has directed an investigation into circumstances surrounding this allegation."""
politics,"United NationsAfter two days of debate, the United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly endorsed a report from the Human Rights Council calling for domestic investigations into alleged war crimes committed by both Israel's military and Palestinian armed forces during the Gaza conflict that began last December. The controversial report concluded that Israel used disproportionate force in the war, deliberately targeted Gaza civilians, used them as human shields, and destroyed civilian infrastructure. One of the 31 chapters of the report discussed crimes by Hamas for firing rockets into Israeli towns. The final vote was 114 in favor, 18 against and 44 abstentions. Strong support came from the Arab and non-aligned countries, many of whom co-sponsored the draft resolution. Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour welcomed the vote, saying the implementation of Justice Richard Goldstone's report will now begin in stages. Ali Treki, the General Assembly president, called the vote ""an important declaration against impunity. It is a call for justice and accountability"". Without justice, there can be no progress towards peace. A human being should be treated as a human being, regardless of his or her religion, race or nationality,"" he said. ""In three months we will come back to General Assembly to consider the report of the Secretary-General for further action, including in all parts of the United Nations, including in the Security Council,"" said Riyad Mansour, a Palestinian-American diplomat. The non-binding resolution requests the secretary-general report to the General Assembly within three months on the implementation of the resolution, with a view to considering further action, if necessary. Israel's deputy ambassador to the UN, Daniel Cameron said that the resolution, ""endorses and legitimizes a deeply flawed, one-sided and prejudiced report of the discredited Human Rights Council and its politicised work that bends both fact and law"". source=Riyad Mansour, Palestinian-American diplomatOf the countries abstaining or voting no, several said that although they agreed with the essence of the resolution - that the parties should conduct their own independent, credible investigations into alleged violations as called for in the Goldstone report - they could not vote in favor because they had difficulty with two specific items in the resolution. Another point of some contention is that the resolution leaves the door open for future action in the UN Security Council. The Palestinians have made clear they plan to pursue that option, but most of the council's five permanent members opposed the idea, saying the right forum for the Goldstone report is in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where it started. The United States was the only permanent Security Council member to vote against the resolution. Deputy Ambassador Alejandro Wolff said that although it opposed the resolution, the US strongly supported accountability for human rights and humanitarian law violations relating to the Gaza conflict. ""We believe that the Goldstone report is deeply flawed-including its unbalanced focus on Israel, its sweeping conclusions of law, the excessively negative inferences it draws about Israel's intentions and actions, its failure to deal adequately with the asymmetrical nature of the Gaza conflict, its failure to assign appropriate responsibility to Hamas for its decision to base itself and its operations in heavily civilian-populated urban areas, and its many overreaching recommendations,"" said Alejandro Wolff. What is your opinion on the report? Do you agree with it?Israel, which did not cooperate with the Goldstone commission, voted against the resolution, saying that it legitimised a ""deeply flawed, one-sided"" report, and disregarded Israel's right to defend its citizens. ""The results of the vote and the large number of member states who voted against or abstained, demonstrate clearly that the resolution does not have the support of the 'moral majority' of UN members,"" read a statement on the website of Israel's ministry of foreign affairs. ""Israel rejects the resolution of the UN General Assembly, which is completely detached from realities on the ground."" During the three-week-long Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip, at least 1,400 Palestinians died according to Palestinians and human rights groups, although Israel says 1,166, and 13 Israelis also died. The Goldstone Commission criticized both sides for violations of international humanitarian law."

politics,"Brian Smithson After meeting Sunday with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Chadian President Idriss Déby opened the door to the possible deployment of United Nations (UN) or European Union (EU) troops to Chad's volatile eastern region. Yesterday, Kouchner met with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. Until Sunday, Chad had rejected the idea of allowing military troops in to assist with security at its border with Sudan. In Chad's eastern region, the government has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims has been supported by Sudan. While dealing with the insurgency, Chad had been amenable to an international police presence, but not a military force. An estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees have fled the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan and crossed the border into Chad. In addition, Chad is coping with an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons. The conditions in the camps set up to deal with the refugees have been criticised as inadequate by the aid group, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). France's newly appointed foreign minister, and co-founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner, and Chad's President Déby were able to work out some concessions on the use of foreign troops. Following the meeting, Déby was asked by reporters whether he would allow UN or EU military troops to take a role in security and stabilization measures for a humanitarian mission. ""Why not,"" Déby replied. Déby revealed that plans for an international force for Chad would be made public by the end of June. ""We are agreed on the principle of deploying a force, but there are still some points to resolve, on which we must agree,"" said Déby. ""The results of the discussions will be made public before the 25th of this month."" ""We have been proposing this to the international community since 2004,"" said Déby. But Chad's Prime Minister, Delwa Kassiré Koumakoye, commented recently that neighbouring countries may take the use of foreign troops as a threat. On June 9, MSF issued a press release warning of a humanitarian crisis developing in Chad. ""It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid,"" said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad. Photographic Dept. of the Prime Minister Following his visit to Chad, Foreign Minister Kouchner traveled to Sudan where he met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has, in the past, rejected the deployment of an international force, and has resisted the use of a UN-African Union (AU) force. During their meeting Monday, al-Bashir told Kouchner that he would only accept troops from Africa. Kouchner indicated that his meetings with al-Bashir and other officials had been productive and would ""lift a certain number of complications"" in obtaining agreements with Sudan. He and al-Bashir also discussed the unilateral sanctions imposed on Sudan by the United States. Kouchner felt that the sanctions haven't been useful and that the Sudanese ""seem clearly affected by this issue, considering how much they raised it."" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed some optimism on the issue of troop deployment and acknowledged he received a letter recently from al-Bashir on the matter. As stated in the letter, al-Bashir has accepted in principal the idea of a UN-AU force of 23,000 troops to be stationed in Darfur. ""I sincerely hope that we will be able to have early resolution of this issue,"" said Ban. One roadblock may be al-Bashir's refusal to accept any force other than African. The UN and AU stated they would attempt to use only African troops, but indicated that non-African troops may be used if that were not possible. ""Darfur cannot be only an African problem,"" said Kouchner. ""At a certain level, the respect for human rights concerns the whole world."""

politics,"United Nations The United Nations Security Council has passed Resolution 1929 imposing a fourth round of sanctions against Iran over its alleged nuclear program. The Security Council voted 13 to 2 to impose new sanctions on Iran unless it reveals more details of its nuclear programme. Brazil and Turkey voted against the resolution, while Lebanon abstained. The sanctions do not include major blockades, but do include measures against Iranian banks abroad, a cargo inspection regime, and provisions that all countries shall prevent the supply, sale or transfer to Iran of battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles, or missile systems. President Obama praised the Security Council vote and said, ""This resolution will put in place the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government, and it sends an unmistakable message about the international community’s commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons"". Brazil and Turkey criticised the sanctions, saying they could undermine further diplomatic efforts. They had previously offered to mediate the dispute, an offer which was accepted by Iran. Iran recently reached a deal with them to ship most of its enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for low-level nuclear fuel to run a medical reactor. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva: ""Sadly, this time it was Iran who wanted to negotiate, and those who didn’t want to negotiate were those who think that force resolves everything. I think that taking this decision was a mistake. I think the Security Council threw out a historic opportunity to negotiate calmly on Iran’s nuclear program and also to discuss in a deeper way the deactivation in countries with nuclear bombs."" Iran responded to the UN vote by threatening to reduce its ties to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to continue its uranium enrichment program. Iran’s ambassador to the the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said ""No matter how many resolutions are passed, Islamic Republic of Iran will not stop its enrichment activities, which is in full accordance with its right under the statute of IAEA and Non-Proliferation Treaty""."
politics,"Superior Court Judge Richard A. Kramer struck down two California laws that limited marriage in the state to a union of opposite-sex couples. The ruling came one year after San Francisco made worldwide headlines when it opened its city hall to same-sex weddings over Valentine's Day weekend through March 11 2004. Kramer said the two California laws violated the state's constitutional guarantees of privacy and a legal concept called due process - which tries to ensure each person is treated equally by the law. ""The denial of marriage to same-sex couples appears impermissibly arbitrary,"" Kramer wrote in the opinion released Monday. In his decision, Kramer cited United States Supreme Court case law ranging from Brown v. Board of Education to Lawrence v. Texas in a step-by-step dismantling of legal arguments against same-sex marriage. Including the following excerpts: *Traditional definition of marriage: ""Same-sex marriage cannot be prohibited solely because California has always done so before."" *With California's domestic partner laws, gays don't need marriage: ""That California has granted marriage-like rights to same-sex couples points to the conclusion that there is no rational state interest in denying them the rites of marriage as well."" *The purpose of marriage is procreation: ""The obvious natural and social reality is that one does not have to be married to procreate, nor does one have to procreate in order to be married."" Kramer, a Catholic Republican Judge appointed by Pete Wilson, California's previous conservative governor, issued a ""stay"" on his order, making it a tentative decision by delaying its implementation for 60 days to allow the same-sex marriage opponents time to file an appeal to his ruling. The case is widely expected to be brought before the California Supreme Court. Less than a year ago, the state's Supreme Court annulled more than 4,000 same-sex marriages which took place in San Francisco County in 2004. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, but ruled more narrowly that San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom overstepped his authority by unilaterally deciding not to follow state laws he did not agree with instead of challenging the laws in court, which is the proper legal way to overturn or affirm laws in California and much of the United States."
politics,"Politics and conflicts A car bomb was used in an attack on the Indian embassy in central Kabul, Afghanistan on Monday morning. The bombing killed 41, and injured at least 141. It is the deadliest attack in Kabul since 2001, when Afghanistan's Taliban government was ousted by American armed forces. The attack happened at the gates of the embassy, located in central Kabul, near many other government buildings including the office of the Interior Ministry of Afghanistan. A security office and part of a wall were destroyed, and the blast was large enough to spread debris to surrounding buildings. Ali Hassan Fahimi, whose office is nearby, said shrapnel landed in his office. ""It was so strong... our staff were shocked,"" he commented. Many of the victims were Afghans who were lining up for visas to travel to India. Of the casualties, most were civilians. The dead include embassy workers, a defense attache, a senior counselor, two security guards, an Afghan employee and six police officers. The foreign ministry of Afghanistan said that they ""condemn today's terrorist attack on the embassy of the friendly and brother country of India."" An Afghan government spokesman, Zamari Bashari, suggested that the attack was retaliation for India's support for reconstruction in Afghanistan. India called the bombing a ""cowardly terrorist attack"" and said that they would send a delegation to investigate. Foreign entities voiced similar sentiments. The United Nations envoy Kai Eide said, ""I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. In no culture, no country, and no religion is there any excuse or justification for such acts. The total disregard for innocent lives is staggering and those behind this must be held responsible."" The European Union condemned the attack as a ""terrorist attack targeting innocent civilians"" and the United States said it was a ""needless act of violence"". The foreign minister of Pakistan, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, denounced the attack, saying, ""Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as this menace negates the very essence of human values."""
politics,"Turkey The Turkish government removed its block of YouTube on Tuesday following a ruling by Turkey's Constitutional Court found the ban violated freedom of speech. The popular video sharing website was banned along with social media platform Twitter after leakage though the services in March of audio recordings of government meetings. The Turkish telecommunications regulator called it a ""precautionary administrative measure"". The recordings, whose release Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called treasonous, presented military discussions of Turkish intervention in Syria. Other leaked recordings presented alleged corruption among close associates of Mr Erdogan. Twitter was unblocked in April but lower court rulings against the YouTube block were not acted on. Turkey had also blocked access to YouTube from 2007 to 2010."
politics,"New York On Wednesday, the New York State Assembly passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, with a vote of 80 in favor of the bill to 63 against. This is the third time a resolution legalizing same-sex marriage passed the Assembly in recent years. The bill must next be approved by the Senate. If it becomes a law, New York would become the sixth United States state where same-sex marriage is legal, joining Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington D.C., and Iowa. It was briefly legal in California, but was rescinded by the voters in 2008 by a measure called Proposition 8. Assemblyman Charles Lavine said he thought America's Founding Fathers ""have smiles on their faces,"" in light of the bill's passage. Same-sex marriage opponent Assemblyman Dov Hikind said God knows gay marriage is wrong. As of Wednesday the measure appeared to be one vote short of passage in the Senate. Governor Cuomo, who has been a strong supporter of the bill, has said in the past he would not introduce the bill unless he believed it would pass. On Tuesday he introduced the bill, in both the Assembly and the Senate. Opponents of the bill in the Senate are considering whether to allow it to come to a Senate vote. Two Republicans in the Senate have said they would support the bill if it came to a vote. Republican Majority Leader of the Senate Dean Skelos has said if it were brought to a vote, ""If they favor it, I’ve always said, they can vote for it."""
politics,"Following elections in the country of Kuwait on June 2, two women were appointed for the first time ever to the Kuwaiti municipal council. This follows a historic decision on May 16 that granted Kuwaiti women the right to vote and run for public office in future elections. The Kuwaiti Minster of Social Affairs, Faysal al-Hajji, said that ""During its weekly meeting on Sunday, the cabinet named two women to the municipal council for the first time in the history of Kuwait."" The women are: * Sheikha Fatima al-Sabah, architect and member of the Al-Sabah ruling family * Fawziya al-Bahar, engineer. The positive developments in Kuwaiti politics have been praised by many feminists and foreign observers. The decision to grant women the vote overcame strong resistance to pass by a 35-23 margin. The only remaining Middle Eastern country that does not grant women the right to vote is Saudi Arabia. The sixteen members of the council are divided between ten members who are elected by popular vote, and six who are appointed. The ten elected members were all male and mostly conservative. The six appointees were the two women and four men considered to be liberals. The election and appointment results still need to be ratified by the Emir, who has been supportive of the efforts to give women the right to vote. Although women were not eligible to run for elective office during the most recent election, they are expected to vote and run for office in Kuwait for the first time ever beginning in the 2007 parliamentary elections."
politics,"The government of Iran has banned the human rights group Defenders of Human Rights Center led by Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi. On Saturday, the Iranian newspaper Shargh reported an Interior Ministry statement announcing the ban, ""As the group calling itself 'Defenders of Human Rights Center' has not obtained a permit from the interior ministry, its activities are illegal and the violators of this decision will be prosecuted,"". Ebadi told reporters that such a permit was not required, ""Non-governmental organizations that observe the law and do not disrupt public safety do not need a permit. So the... Center does not need authorization"". She said that the group had applied for the permit but the Interior Ministry denied the request without any explanation. Saying that the ""move is not in Iran's national interest"", Ebadi said that the group will protest against the decision and explore legal options to ""obtain our rights"". The group was started by six prominent lawyers and has campaigned on human and minority rights issues for the past four years. It has criticized Iran's judiciary for violations of human rights. Abdolfattah Soltani, a member of the group was sentenced last month to five years in jail on charges of disclosing confidential information and opposing the regime. He had represented the imprisoned journalist Akbar Ganji as well as the family of the Iranian-Canadian photographer Zahra Kazemi, who was killed in custody in 2003. The group demanded an independent probe into the death of dissident student activist Akbar Mohammadi, who died in prison on Sunday following a hunger strike. The ban comes on the 100th anniversary of Iran's ""constitutional revolution"" of August 5, 1906, when the monarch of what was then Persia decreed the creation of a constitution and an elected parliament - the Majlis. ""The ban has a bad meaning for the country"" on such a day, said Mohammad Dadkhah, a founder of the rights group. Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, for ""her efforts for democracy and human rights...especially on the struggle for the rights of women and children,"". She was the first Iranian and first Muslim woman to receive the honour."
politics,"The Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, warned the United States against any attack on his country saying ""The Americans should know that if they launch an assault against Islamic Iran, their interests in every possible part of the world will be harmed."" Earlier this week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran was ready to begin offering nuclear technology to developing countries. Speaking at a rally in North-West Iran this Thursday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying ""Those who want to prevent Iranians from obtaining their right, should know that we do not give a damn about such resolutions."" Iran says that its nuclear program is meant for producing energy and that it has a right under Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to enrich fuel for that purpose. The President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated,""Iran won't back down one iota"". The US has called on Iran to stop its enrichment work and accuses Iran of trying to build a nuclear bomb. The US ""is leaving all options on the table"" not excluding military strikes with nuclear weapons or with conventional weapons in the eventuality of sanctions being ineffective. Iranian leaders have made strong statements against possible sanctions or military action against their country. The Ayatollah Khamenei said, ""The Iranian nation will give a double response to any strike."" Tehran has vowed to respond against US targets worldwide in the case of a US led attack against Iran. According to some claims, the US has already started attacking Iran. On April 18, Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) wrote a letter to George W. Bush requesting information about claims that the US has already sent US covert operatives and/or retrained ex-members of MEK and the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK, associated with the PKK) into Iranian territory in order to provoke existing ethnic tensions by incidents of violence. MEK and PKK are classified by the U.S. State Department and by the Council of the European Union as terrorist organizations. The UN Security Council has called on Iran to suspend its enrichment work by Friday and permit additional inspections of its nuclear programme. Iran has rejected the demands. The IAEA is scheduled to report on Iran's compliance of the Security Council resolution on Friday. A 90 minute meeting between Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the president of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA provided no breakthrough and no new proposals were made, although Aghazadeh's deputy Mohammed Saidi said the talks were ""encouraging."" Speaking Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke in Vienna at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers over Iran's nuclear program. ""The United States believes ... that in order to be credible the Security Council of course has to act,"" to reporters. Condoleezza Rice also said that it was ""highly unlikely"" Tehran would comply with the US's demands and that the UN ""cannot have its word and its will simply ignored by a member state."" Further, Rice stated that ""I look forward to discussing this with my colleagues and to I and others making that case, and I would certainly hope the Security Council is prepared to take some action."" The German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, ""We expect Iran to meet international standards and ... to allay world suspicions that its civil nuclear operations are being used to develop a possible weapons program."" Russia and China have called for negotiations to resolve the issue with President Vladimir Putin saying that the IAEA must retain the lead in the process. Widespread resentment of western influence on past Iranian internal affairs, such as Operation Ajax which removed the democratically elected prime minister of Iran in 1953, has called some experts to bring into question the possibility of a coalition of NATO or U.S. led forces against Iran. The likelihood of any preventive strike against Iran is uncertain, apart from the claims that US troops and or proxy troops have already started small scale attacks. With a large young population increasingly pro-western, there are fears that any strike against Iran could damage any democratic movement as the population as a whole resents pro-Western influence in its internal affairs. Iran has nearly four times the land area of Iraq. Iran's military is estimated to 768,000/350,000 active/reserve military troops and the paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps include 11,000,000 troops."
politics,"Palestine On Monday, the Palestinian National Authority (PA) was granted the status of an Observer State in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. This decision promotes the PA toward permanent membership in the court, and helps establish the PA's status in the international arena. The ICC is an independent organization, in which 122 states are members. The organization operates under the Rome Statute, and is not part of the United Nations (UN) as such. The observer status is a further promotion in the international community's approach toward the PA. Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said that now, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas needs to decide when to apply to be accepted as a full member. Human Rights Watch international justice counsel Balkees Jarrah told the Associated Press his organization called on the Palestinians ""to join the court which could open up the prospect of justice for serious crimes by all sides"". source=Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch This is another step for the PA toward exercising its threats to sue Israel for committing war crimes in its territory, following the armed conflict between the two sides in Gaza last summer. PA Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said there was ""no other option"" given the large numbers of civilian casualties. This step was taken despite Israel's warnings to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, backed by the US, not to apply for full membership in the ICC. Israelis have objected that move could lead to pressuring Israel during future negotiations, using the threat of a war crimes suit. In November 2012, the Palestinian Authority was accepted as an observing state without the right to vote in the UN, in a sweeping vote of the general assembly. Subsequently, during the last few weeks, several European parliaments voted in favor of acknowledgement of a Palestinian state. Similarly to the vote in Hague last Monday, these votes are symbolic gestures."
politics,"Nigeria Six people have died after a shooting incident Thursday in a Deeper Life church located in Gombe, in the north east of Nigeria. Gombe state police spokesman Ahmed Muhammad reported that eight other individuals had also been wounded during the shootings. The wife of the pastor of the church was amongst those killed in the attack, which happened as a prayer service was in progress. Theresa Munyok, self-identified as daughter and brother of two of those shot dead, spoke of the events which occurred. ""The only thing I heard was my mommy shouting,"" Munyok explained. ""She told me that it was gunshots and that my dad is not even breathing. She called and called and he did not wake up,"" she said. No groups were reported to have claimed responsibility for the incident. It is reportedly suspected that Boko Haram, a Muslim sect, carried out the attack. On Sunday, an individual presumed to be a representative of Boko Haram gave a warning to the Christian citizens of the north of Nigeria, which is mainly Muslim, ordering them to depart from the region within three days. Boko Haram translates from Hausa to English as 'Western education is sacrilege'. The group was reportedly responsible in 2011 for over five hundred killings. The group accepted responsibility for the attack of a Catholic church near the Nigerian capital Abuja on Christmas Day, in which at least 37 people died, as well as a suicide bombing at a United Nations building in the same city, where 25 people were killed as a result. Goodluck Jonathan, the president of Nigeria, placed various areas of the country in a state of emergency on December 31, 2011, including areas in Yobe, Plateau, Borno and Niger state. Gombe was not included amongst these states. Authorities in these areas can now arrest individuals without requiring evidence to do so. Similarly, searches can be made by authorities without requiring warrants to do so."
politics,"US politics With Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts's nomination and likely approval as U.S. President Barack Obama's choice to replace the retiring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Kerry's Senate seat is expected soon to be vacated, making necessary a special election to choose a new Senator. That potential race is now taking shape with two candidates having emerged as the frontrunners for their respective parties' nominations: Republican Senator Scott Brown and Democratic Representative Ed Markey. Massachusetts law adopted in 2004 requires a vacated seat to be filled permanently through special election held 145 to 160 days following vacation. This law was passed purportedly to prevent then-Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, from naming a replacement for Kerry, who was at the time, the Democratic presidential nominee. No such election occurred until long-time Senator Ted Kennedy died in office, vacating his seat in 2009. At the time, Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick named Democrat Paul G. Kirk as a temporary replacement. Kirk chose not to run for the seat, and instead the Democrats nominated Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who lost to Brown. Now, Patrick reportedly wishes to again name a temporary replacement who will not run in the special election. Candidates for this position include: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Ted Kennedy; former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis; and the retiring Congressman Barney Frank. Amid the Senate's consideration of the Affordable Health Care for America Act, Brown's 2010 election broke the Democrats' filibuster-proof super-majority in the chamber. As the first Massachusetts Republican elected since Edward Brooke in 1972, Brown gained a reputation in the Senate as a political moderate, stressing bipartisanship. However, in the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history in 2012, he lost the seat to the liberal Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren, who tied him to conservative Senate Republicans. After the defeat, Republican Senators Dan Coats of Indiana, John McCain of Arizona, and Olympia Snowe of Maine each asked Brown to run for Senate again. He alluded to a potential return during his farewell address earlier in December, noting, ""As I’ve said many times before, victory and defeat is temporary ... Depending on what happens, and where we go, all of us, we may obviously meet again."" Though former Governor William Weld is also considered a potential Republican primary candidate, Brown leads him in opinion polls by a wide margin. Additionally, a December 17&amp;ndash;18 poll conducted by WBUR shows Brown with a 58 percent favorability rate in his state and ahead of potential Democratic nominees Markey, former Congressman Marty Meehan, and Congressmen Mike Capuano and Stephen Lynch. Patrick, Kennedy, Coakley, and Meehan have all denied interest in the seat as have other Democrats speculated to jump in including actor Ben Affleck and attorney Edward M. Kennedy, Jr., Ted Kennedy's son. Though Lynch and Capuano have expressed interest in the seat, Markey is thus far the only announced candidate. In a statement to The Boston Globe, Markey affirmed ""this fight is too important"" not to run and ""there is so much at stake"" in the election. He added that an official announcement would come in January. Markey, who has served in Congress since 1976, previously ran for the Senate seat in 1984 but withdrew before the primary; Kerry went on to win the primary and seat that year. Markey intends to focus his campaign on global warming, gun control, protection of Social Security and Medicare, and government spending for jobs. He has secured endorsements from both Kerry and Victoria Kennedy, and with a war chest of $3.1 million from his congressional campaigns, has significantly more funds than any of his potential primary opponents. According to political scientist Peter Ubertaccio of Stonehill College, that may discourage prominent Democrats thinking about entering the race. Nevertheless, State Senator Benjamin Downing has announced he is exploring a potential bid. Though Markey has more money than Brown's $464,000 left from his 2012 campaign, Ubertaccio, in his analysis of the race, notes Brown has more recent campaign experience than Markey, who has not had a competitive campaign lately. Moreover, he finds Markey ""very much a creature of Washington, which can be problematic in a tough statewide race."" He sees the rush to support Markey as unusual, and as a way to discourage Democratic challengers to Markey. Jon Keller of Boston's CBS affiliate notes the rush was likely to allow Markey to begin attacks on Brown rather than Democrats, but he concludes the lack of choice for Democrats may give Brown an advantage as an outsider running against the insiders' hand-picked successor."
politics,"Today, representatives of 111 countries have adopted a formal ban on cluster bombs. The ban is to be signed and ratified by each country during December 2-3 in Oslo, Norway, the country that initiated the discussions on the ban. Following almost two weeks of negotiations, the ban was agreed upon at a ceremony held in Dublin, Ireland. Signatories will be required to completely get rid of cluster bomb stockpiles within eight years. Cluster bombs are characterized by the small ""bomblets"" that they release while falling. Many are opposed to this type of munition because the ""bomblets"" spread over a large area, meaning that they can easily injure or kill innocent civilians even when aimed at a specific enemy target. Despite U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voicing his hopes that all nations would agree to the ban, many countries have boycotted the ban, including the United States, Russia, Israel, Pakistan and India. Military analyst Marc Garlasco of the organization Human Rights Watch noted that these nations will be less likely to use the munitions due to the stigma that will be attached to them. While widely celebrated, some criticize the pact for not being strong enough in its implications. For example, signatories will still be allowed to cooperate on military operations with non-signatories. The ban will go into effect in mid-2009."
politics,"Voters in California, Florida and Arizona voted on Tuesday to ban gay marriage, bringing about a victory for conservatives on a day which did not bring many conservative wins. Meanwhile, voters in Colorado, South Dakota and California voted on measures which would have restricted abortion in those states. In Massachusetts and Michigan, voters passed measures that loosen marijuana laws. Finally, in the state of Washington a measure was passed that allows physician-assisted suicide. The California ballot measure, Proposition 8, overturns the recent June ruling by the California State Supreme Court in the case In re Marriage Cases which reversed a 1977 statute passed by the California State Legislature and a 2000 ballot measure, Proposition 22, which also banned same-sex marriage by defining marriage as between a man and a woman. The wording of Proposition 8 is identical to Proposition 22. It was noted that many of the African-Americans and Latinos who cast their votes for Obama, also voted for the measure. The measure passed at 52% to 48%. Lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres noted, ""This morning, when it was clear that Proposition 8 had passed in California, I can’t explain the feeling I had. I was saddened beyond belief. Here we just had a giant step toward equality and then on the very next day, we took a giant step away."" 4=Melissa Etheridge Singer Melissa Etheridge, who is also a lesbian, stated that she would no longer pay taxes due to the passing of Proposition 8, announcing in a blog post, ""Okay, so I am taking that to mean I do not have to pay my state taxes because I am not a full citizen."" Also in California, voters rejected a measure which would require parental notification for a minor to receive an abortion. The measure was rejected with the same percentage as Proposition 8, 52% to 48%. Meanwhile in Colorado, voters rejected a measure that would define life as beginning at conception. While the measure did not specifically mention abortion it would have required legislators and courts to confront legal rights for fetuses - effectively preventing abortion. The measure was defeated in a wide margin, 73% to 27% In South Dakota, voters also defeated an anti-abortion measure which would have outlawed abortion in all cases except in the case of rape, incest or if the mother's health was in serious question. If passed, the law would most likely have been challenged as unconstitutional. In Michigan, voters approved a measure which legalizes medical marijuana. Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, voters approved a ballot question that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana in which the possession of an ounce or less would be punishable by a $100 fine. The measure will also require minors under the age 18 to participate in and complete a drug awareness program and do community service. Failure to do so, would net the minor a $1,000 fine. ""Tonight's results represent a sea change. Voters have spectacularly rejected eight years of the most intense government war on marijuana since the days of 'Reefer Madness,'"" said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""The people were ahead of the politicians on this issue; they recognize and want a more sensible approach to our marijuana policy,"" said Whitney Taylor, the chair of Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy, which backed the Massachusetts proposition. Also, in Massachusetts, voters overwhelmingly, in every single Massachusetts city and town, rejected a ballot measure which would have eliminated the state income tax by 2010, the ballot measure was sponsored by the Committee for Small Government, which is headed up by two libertarians, Michael Cloud, a Libertarian Party candidate for U.S. Senate in 2002 and Carla Howell, Libertarian Party candidate for governor in the 2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election. The last time the income tax elimination measure was on the ballot was in 2002, where it was defeated, narrowly by 45.3%. This stunned supporters of the income tax, who mounted a fierce campaign against the measure this time warning Massachusetts residents that repealing the income tax would have drastic effects on the state's finances, leading to cuts in services, education and local aid. Finally, voters passed a question which bans dog racing in Massachusetts, which will lead to the closure of Massachusetts' two greyhound racing tracks, Raynham-Taunton Greyhound Park and Wonderland Greyhound Park. The campaign against dog racing was headed up by the Committee to Protect Dogs and endorsed by GREY2K USA and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals along with other animal protection organizations who claimed that dog racing was inhumane as the dogs were stuffed into cramped cages and endured injuries. The measure was opposed by the park owners including George Carney who owns the Rayham-Taunton park and Charles Sarkis, a restaurateur who owns Wonderland. ""We did it. We did it for the dogs,"" said Carey Thiel, executive director of GREY2K USA. ""For 75 years, greyhounds in our state have endured terrible confinement and suffered serious injuries. We're better than that,"" Thiel added. One campaign supporter, Sandy Bigelow noted, ""It means everything. We've worked so hard for the dogs and they heard us. It feels so good. Oh, God, it feels so good."" George Carney said of the results, ""It's not a very pleasant thing right now. Some of these people have been here 40 years. Here's a company that did nothing wrong, paid their federal taxes on time, paid the town on time. The town is going to be a severe loser, and a lot of people here dedicated their life to the company."" 4=Carey Thiel, GREY2KUSA Both sides used emotionally-charged advertisements, the anti-racing side showing “sad-eyed greyhounds,” while the pro-racing side highlighted the workers who would be out of work when the tracks close. Both measures must now come before the Massachusetts Governor's Council for approval. A ballot initiative approved by voters in the north-western state of Washington will make it the second state to permit physician-assisted suicide. Initiative 1000 follows the ten-year-old example of the Death With Dignity Act of neighboring Oregon, and will allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication for a terminally ill patient to administer themselves. It was approved by a margin of 16%, and the ‘Yes’ campaign outspent the ‘No’ campaign by more than three-to-one. The law comes into effect in 2009."
politics,"Libya The United Kingdom and France have begun helicopter attacks against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in Libya, as part of the NATO campaign to protect civilians. The Apache helicopters were launched from the British ship HMS Ocean and the French assault ship Tonnerre, and attacked a radar installation and a military checkpoint near Brega. Whilst in a separate mission, helicopters destroyed two ammunition bunkers in central Libya. ""The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas,"" NATO said in a statement. ""NATO's operation is being conducted under the United Nations Security Resolution 1973, which calls for an immediate end to all attacks against civilians and authorized all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya."" The Libyan government has been under international pressure to step down after it had been accused of killing civilians indiscriminately with mortars, snipers, and bombings of suspected rebels in areas like Tripoli and Misrata. The government was also accused last month of using Red Cross Helicopters to evade the no-fly zone enforcement to bomb targets in Misrata."
politics,"economy and business China has offered Africa concessional loans worth 6.5 billion as part of a host of new measures aimed at improving the economy of African nations. The announcement was made at the opening of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Leaders of nearly 50 African countries are attending the two-day conference. China had already stated today at the 3rd Conference of Chinese and African Entrepreneurs, held immediately before the FOCAC, that Chinese firms would be encouraged to invest in Africa, while both sides would work together to improve the tourism, telecommunications and finance industries. China also said that governments should work with businesses to ensure co-operation between China and Africa. As well as the loans, made over three years, China will write off the debt of Africa's poorest countries, build 100 African green energy facilities and systematically lower import duties on 95% of all African products exported to China. Another promise is a loan of one billion dollars aimed at small and medium sized businesses in Africa. There will also be efforts to promote each other's culture and increased medical assistance to Africa. Medical assistance comes in the form of 500 million yuan (US$73.2 million) of goods for the 60 hospitals and malaria centers China has already built, as well as 3,000 doctors and nurses. Roads will also be improved. China also plans to assist with satellite weather monitoring, to help combat desertification and work within the urban environment, all aimed at reducing global warming. The new energy facilities will focus on solar, biogas and small-scale hydroelectrical installations. Another new measure is a promise to aid African farmers to ensure the continent is fed, increasing the number of demonstrations of agricultural technology in Africa to 20 and sending 50 teams of agricultural technology experts to the continent. Training in agricultural technology will be provided to 2,000 people. ""The Chinese people cherish sincere friendship toward the African people, and China's support to Africa's development is concrete and real,"" said co-chair Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as the FOCAC opened up, adding ""Whatever change that may take place in the world, our friendship with African people will not change."" He described this friendship as 'unbreakable'. Two years ago China pledged 3.37 billion at the last FOCAC in Beijing and now, according to Jiabao, ""China is ready to deepen practical cooperation in Africa."" source=Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete China has fulfilled its 2006 pledge, investing a total of 5.26 billion in Africa last year alone. 49 African countries are represented at the FOCAC, which was created in 2000, although Jiabao noted that relations between China and Africa go back fifty years. China had already forgiven or reduced the debt for thirty nations at that FOCAC summit. According to Chinese state-owned paper China Daily, trade between China and Africa increased by 45% last year, to give a total value of 72.1 billion, a tenfold increase since 2001 and up from 331 million in 2003. The Chinese have a 9.8% market share, the largest of any nation, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. China has paid for schools, hospitals, malaria clinics and Chinese scholarships for African students. 50 more schools are to be built and 1,500 people trained to staff them. Since 2006 Chinese energy firms have committed to spend at least 10.8 billion securing African oil and gas. China's Sinopec Group, an oil giant, bought up Addax Petroleum Corporation from its Swiss owners that year, gaining control of oilfields in Nigeria, Cameroon and Gabon. China promised earlier this year to spend 6 billion on infrastructure in the Congo in exchange for mineral deposits for mining operations. Jean Ping, leader of the African Union, said the told those at the conference that the money is coming at an opportune time, because African growth was ""totally compromised"" by the global financial crisis. Ping said one of the lessons learned is that the world is paying for ""the irresponsible and lax behavior"" of large financial companies whose philosophy was to make short-term profits. source=Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir Not all Africans are happy with China's increasing involvement in their continent. Trade practices are a concern for some, with a view that China exploits Africa for raw materials before selling back finished goods. Among these are Egyptian Trade and Industry Minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid. Egypt is the richest nation in the Middle East and is discussing this perceived issue with China. Rachid told Bloomberg ""What is a worry for me is if competition is unfair. That is where we are unhappy."" Jiabao described the trade as being based on ""win-win programmes... and transparency."" Others in Africa are delighted with the situation. ""We want more investment from China,"" Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete told the forum. Egypt's own President Hosni Mubarak talked of ""peace, security and growth,"" and of ""boosting cooperation between China and Africa."" China investing in Africa: Good or bad? Jiabao also used his speech to respond to criticisms that China worked with nations regardless of their human rights record, such as Sudan, whose President Omar al-Beahir is wanted on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. ""Africa is fully capable of solving its own problems, in an African way,"" he said, adding that ""China has never attached any political strings … to assistance to Africa."" Beshir thanked China in a speech for diplomatic work in Sudan, including working to defuse the Darfur conflict, which the United Nations says has left 300,000 dead. ""We express our deep appreciation for China's efforts in backing the comprehensive peace agreement in Sudan and its peace efforts in Darfur,"" he said, referring to a peace deal between the northern and southern parts of his country. ""We thank China particularly for backing efforts by our countries to achieve peace and stability in Africa's zones of conflict."" Jiabao said China was willing to work towards ""the settlement of issues of peace and security,"" in Africa. A further criticism has been that China has brought in Chinese workers and used their own knowledge, instead of training locals. Jiabao's speech indicated an intention to co-operate better in the fields of science and technology, as well as improve training for African students on technical courses. ""Why do some only criticise China?"" asked Jiabao. ""Is this a view representing African countries, or rather the view of Western countries?"""
politics,"Iran is referencing the conditions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as justification for defending what it believes is its right under Article IV of the NPT to have nuclear technology and hold on to its developing nuclear program, despite great pressure from the West and others to abandon certain nuclear technological capabilities. Article IV defines ...the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty. The Associated Press reported today that Tehran is planning a retaliation contingency against Israel should the country go forward with a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities in early March, as Ariel Sharon said may occur, before he suffered a debilitating stroke in December 2005. General Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, Iran's minister of defense, articulated Teheran's position on any military action against Iran's nuclear capability, saying that ""Zionists should know that if they do anything evil against Iran, the response of Iran's armed forces will be so firm that it will send them into eternal coma, like (Ariel) Sharon"". He also proceeded to question the resolve of the United States and Israel to attack Iran on the grounds of violating international conventions concerning nuclear energy. The United States government says that it wants Iran to comply by discontinuing uranium enrichment in its facilities, and said Iran will be sent to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) over this dispute if Tehran maintains its refusal to comply with the international community Both sides are clearly determined in their position, which leads to an interesting development of Mohammad elBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), saying that the US and other nuclear powers should themselves disarm as well if they don't want to be hypocrites, ArabicNews.com reports. Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty states that: Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The United States has signed the NPT, but Israel has not. Another development which may foment further controversy also came Wednesday when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for a series of bombings in Ahvaz, a town near the border of Iraq, which left at least nine civilians dead. ""Traces of the occupiers of Iraq is evident in the Ahvaz events. They should take responsibility in this regard,"" Ahmadinejad remarked to Iranian state television stations today."
politics,"The online magazine, Salon.com claims to have received a DVD containing what may be all of the material from an Army investigation into the infamous Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. According to Salon's report, the DVD includes an investigative report by the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID). In a report by Special Agent James E. Seigmund, the summary of the content includes, ""a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts."" Salon claims their source is a uniformed officer who spent time at Abu Ghraib and is familiar with the CID investigation. The DVD of material is described as all from a period of October 18, 2003 to December 30,2003. In reporting on Salon's scoop, the Guardian reported that a Pentagon spokesman said recent reports, ""could only further inflame and possibly incite unnecessary violence in the world"". Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the Prime Minister of Iraq condemned the abuse, whilst pointing out that members of US Forces had already been punished for it. Whilst the Salon report concedes that prosecutions related to the abuse continue, it notes that none of the CIA interrogators who were said to operate at the prison have been prosecuted and no high-ranking officer or official has yet been charged in relation to the abuse."
politics,"North Korea In recent days, North Korea has been issuing threats of war to neighbouring South Korea and the United States. There has been an increase in tensions as well as the decision to close off the Kaesong Industrial Park to South Korean workers. Wikinews interviewed Dr. Robert Kelly of Pusan National University (PNU) in South Korea, who specialises in security and diplomacy, about the recent threats; and Scott Snyder, a North Korean specialist from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in the United States. Wikinews What is your job role? ::Dr. Robert Kelly: I am a Professor of International Relations at PNU. ::Scott Snyder: I am a senior fellow for Korea Studies and director of the program for U.S.&amp;ndash;Korea policy at CFR. WNIQ North Korea has issued many threats to South Korea, how likely do you think it is that they will carry out these threats? ::RK: Very unlikely. North Korea would lose a war if one began, and if they use nuclear weapons, they will lose all sympathy in global opinion and China will abandon them. The point of these threats is to shake-down SK South Korea and its new president for aid, not to start a war. Council of Foreign Relations ::SS: North Korea's threats have a variety of purposes. Some are defensive and are primarily meant to deter other countries from taking aggressive stances in the face of North Korea's own weakness; some are designed tactically to set up for negotiations; some are expressions of intent or aspiration that are beyond the capability of North Korea to implement without facing severe consequences, and some are very specific threats that North Korea will attempt to implement as part of a guerrilla strategy so as to avoid escalation and take advantage of the element of surprise. NK North Korean threats should be taken seriously, but evaluated carefully to determine circumstances under which they might actually be carried out. WNIQ How do people in South Korea feel about North Korea's nuclear weapon's programme? ::RK: They do not like it of course, but they worry far less about it than outsiders would expect. South Koreans have been living under this shadow for many years. The North has made many threats in the past. So NK is like the boy who cried wolf. No one expects them to launch a weapon. ::SS: Increasingly unsettled and concerned, especially about the possibility of being subject to nuclear blackmail. At the same time, this circumstance thus far has had negligible impact on South Koreans' daily lives. WNIQ Are South Korean citizens carrying on their day to day lives as normal? ::RK: Yes, they are. This is not like the Cuban Missile Crisis when people were emptying the store shelves and building bunkers in their basements. My students are coming and going like normal. Indeed, South Koreans' composure is very impressive. ::SS: Yes. WNIQ Is North Korea becoming further isolated in the world? ::RK: Yes, it is. Threatening nuclear war is a genuine escalation that would alienate any state. Importantly though, NK is already fairly isolated. And because China, its main aid supplier, does not cut it off, further isolation has few practical impacts. ::SS: North Korea is increasingly politically isolated but it is comparatively more economically and informationally connected than it was a decade ago. WNIQ Is the South Korean military well-prepared to deal with any conflicts with the North Korean military? ::RK: Yes. The ROKA Republic of Korea Army, of South Korea is a modern, well-trained, well-groomed force with substantial technical and organization superiority over the KPA Korean People's Army, of North Korea. To date, the South Koreans have not responded to Northern provocation in order to avoid escalation, not because they are incapable. SK conventional superiority is augmented further by US assistance. ::SS: South Korea will decisively win most direct conventional engagements with the North, but is vulnerable in selected theaters where North Korea perceives a lack of readiness or a tactical advantage. WNIQ Is the closure of Kaesong by North Korea, evidence of further escalating tensions between the two nations? ::RK: Yes and no. It is important, because it is a source of hard currency for the North, so its closure suggests that the North is willing to carry genuine costs over this feud. On the other hand, the SK media identified the closure of Kaesong early as a marker of NK seriousness, saying very openly that if NK did not close the facility, they did not really mean what they were saying. In other words, NK was, I think, goaded into closing Kaesong in the war of words, not as a part of any larger strategic plan. ::SS: Thus far, it is a symbolic evidence of potential for escalating tensions, but has not yet resulted in material changes. Let's see how the situation plays out over the next couple of days. Kaesong will only become vulnerable when operations halt and when financial transfers connected to failure of operations become operative. WNIQ North Korea has moved one of its missiles that carries a large range missile to its East Coast, is this a serious move? ::RK: I don't think it's as serious a move as the media has made it out to be. First of all they just moved one missile. Second of all, it's not clear that North Korea actually has nuclear warheads that are small enough to actually put on top of missiles; they tell us this but nuclear weapons are actually pretty heavy, which is why nuclear missiles are frequently quite large, so moving the weapon there doesn't necessarily mean it's pointed at the United States or Tokyo which I suppose would be the likely targets. It's not clear that it's necessarily a nuclear missile and it's not being fueled or anything so far as I know so again it's sort of more of the same... bluffing...sort of talking around the issue and sort of saying things that don't actually have genuine consequences so my sense is it's more of a war of words. WNIQ There's a lot of talk about Kim Jong-un being an inexperienced leader &amp;mdash; do you think he knows where the 'brink' lies? ::RK: That's actually a really good question. No, I don't, which is why we're having this whole conversation. Kim's father, Kim the second Kim Jong-il, was actually very good about this, ""good"" in quotations I suppose. He knew really well how to play this game, he knew really well how to play the South, particularly for aid, rice, assistance, fuel, things like that. The new guy — he's only been in there for a year-and-a-half, right, 14, 15 months — he didn't go through the grooming institutions of the regime, he didn't go through the military or the party. And he certainly has no military training, it's not like he went to some military institute — he went to some boarding school in Switzerland, or something like that. So it's not at all clear that this guy knows, sort of how this is done. I have a feeling myself that he's being egged on by the generals at home, and the generals are really doing this because they do not want the military's position to be lowered in the new order. Under the previous Kim, under the second Kim Kim-Jong-il, the military was raised in the constitution to a very high level of importance, they were sort of the primary pillar of the government, this is called the 'Military First' policy. I think people now worry that the new Kim — in order to re-start the economy might downgrade the role of the military, and I think that is where all this is coming from. I don't think they want a war. WNIQ All of these threats, do you think they are just a way of getting more economic aid from the United Nations? ::RK: I wouldn't say the United Nations UN because the UN role in this is actually pretty minimal. It is true that there are some UN specialized agencies that operate in North Korea — the World Food Programme I believe is the big one because North Korea constantly has food problems &amp;mdash; and there are western NGOs, and aid groups, charities and stuff like that, also operate in North Korea. I've actually been to North Korea and I've seen these charities operate. I've actually met some of the people who actually live there and do this stuff. But they're actually pretty small, right? I mean, the North Koreans are pretty worried about Westerners running around in North Korea making trouble and saying things and this and that. Any kind of foreign penetration in North Korea is very, very limited. I think the real issue is actually North Korea's neighbors, specifically Japan, China, the United States and South Korea. Russia's really sort of a bit player in this drama. And that's what they really want, the North Koreans now are very dependent on only the Chinese. They used to be able to play the Chinese off the South Koreans off the Japanese off the Americans and extract aid and concessions from each of those. In the last ten years or so it has become harder to do that — particularly Japan, the United States and South Korea have closed ranks and don't really deal individually with North Korea anymore. This has pushed North Korea to China. North Korea doesn't like being dependent on just one player. And so I think that's what this is an effort to shake up, ... a very difficult game for the North were they an economic colony of China."
politics,"Canada Operation NANOOK 2008 was held from August 11 to August 25 by the Canadian Forces for the purpose of conducting mock emergency rescue operations for potential maritime disasters in the northeastern Canadian Arctic waters. Two Canadian navy ships and two airforce planes, a CC-138 Twin Otter and a CP-140 Aurora, took part in the exercises in the Canada's Arctic. The HMCS Toronto and the Canadian Coast Guard ship Pierre Radisson travelled along the Hudson Strait. The Operation extended to Davis Strait, and Frobisher Bay during the annual NANOOK Operation. There have been 18 such humanitarian operations since 2002. As more Arctic ice melts, the ships sail through uncharted waters. Emergency response times were tested for such potential disasters as oil spills, or rescue operations such as responding to cruise ship emergencies. General Walter Natynczyk, Canada's chief of Defence staff, the Honourable Peter MacKay, Defence Minister as well as Minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and Steven Fletcher, Member of Parliament for Charleswood–St. James–Assiniboia and Parliamentary Secretary for Health, flew to Iqaluit, Nunavut to officially launch the exercise on August 19, 2008 and observe the process. In addition to the military exercises, Veterans Affairs Canada held a commemorative event onboard the HMCS Toronto to honour the 55th Anniversary of the Cease Fire in Korea, the 65th Anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, and the start of the Last 100 days of the First World War. The inaugural ceremonies were held during Community Day activities in the capital city of Iqaluit, followed by the public panel discussion held on Saturday. The community day ceremonies were organized by participants in Operation NANOOK 2008. The public ceremonies received neither Nunavut politicians nor Inuit leaders."
politics,"A meeting set for Tuesday by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could be a move closer to a showdown at the United Nations over the Iranian plan to resume uranium conversion at its Isfahan nuclear facility. Iran on Monday refused the weekend offer by the European Union (EU) of economic incentives that included help with nuclear-energy generation. The EU, led by Britain and France, both of which in May 2005 were considered to have violated the first pillar of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by failing to make serious efforts to dismantle their nuclear bomb stockpiles (preamble and Article VI of the treaty), and Germany, combined the offer with an exchange for Iran to verifiably give up all activities that could lead to a nuclear bomb. Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and say it is part of Iran's right to develop nuclear power, as is legally agreed to in the third pillar of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which gives all states the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. ""The proposals are unacceptable,"" Hossein Moussavian said. ""They negate Iran's inalienable right,"" said the top Iranian nuclear negotiator. The Iranian refusal, coming from under the new leadership of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, would probably trigger the referral of Iran to the UN Security Council. Iran began uranium conversion shortly after IAEA inspectors installed cameras and other surveillance equipment at their nuclear facility. The facility carried out an early stage of the fuel cycle, which includes turning raw uranium (yellowcake) into gas. France and Britain condemned Iran's actions. The IAEA sealed sensitive equipment at Iran's uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, as part of Tehran's earlier compliance with a Paris agreement. An Al-Jazeera report said the IAEA seals on the plants' sensitive equipment was recently removed. In a IAEA statement issued Monday, Reuters reports, ""It should be noted that the sealed parts of the process line remain intact."""
politics,"Swaziland Around 50 people have been arrested ahead of a planned human rights protest in Swaziland. The protest had been planned against the monarchy of Swaziland to call attention to the country's alleged lack of human rights. Many of those arrested have been released but several people remain in custody. The King of Swaziland, Mswati III, has come under pressure for living in luxury with his thirteen wives while many Swazi people are on the poverty line. He has also faced criticism for having a high number of sexual partners, when 26% of 15 to 49 year olds are HIV positive. Several South African trade unionists were included in the protesters arrested. A spokesman for Cosatu, the South African trade union federation, said that two of the unionists had not been released and their current whereabouts are unknown. Human rights group Amnesty International has commented on the events saying that, ""The arbitrary arrest of these political activists, lawyers, trade unionists and journalists is nothing short of police harassment and intimidation."" Swaziland is the last country in Africa to hold an absolute monarchy."
politics,"Canada Whistle-blower Richard Colvin is being targeted by the Canadian government with reprisals for his report to Parliament in November in which he presented evidence the Harper government was complicit in torturing Afghan detainees &amp;mdash; many of whom were likely innocent of any crime. Coupled with the Government's public attacks on Mr. Colvin and his testimony before the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan (the ""Committee""), our client is left with the reasonable belief that the denial of further legal indemnification is a reprisal for his participation before the Committee and the Commission. In a letter to the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC), Colvin's Toronto lawyer Owen Rees expresses concern over the government's complete failure to make any response &amp;mdash; either to Colvin or to the MPCC. The government stopped paying Colvin's legal fees in November after his damning testimony before the House of Commons's special committee on Afghanistan. The special committee had called Colvin to testify in their ongoing into what Canadian Forces knew, or should have known, about the fate of detainees turned over to Afghan authorities due to their responsibilities to the Geneva Convention. Colvin testified he repeatedly warned officials regarding the treatment of prisoners by Afghan authorities, and presented evidence the government was aware of circumstances. This latest revelation comes as the Canadian Parliament has been prorogued for three months, until after the Vancouver Olympics, by the minority Harper government, with some members of the opposition parties pointing to Colvin's testimony and the whole Afghan detainee issue as the reason to dismiss the legislature. His testimony was publicly attacked by members of government, in particular by Defense Minister Peter MacKay. As a federal civil servant summoned by Parliament regarding his official work Colvin is entitled to legal representation. The government agreed his earlier government-employed lawyer could not fairly represent both Colvin and the government, but has refused to provide funding for any other legal representation despite the ongoing MPCC investigation. The MPCC's own investigation into detainee transfers is awaiting the government's appointment of a new MPCC Commissioner. Colvin continues to hold his position as head of intelligence at the Canadian Embassy in Washington."
politics,"Albania On Saturday Albania's Interior Ministry blamed Iranian actors for a cyberattack on Friday evening which targeted the national police's computer systems. Albania reported a previous attack in July. The ministry said in a statement ""the national police’s computer systems were hit Friday by a cyberattack which, according to initial information, was committed by the same actors who in July attacked the country’s public and government service systems"". The attack comes days after Iran was blamed for the attack in July. The statement also said the authorities had deliberately closed down their border crossing management software ""in order to neutralise the criminal act and secure the systems"", with local media reporting queues at border crossings. On Wednesday the Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama accused Iran of directing the attack against Albanian institutions on July 15, stating it was a bid to ""paralyse public services and hack data and electronic communications from the government systems"". While Rama went on to say that the attack failed in its purpose, he also stated that Albania was severing diplomatic ties with Iran, giving Iranian embassy staff 24 hours to leave the country. The Associated Press called this the first known case of diplomatic ties being cut over a cyberattack. Iran called the accusations ""baseless"" and deemed the cutting of diplomatic ties to be ""ill-considered and short-sighted"". On Friday the US imposed sanctions against the Iranian intelligence agency in response to the July attack. NATO, of which Albania is a member, and the European Union also denounced the attack. Iran and Albania have been foes since 2013 when Albania agreed to host members of the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran, also known as Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), at the request of the US and United Nations. MEK is an Iranian opposition group, and considered a terrorist group by Iran."
politics,"More than half a million people have been displaced in Lebanon as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah continues into its second week. The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland, who visited Beirut said that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and outlined planned relief efforts. Efforts are underway to open a safe corridor to allow aid shipments to be sent to Lebanon. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues. Israel launched more air strikes and also a ground incursion into Lebanon, and Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on northern Israel. UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland flew to Beirut for a 48 hour visit to Lebanon focused on assistance required by people displaced or trapped by the conflict. He visited Haret Hreik, a crowded Beirut neighborhood where Hezbollah had its headquarters, hours after it was bombed by Israel. Calling the destruction there ""horrific"", he said, ""I did not know it was block after block of houses,... It makes it a violation of humanitarian law"". Mr. Egeland appealed for both sides to put a halt to attacks. The Israeli government said the military was trying to be as precise as possible in its operations in Lebanon. ""The Lebanese people are not our enemy. We cannot sit idly by while Hezbollah terrorists launch rockets at our towns and cities,"" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said. Mr. Egeland said there was a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, and more than half a million people were directly affected. He said that wounded people were unable to get treatment, no safe drinking water was available and that tens of thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah militants, particularly in south Lebanon. He expected the number of displaced to increase ""dramatically"" as Israel has warned the population of south Lebanon to leave the area ahead of possible new military action there. Outlining plans for a ""major"" relief operation, he called for an end to violence to facilitate the aid effort, saying, ""We can't get relief into the country in any quantity or distribute it beyond a few points"". 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict The Lebanese newspaper Daily Star reports that the number of displaced people in Lebanon passed 900,000 on Friday, with close to 40,000 refugees in Beirut itself. Other estimates place the number of refugees between half a million and a million. Israel has urged the remaining people living in south Lebanon to leave, and streams of people, some carrying white flags, are making their way from the south. About 42,000 refugees had flooded into the city of Sidon from the surrounding countryside - believing it to be safe from attacks - when it was hit by Israeli strikes today. In several towns and cities, food, medical supplies and fuel stocks are running low, and municipal authorities have expressed their inability to assist people. They have called for urgent shipments of food products such as milk, rice, sugar and canned meat; diapers and kitchen tools; medicine such as insulin, painkillers, antibiotics and chlorine to clean water; sterilized gloves; refrigerators to store medicine; tents; electrical generators of 5, 10, 20 and 30 kVA; blankets and other necessities. In the government hospital in the Al-Bass Palestinian refugee camp, the mass burial of 86 bodies was begun, after rising casualties overwhelmed the local morgue. The air strikes and bombardment of roads, bridges and trucks has made supplying aid to affected areas even more difficult. Lebanon's only international airport has been out of action since the first days of the conflict. Reports estimate that billions of dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed. The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland spoke to reporters of the plans for getting aid to Lebanon. He said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would begin to arrive in the next few days. ""But we need safe access,"" he said. ""So far Israel is not giving us access."" He estimated that US $100 million is urgently needed to help the half a million to one million people in Lebanon who were in need of international assistance. U.N. and other relief agencies have been asking for humanitarian aid corridors to be opened up. Israel said it opened a 50-mile-long and five-mile-wide (80-kilometre by eight-kilometre) safe passage to Beirut for ships and aircraft to allow aid into Lebanon. Egeland said the United Nations was planning to deliver aid by setting up humanitarian corridors in the next few days. Aid will be shipped by road and by sea from Cyprus to Beirut and the southern city of Tyre, and by air. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues, with most being taken to the island of Cyprus, where temporary accommodation has to be found for the estimated 70,000 evacuees, in the middle of the holiday tourist season. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) says that it plans to evacuate civilians from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the next few days, but ""the ability to move will depend on the situation on the ground"". Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis have been living in bomb shelters since the fighting in Lebanon started and between a third to a half of all residents in northern Israel have left the area to escape the bombardment, officials said. ""For a week people have been sitting in shelters and security rooms, so they prefer to leave,"" said Adi Eldar, mayor of Carmiel in a report on Haaretz newspaper's Web site. On Saturday, more television stations and mobile telephone masts in Lebanon were targeted in Israeli strikes, killing five people, including a television station employee. Israel struck Beirut, Sidon, a port city in the south crammed with refugees, for the first time and factories, roads and bridges in air strikes in the eastern Baalbek region, killing one person. In Haifa, two people were killed by rockets fired by Hezbollah forces, and fifteen people are reported injured. Current estimates say that more than 350 Lebanese and at least 36 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. One third of those killed in Lebanon are children, according to a UN report released July 21."
politics,"Iraq Lord Peter Goldsmith, the Attorney General for England and Wales before and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has told the Iraq Inquiry that he changed his mind about the legality of the invasion about one month before military action began. During his six hour session of questioning, Goldsmith said that he changed his mind about whether a further United Nations resolution was needed to ensure that the invasion was legal. His testimony comes only a day after former foreign office legal advisor Michael Wood told the inquiry that his own advice, that a further resolution was required, was ignored in favour of Goldsmith's. Goldsmith's account was under scrutiny because he had consistently said that it would be ""safer"" if a further resolution were obtained—since it would have put the ""matter beyond doubt and nobody could have challenged the legality""—before changing his mind and giving the ""green light"" only a month before the invasion. He said that he had ""good reasons"" for ""ultimately reaching a different view"", and called his previous advice ""too cautious"". He based his support of the war's legality on a series of UN resolutions dating back to the end of the Gulf War. Until February 2002, he believed that a new resolution would be required, but he said today that—after discussions with US and UK diplomats—he realised that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 ""revived"" the authority of the United Kingdom to use force, as outlined in previous resolutions. One of these was United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which was passed in November 1990. It authorized ""Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area"" against Iraq if Saddam Hussein failed to give up his weapons of mass destruction. However, there has been debate about whether ""all means necessary"" included military force. source=Peter Goldsmith He admitted that he had told then prime minister Tony Blair, as far back as 2002, that any justification for war other than a UN resolution (such as regime change or self defence) would be invalid. Goldsmith said, ""I don't think it the advice was terribly welcome."" However, he added, ""The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it."" Goldsmith agreed that he ignored the advice of other legal advisors, including Michael Wood (who spoke before the inquiry yesterday) and Elizabeth Wilmshurst (who resigned in protest days before the invasion), who both said that invading Iraq without a new UN resolution would amount to the ""crime of aggression"". Goldsmith claimed to have ""paid great attention to what their views were,"" but added, ""Ultimately I disagreed with the views they took."" He said that an ""unequivocal"" opinion was needed before the invasion, and that this was what he gave in March, having been unsure about the war's legality previously. He denied changing his mind only days before the invasion, as some have claimed, saying that he had advised the government that the war would be legal as far back as February, and that his advice was ""consistent"". He also called claims that he was pressured into changing his opinion ""nonsense"". He said that he ""was ready to answer questions"" and intended to debate the issue with the cabinet, but was told that they would read his advice before moving on to different issues. He said that the debate did not in fact take place – he told the inquiry that he believes cabinet ministers considered it to be ""a slightly sterile exercise"". In his testimony, Goldsmith also criticised Jack Straw's response to Wood's advice, saying that, while ministers could ""challenge"" legal advice, Straw ""appeared to be rebuking a senior legal adviser for expressing his own legal view"" in a recently declassified letter. He was also concerned that the cabinet ignored, or was unaware of, the caveats included in his March advice on the war's legality, in which he said that ""the safest legal course"" would be to get a new resolution, despite a ""reasonable case"" being available based on existing resolutions. His advice warned the government that he was not ""confident"" that the case based on existing resolutions would stand up in court. Goldsmith also requested the declassification of documents relating to the war's legal status, which are available to the Iraq inquiry, but not to the public. Sir John Chilcot, the chair of the inquiry, said that Goldsmith's ""frustration is shared."""
politics,"Canada's scandal-plagued Liberal party has survived a series of 15 confidence votes late last night, ensuring Canadians won't be forced to head to the polls in a snap election this summer. The minority government's win came amidst uncertainty over whether backbench MPs would force an election over the contentious issue of same-sex marriage. But Prime Minister Paul Martin has yet another hurdle to jump with a key vote on Thursday over the government's second budget bill. The bill is an amendment that came about as a result of a deal reached with the NDP Party in April, when the party's leader, Jack Layton, offered to support the Liberals if they would amend the budget to cancel corporate tax cuts due to be phased in over several years. The budget deal with the NDP outlines $4.6 billion in spending for infrastructure, education, foreign aid and the environment. Martin's government has been plagued by a sponsorship scandal over irregularities in public advertising contracts dating back to the 1990s awarded by the previous administration."
politics,"Mogadishu, capital of Somalia, is witnessing a heavy fighting over the past four days. Almost 100 people have died and 200 have been wounded in the clashes, as health officials said yesterday. The battle between the Islamic Court Union and the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counterterrorism has centered on the northern neighborhood of Sii-Sii. Many of the casualties are civilians caught in the crossfire. There was a temporary truce, but that did not last long. Islamic militia leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed called a unilateral truce on Tuesday in response to appeals from those affected by the violence. But his opponents said the truce was called because of a lack of ammunition. The warlords' alliance spokesman Hussein Gutale Rageh said they would only accept the ceasefire if their rivals withdrew from territory they have occupied during the fighting. The fighting started late on Sunday, when an alliance of warlords attacked the vehicle of a group allied to the Islamic courts, according to eyewitnesses. This is the second round of the city's most serious fighting in a decade. In March 2006, clashes between the two sides killed at least 90 people. The United Nations has appealed to both sides to halt the clashes. UN special representative for Somalia, Francois Lonseny Fall, appealed today for the rival militias to end the hostilities, saying they had created fear and chaos for civilians caught in the crossfire. ""The indiscriminate use of heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and artillery in and between urban areas is unacceptable,"" said Francois Fall. Somalia has not had an effective national authority for 15 years after the ousting of longtime dictator President Siad Barre in 1991. A UN-backed transitional government has based itself in the central city of Baidoa, but has so far failed to assert itself elsewhere. Islamic fundamentalists have portrayed themselves as an alternative capable of bringing order and peace, but they have not hesitated to use force and have allegedly linked up with al-Qaeda terrorists. The Islamic courts have restored order to some parts of the city by providing justice under Sharia - Islamic law. The courts say the warlords alliance is a pawn of the United States. Last week, Somalia President Abdullahi Yusuf accused the US of funding the coalition of warlords. The US government says it does support efforts to restore stability to Somalia but refuses to give details on who it backs and how. The alliance of warlords recently created the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. It has an anti-terror task force based in nearby Djibouti. It accuses the Islamic courts of sheltering foreign al-Qaeda leaders."

politics,"IsraelUnited States and United Kingdom spokespeople have added to criticism from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Israel's decision to authorise a further 900 homes in east Jerusalem will ""undermine efforts for peace and cast doubt on the viability of the two-state solution"". A spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon stated, ""The Secretary-General deplores the Government of Israel’s decision today to expand Gilo settlement, built on Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war."" The US rebuked Israel for their decision. ""We are dismayed at the Jerusalem planning committee's decision to move forward on the approval process for the expansion of Gilo in Jerusalem,"" said White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs. ""At a time when we are working to relaunch negotiations, these actions make it more difficult for our efforts to succeed,"" he said, referring to the attempts by the US to lead the peace process. ""Neither party should engage in efforts or take actions that could unilaterally pre-empt, or appear to pre-empt, negotiations."" US Department of State spokesperson Ian Kelly added, ""We object to this, and we object to other Israeli practices in Jerusalem related to housing, including the continuing pattern of evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes."" source=Spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonThe British consulate in Jerusalem issued a statement on behalf of Foreign Secretary David Miliband that read, ""The Foreign Secretary has been very clear that a credible deal involves Jerusalem as a shared capital. Expanding settlements on occupied land in East Jerusalem makes that deal much harder. So this decision is wrong and we oppose it."" According to Israel Army Radio, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a request from the US Middle East envoy George Mitchell on Monday to halt building in the area on the grounds that that Gilo was ""an integral part of Jerusalem"". ""Prime Minister Netanyahu … is willing to adopt the policy of the greatest possible restraint concerning growth in the West Bank, but this applies to the West Bank,"" said the Prime Minister's spokesperson Mark Regev. ""Jerusalem is Israel's capital and will remain as such."" Following the suspension of peace talks last year, the Palestinian National Authority has demanded a halt to all construction of settlements before it will return to negotiations. President Mahmud Abbas said that the breakdown in talks left him with no choice but to seek international recognition of a Palestinian state unilaterally, despite requests from the United States and the European Union to resume peace talks. ""We feel we are in a very difficult situation,"" he said in Cairo after talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak. ""What is the solution for us? To remain suspended like this, not in peace? That is why I took this step."" This comes as another blow to United States President Barack Obama, whose attempts at brokering a deal to halt settlement expansion are meeting with little success. With the credibility of the US leader diminishing, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has recently started meeting with a number of Middle East leaders in the past week, attempting to reconcile with Syria and meeting with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia."
politics,"The United States Supreme Court has rejected a bid by gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans to have the US Military's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy rescinded again. A Federal court in California had previously ruled the policy, which restricts personnel from discussing their sexuality, unconstitutional. In October, US District Judge Virginia Phillips ruled that since the policy prevented gays from talking about their lives it is a breach of their constitutional right to freedom of speech. She forbade by injunction any use of the policy, later nullified by an appeals court decision. This allowed the policy to stay in place until the Obama administration had a chance to appeal the decision&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; While President Obama supports the lifting of the ban, he has made it clear that he would prefer the decision to be made by Congress, not the courts, which is why he wants the court verdicts struck down. The Supreme Court decision means the policy can now be applied once more, while the original ruling of unconstitutionality is contested. Under the terms of ""Don't ask, don't tell"", initiated in 1993, homosexuals can serve in the US Forces, under the condition that they do not openly admit to being gay; if they do, they can be dismissed. It is also not permitted under the policy to inquire as to whether any member is homosexual&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; again, an offence for which someone can be dismissed. R. Clarke Cooper, Executive Director of the group, said in a statement ""Log Cabin Republicans are disappointed that the Supreme Court decided to maintain the status quo with regards to ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ but we are not surprised."" The House of Representatives passed a measure earlier this year to repeal the policy, but Republicans in the Senate have so far blocked any action on the issue."
politics,"ScientologyThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of the government of the United Kingdom told the City of London Police on Friday that there will be no prosecution for a 15-year-old boy who called Scientology a ""cult"" at a May 10 peaceful protest. The City of London Police had previously confiscated the boy's protest placard and gave him a court summons at the demonstration, which took place near St Paul's Cathedral at the Church of Scientology's London headquarters on Queen Victoria Street. The boy's poster read: ""Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult"". The human rights organization Liberty has come out strongly against the City of London Police for their actions at the protest, and said they are pursuing an inquiry into the police force for what they say is a troubling freedom of speech issue. Individuals from the group Anonymous have held monthly international protests against the Church of Scientology since February, as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring Tom Cruise removed from websites YouTube and Gawker.com. Members of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. 4=15-year-old boy City of London Police approached the 15-year-old boy at the May 10 protest and cited section five of the Public Order Act 1986, which deals with ""harassment, alarm or distress"". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice of Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales, in which Latey called Scientology a ""cult"" and said it was ""corrupt, sinister and dangerous"". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: ""Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. ... In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. ... It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others."" The boy told fellow protesters he was not going to take the sign down, saying: ""If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here holding up his sign, I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or given a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen."" 4=Crown Prosecution Service When the boy refused to take his sign down, City of London Police removed it, cited him with a court summons and informed him that the matter would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The boy was the only protester who did not comply with the police requests to remove signs which referred to Scientology as a ""cult"". According to The Guardian, a CPS spokesman stated Friday that: ""In consultation with the City of London police, we were asked whether the sign, which read 'Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult', was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression. No action will be taken against the individual."" ""The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice,"" said a spokeswoman for the City of London Police in a statement in The Guardian. The 15-year-old boy's mother called the CPS decision a ""victory for free speech"", saying: ""We're all incredibly proud of him. We advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said 'No, it's my opinion and I have a right to express it'."" The incident has generated significant interest on the Internet, from civil rights groups and anti-cult groups, and in the press. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, and Ian Haworth of the United Kingdom-based Cult Information Centre were highly critical of the actions of the City of London Police. George Pitcher of The Daily Telegraph called the actions of the City of London Police ""a mockery of the law"". Other publications also criticized the actions of the police, compared the boy to past civil rights protesters, and analyzed how the characterization of ""cult"" applied to Scientology. The Guardian reported that human rights activists ""were outraged"" when reports of the actions of the City of London Police at the protest surfaced this week. Marina Hyde wrote in a comment piece in The Guardian that the City of London Police should spend a little less time ""reaching for the collar of free-speaking children"". An article in The Guardian about the boy's court summons hit the front page of the website Slashdot on Wednesday, and an article about the statement by CPS hit the site's front page on Friday. The anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org devoted its front page to the incident on Saturday. 4=James Welch, legal director at Liberty BBC News reported that attorneys for Liberty represented the 15-year-old boy to the CPS. In media statements Friday, Liberty said it would continue its inquiry into the actions of the City of London Police. ""The police may have ended their inquiries into this tawdry incident but rest assured that Liberty's inquiry will continue. Democracy is all about clashing ideas and the police should protect peaceful protest, not stifle it,"" said James Welch, legal director at Liberty. ""Reason has prevailed in the case of the anti-Scientology protester"", wrote Welch in a comment piece in The Observer. According to The Press Association, Liberty's inquiry may result in actions taken against the City of London Police. The City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to The Guardian over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. Unlike the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service (the territorial police force responsible for Greater London excluding the City of London) has not raised an issue with protesters using placards with similar wording at protests against Scientology, according to The Guardian and Londonist. Each of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of Lisa McPherson, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of ""Fair Game"" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite ""Sea Organization"" or ""Sea Org"".

politics,"United States Edward Snowden, a US National Security Agency (NSA) whistle-blower who has been in exile since 2013, would like to return to the United States providing he is guaranteed a ""fair and impartial trial"", said Anatoly Kucherena, his Russian lawyer, yesterday. The US Attorney General has promised Snowden he will not be executed if he is convicted under the Espionage Act, however, Kucherena says, he has not been promised the fair trial he seeks. Kucherena also said the US Attorney General does not have legal power to enforce the promise of no execution. Reportedly, ""fair"", to Snowden's lawyers, requires he would not be tried under the Espionage Act. Snowden has been on the run since leaking classified information regarding the NSA's mass electronic surveillance of the US population to the mainstream media. Upon returning to the US, Snowden would still have to face trial on two counts of theft of government property. If he were found guilty on both counts he would serve an up to 30-year prison sentence. Spokesman for the US Justice Department Marc Raimondi, in remarks to Reuters, reiterated the position of the US on the case, saying, ""Snowden is not a whistle-blower. He is accused of leaking classified information and there is no question his actions have inflicted serious harms on our national security"". Kucherena said he is working alongside lawyers from both Germany and the US in order to ensure that a fair trial can be negotiated."

politics,"Following a bill, which was passed with approximately 81% by the 207 MPs attending, Iran's parliament wants Iran to review its compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This was the first time since the 1979 revolution that a bill was passed in five minutes. This bill was given double-urgency status, making it a higher priority over everything else. This passage occurs after the UN implemented sanctions against Iran for continuing its nuclear program; the new law permits for Iran to continue its program against the UN's wishes. This new law allows President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to take action about the use of nuclear energy in Iran, including establishing conditions of inspections by the UN. However, the bill does not authorize the complete end of inspections. The UN's atomic agency's governors may meet in January to consider imposing more sanctions if Iran does not end its nuclear program 60 days after the sanctions imposed on Saturday by the UN Security Council. Iran is considering withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
politics,"George Allen, incumbent Republican Senator from Virginia, conceded the state's mid-term election to Democratic challenger Jim Webb on Thursday. Democrats have now gained the six seats needed by the party to hold majority control of the Senate. ""The people of Virginia have spoken, they have spoken in a closely divided voice. We have two 49ers,"" Allen said during the afternoon press conference in Arlington. Allen garnered 49.25% of the vote, compared to the 49.55% who supported Webb. ""I do not wish to cause more rancor by protracted litigation that would not, in my opinion, alter the results."" The concession by Allen in traditionally Republican Virginia follows what were once prospects for an Allen 2008 presidential bid. An easy Allen re-election campaign to the Senate was expected, but what came was the Democrats ability to frame the election as a national referendum on the war in Iraq. Democrats may have succeeded nationally to draw on the issue of Iraq, but local politics were very much in play in Northern Virginia. According to the Virginia Pilot, ""Unofficial returns gave Democratic nominee Webb a 120,000-vote advantage over Allen in Northern Virginia's eight localities. But Webb trailed badly across most of the rest of the state and would have decisively lost the election without his Northern Virginia support."" The margin by which Webb won was 9,000 votes. Allen's formulaic stance against tax increases, whether for highway taxes to improve congested northern highway and commuter corridors, or outright fiscal conservativism of all taxes in the face of a burgeoning national deficit, worked against him. The state constitutional amendment banning recognition of same-sex marriage supported by Allen, but opposed by Webb and Governor Tim Kaine, and most Northern Virginians, worked against Allen in the election."
politics,"John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), condemned both the US-installed Iraqi government and the US Armed Forces for breach of human rights, centring largely around widespread detention without authority or trial. ""There is no question that terrorism has to be addressed. But we are equally sure that the remedies being applied... are not the best way of eliminating terrorism,"" Pace said during an interview on Sunday. He quoted instances where Iraqi judges had ordered the release of groups of prisoners, and had found not only that their orders had been refused, but found themselves locked up as a reprisal. On the subject of the Saddam Hussein trial resuming Monday, Pace told Reuters, ""Weakness in the system of administration of justice, in addition to the antecedents surrounding the establishment of this tribunal, will never be able to produce the kind of process that would be able to satisfy international standards."" He also pointed out that the Iraqi authorities are the only legal entity allowed to detain prisoners, and that the US prison camps at Abu Ghraib and similar locations are therefore technically illegal."
politics,"YemenThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that 200,000 people in Yemen have been displaced by ongoing violence, and that the growing number of refugees is straining the ability of aid agencies to shelter and care for those forced to flee their homes. The refugee agency reports that thousands of civilians in north Yemen are fleeing to neighboring provinces in a desperate search for safety, shelter and assistance, as the current wave of fighting between the government and the al-Houthi rebel group is entering its sixth month. It added that it is fast running out of space and money to care for them. ""We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year,"" said UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic. ""These newly displaced people bring stories of intense clashes in Razeh, Saqain and Sahar districts and report dozens of civilian casualties as a result of air strikes and heavy fighting,"" Mahecic added, as quoted by Voice of America. ""UNHCR is not present in the conflict area and has no independent confirmation of these reports. ""We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been affected by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year,"" he continued. The spokesman noted that camps for the displaced are stretched to capacity, and aid resources are quickly becoming depleted. News24 reports that one camp at Al Mazrak in the Hajjah province is now home to 21,000 people, double its intended capacity, and others were also being populated quickly and in dire conditions. ""The shelter situation is equally dire in Amran province where most of the arriving IDPs are staying with host families or renting places. Over the New Year's week alone, more than 5,000 IDPs arrived to Amran City,"" Mahecic said. ""The acute lack of shelter and accommodation is creating tensions between the displaced and the local population. In the absence of an immediate and feasible camp option, UNHCR is planning to set up a transit center in Amran as an interim and temporary solution,"" he concluded. The UN has issued a US$177-million appeal on behalf of all UN agencies working in Yemen; so far, less than one percent of that has been received."

politics,"Iran nuclear program Governors of the United Nations nuclear agency IAEA approved cuts in technical aid to Iran in accordance with UN sanctions. The move reflected UN Security Council Resolution 17-37 passed last December that bans the transfer of technology or expertise that might aid in producing nuclear fuel. The 35-nation board, which is often split over issues on Iran, came to a consensus in ratifying the recommendation of the IAEA's Secretariat to suspend 22 of 55 technical aid programs involving Iran. These consist of four national programs in Iran and 18 regional or trans-regional programs that involve the country. The board did not suspend 33 other programs (11 national and 22 regional) all of which focus on medical and agricultural radio-pharmaceuticals and isotopes. The United States and France who fund much of the IAEA's special aid programs had originally demanded more sweeping reductions. Ali Akbar Velayati, international affairs advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that the IAEA's decision was ""politically-motivated"". Ali-Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, said his nation will not stop uranium enrichment activities and that suspended programs are not part of Iran's nuclear enrichment program and the sanctions will have no effect on it. He stated ""The enrichment program has been indigenous and independent, nobody, even the IAEA, have co-operated or worked with us. Therefore these projects will continue as planned under the supervision of the IAEA."" Soltanieh declared that the action had been dictated by the U.N. Security Council, and that this was an illegal act undermining the IAEA's professional independence. IAEA board members joined in supporting IAEA's Director General Mohamed ElBaradei call for a ""double suspension"" where both enrichment and sanctions would stop concurrently. Only North Korea and Saddam Hussein's Iraq have been stripped of nuclear aid because of fear of weapons development."
politics,"UPDATE: Chinese Asylum Seeker Ends Hunger Strike After 54 Days. ---- A Chinese man in Australian immigration detention is still refusing food, seven weeks after starting his hunger strike. Jen Wen Zhang, a detainee at Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, has refused food since October 20. Mr Zhang and five other Chinese asylum seekers began the strike in protest at Australia's Mandatory Detention policy. Five of the six hunger strikers ended their protest in November. The Department of Immigration (DIMIA) says Mr Zhang is continuing his hunger strike after being hospitalised a fortnight ago. Now back in Villawood he is being closely monitored. A DIMMIA spokesperson said Mr Zhang was being urged to end his strike. The government continues to resist Mr Zhang's protest. ""As the minister said, his actions will not influence his migration status or outcomes,"" said the spokesperson. Victorian Greens refugees spokesman, Peter Job, has been speaking to Mr Zhang, and said the asylum seeker is determined to continue to strike despite his ailing health. Mr Job said Mr Zhang believes he was denied a fair hearing from the Immigration Department and the Refugee Review Tribunal, but was taking political action for all detained asylum seekers. ""He felt he had no option but to fight in the only way he could, with his body,"" said Mr Job. ""But above all, he spoke of his dread of long-term detention, telling of waking continually in the morning with a sense of profound despair and foreboding due to his incarceration, and telling me he feared the mental health damage he had seen in so many long-term detainees,"" he said. Mr Job says he has tried to convince Mr Zhang to stop the hunger strike, but says he is in a desperate state. ""He is very upset, he feels that he will be in great danger if he returns to China,"" Mr Job said. ""He said he'd rather die here in Australia than go back to China, where he's convinced he'll be persecuted. Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) spokesman Ian Rintoul said the Immigration Department has been riddled with problems and too often rejected long-term detainees who are genuine refugees. ""The government itself has recognised there have been many mistakes in the department's processes, there have been many problems with the way asylum seekers have been dealt with,"" Mr Rintoul said. ""That's why we're desperately trying to urge the government to intervene in this particular case."" Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said in mid November that the Government has done all it can for the Chinese asylum seeker. ""I don't support this kind of protest, I don't think anyone does, I recognise the risk it can play for the protesters themselves,"" she said. ""I've written to them urging them to get off their protest and making it clear to them that the Government doesn't consider cases while people are engaging in this sort of potentially very harmful protest."" Another Villawood detainee, Motahar Hussein, says Mr Zheng's health has drastically deteriorated and suspects that vital organs have experienced permanent damage. ""Though DIMIA continuously attempts to devise creative ways of crushing Mr. Jun Wen Zhang's spirit, he will not be easily intimidated,"" said Mr Hussein in a media release. ""He is willing and determined to continue with his peaceful and civilised protest. He believes he has no other option. He finds himself compelled to do so by the Howard Government's policy of inhumane and indefinite detention. He is prepared to continue to the supreme and utmost sacrifice of his own life, hopefully, in an attempt to expose DIMIA's attitude of injustice and corruption."" *date=November 13, 2005"
politics,"LGBT On Saturday, over a hundred thousand people reportedly gathered in Taiwan's capital Taipei and participated in the 16th annual lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual (LGBT) Pride. According to the organisers, about 137 thousand people participated in the largest LGBT Pride of Asia. People marched with banners and placards which read ""love is equal"" and ""vote for your happy future"". Of the many attendees, Chi Chia-wei also participated in the parade. Civil rights activist Chi Chia-wei was first to come out as homosexual on Taiwan TV, in 1986. Pride attendees gathered near the President Tsai Ing-wen's office where the Pride parade started. The attendees protested for education of same-sex marriage in schools. In May 2017, the Taiwanese court had ruled same-sex marriage as legal, and had set a two-year period for its legalisation including the time to amend the law, if required. With just six months remaining from the proposed deadline, some groups including some catholic churches have been pushing for preventing same-sex getting a legal recognition, saying marriage is ""a bond between one man and one woman."" Taiwan's court ruled Article 972 of Civil code ""unconstitutional"", which defined marriage only between opposite genders, but a separate public vote is scheduled to happen on November 24 regarding the law about same-sex marriage. During the LGBT Pride, drag queen Chin Kuang-chih said, ""We hope the government will take the issue seriously. It's a pity that there has been no action after the court decision"". At the scheduled deadline, same-sex marriage is to be automatically legalised if the government does not reach a conclusion about the law. Taiwan Pride was first organised in 2003."

Dozens of refugees and aid workers died. The lowest estimate from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is of 50 dead. The BBC estimates at least 52 dead, while one Borno State official is attributed by AP as saying over 100 are dead. MSF say at least 200 were wounded. The Red Cross said at least six of its staff died and twelve more injured. The impoverished region, in the northeast of the nation, has suffered severe famine as conflict interrupts agriculture. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross said volunteers were at the camp, home to thousands, to distribute food. The military said the Air Force was dispatched to deal with ""remnants"" of the Boko Haram militant group, which it claims to be in a final push against. Major General Leo Irabor, who led the operation, said, ""Unfortunately, the strike was conducted but it turned out that other civilians were somewhere around the area and they were affected"". Irabor said two soldiers were amongst the dead and others were wounded. Military spokesman General Rabe Abubakar said the military are ""all in pain"" after the disaster, adding ""in a military operation such as this, from time to time these things do occur."" Irabor promised an investigation. President Muhammadu Buhari said he was saddened by ""this regrettable operational mistake"" and sought calm. ""This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,"" MSF operational chief Dr Jean-Clément Cabrol said. The Red Cross said it has staff and facilities ready in neighbouring Cameroon and Chad to assist. ""The whole camp is controlled by the army and no one can come in or out without being checked,"" said MSF head of emergencies Hugues Robert. Robert added the group knew travel and work in the area was dangerous, and took precautions. Helicopters have been evacuating the wounded, including a United Nations helicopter which brought four medical personnel and 400kg (900lb) of emergency medical aid, and left with eight wounded Red Cross workers. The UN is in the midst of an appeal for aid to the famine-hit region."
politics,"Canadian news Foreign affairs minister Peter MacKay was accused last week of calling Liberal MP Belinda Stronach a ""dog"" in the House of Commons. Stronach, a feminist, said the comment was offensive to all women. NDP leader Jack Layton said on Saturday that MacKay should apologise or resign. MacKay said that he did not call her a dog. ""I made no such gesture. I made no derogatory or discriminatory remark toward any member of the House,"" MacKay said yesterday in the House of Commons. Despite MacKay's comment, the Liberals are still asking for an apology."
politics,"The United States Supreme Court has heard a plea that terrorism suspects being held at the U.S. Naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, should be given the opportunity to challenge their detention in American courts. Demonstrators outside the court chanted and waved signs calling on the nine high court justices to grant the detainees habeus corpus, the age-old legal principle that allows prisoners to challenge their detention before a neutral judge. Inside the court, attorney and former US Solicitory General Seth Waxman argued on behalf of a group of 37 detainees, part of the 305 prisoners now being held at Guantánamo. ""All have been confined at Guantánamo for almost six years,"" he said. ""Yet, not one has ever had meaningful notice of the factual grounds of detention, or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds before a neutral decision-maker."" But Waxman appeared to have little success in convincing some of the high court's more conservative justices that the Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in court. Among the skeptical was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. ""You are appealing to a common law right that somehow found its way into our Constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single case in which the writ right was ever issued to a non-citizen,"" he said. Some of the other justices appeared more sympathetic, including Justice Stephen Breyer. ""Now it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be speedy, and yet people have serious arguments anyway that they are being held for six years without even having those arguments heard,"" he said. Since January 2002, more than 750 people have been held. Many of the 305 prisoners at Guantánamo have complained of abuse and almost all have been confined for years without charges. Around 470 other prisoners have been released over the years, and the U.S. said it intends to try 60 to 80 of those currently in detention. Since 2002, just three prisoners have been formally charged, and only one has been convicted, as part of a plea bargain. David Hicks, an Australian citizen, who admitted to training with al-Qaeda, was repatriated to Australia to serve a nine-month prison sentence. The Supreme Court ruled against the Bush administration in two previous cases concerning the legal rights of the Guantánamo detainees. Congress got involved in the issue in 2006 and passed a law that was designed to keep detainee appeals out of the civilian court system and refer them instead to military commissions. But civil and legal rights groups say the alternative procedures set up by Congress and the Bush administration deprive the detainees of basic rights. ""At issue here that the Supreme Court decided was; 'Do we have a king in this country who is not bound by the rule of law and not bound by the Constitution? Or do we have a president that is subject to the Constitution?,"" said Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Conservative legal scholars argue against U.S. constitutional protections for foreign terrorist suspects. ""If the courts are going to be in charge of the conduct of warfare, we are going to be a much less safe country,"" said Andrew C. McCarthy, who is with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. A decision by the Supreme Court in the Guantánamo case is expected before the end of June."
politics,"On Thursday, May 26, Amnesty International urged foreign governments to investigate high-level U.S. government officials for human rights violations committed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. William Schulz, the executive director of the U.S. branch of Amnesty International, said that governments have an obligation under international law to conduct investigations into alleged human rights violations. Amnesty International released a list, which Schulz read in his speech: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, former CIA Director George Tenet, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, former commander of US forces in Iraq and current commander of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and Douglas Feith, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Schulz said: :""The refusal of the U.S. government to conduct a truly independent investigation into the abuses at Abu-Gharib and other detention centers is tantamount to a white-wash, if not a cover-up of these disgraceful events. It is a failure of leadership to prosecute only enlisted soldiers and a few officers while protecting those who designed a deliberate government policy of torture and authorized interrogation techniques that constitute torture or cruel and degrading human treatment. The government investigation must climb all the way to the top of the military and civilian chains of command. If the U.S. government continues to shirk their responsibility, Amnesty International calls on foreign governments to investigate senior U.S. officials. If those investigations support prosecution, the governments should arrest any official who enters their territory and begin legal proceedings against them,"" In 1998, General Pinochet of Chile was arrested in London after a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant. Schulz claims that similar measures could apply to members of the current U.S. administration such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld or Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan has described recent criticisms of the United States regarding alleged human rights abuses as ""unsupported by the facts."" President Bush, in a press conference on Tuesday, was asked about Amnesty International's report. The president said: ""I'm aware of the Amnesty International report, and it's absurd. It's an absurd allegation. The United States is a country that is &amp;mdash; promotes freedom around the world. When there's accusations made about certain actions by our people, they're fully investigated in a transparent way. It's just an absurd allegation. ""In terms of the detainees, we've had thousands of people detained. We've investigated every single complaint against the detainees. It seemed like to me they based some of their decisions on the word of &amp;mdash; and the allegations &amp;mdash; by people who were held in detention, people who hate America, people that had been trained in some instances to disassemble &amp;mdash; that means not tell the truth. And so it was an absurd report. It just is."""
politics,"United NationsThe director general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization is calling for more investment in agriculture in the developing world to tackle the problem of food insecurity. Jacques Diouf told Parliamentarians attending the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that more than one billion people are going hungry because of under-investment in agriculture during the past two decades. A recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Program finds most of the more than one billion hungry people in the world live in developing countries. It says no region is immune and hunger is expected to increase everywhere, even in the developed world. Jacques Diouf, Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, says 30 countries were in a situation of grave food crisis, requiring emergency assistance. He says 20 of them are in Africa and 10 in Asia and the Near East. ""The events of the last three years, triggered by soaring food prices and followed by the financial and economic turmoil, have demonstrated how fragile our global food system is. This year's increase in hunger is not the result of poor harvests or a shortfall in supplies, but rather is caused by the economic crisis which has reduced the incomes and job opportunities for the poor,"" he said. Diouf says under-investment in agriculture and rural development is one of the root causes of the recent global food crisis and the difficulties encountered by the majority of developing countries in dealing with it effectively. ""If people go hungry today it is not because the world is not producing enough food but because it is not produced in the countries where 70 percent of the world's poor live and whose livelihoods depend on farming activities. The challenge is not only to ensure food security for the one billion hungry people today, which is certainly an enormous task, but also to be able to feed a world population that is expected to reach 9.1 billion in 2050,"" he said. He has urged nations to increase food production by 70 percent by 2050, and remarked that ""Where there's a will, there's a way."" The FAO chief says studies show GDP growth originating in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as GDP growth originating in other sectors of the economy. He says the solution to food insecurity lies in boosting agricultural production and productivity in poor countries where food shortages are chronic. Diouf says production has to be increased in the most needy areas, by the most needy people. These are smallholder farmers in rural households. He says investment in agriculture in developing countries would amount to $44 billion in official development assistance a year. He says the returns from that investment in tackling world hunger would be enormous."
politics,"The IAEA board has passed a resolution to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council. The decision by the 35-nation board came on Saturday. The resolution was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, to finish preparing a report on Iran's civilian (and allegedly military) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. According to al-Jazeera, ElBaradei refused to accept pressure from Western states to finish his report in advance of the March 6 meeting. ElBaradei said in written responses to requests by the US and EU member states that he had given Iran until the meeting in March to answer questions to IAEA enquiries, stating, Due process, therefore, must take its course before we are able to submit a detailed report. ElBaradei also said that another IAEA verification mission was due in Iran shortly and that he had only in mid-January sent extra questions to Iran based on what diplomats called newly released intelligence. The text of the resolution, made without the results of the report, which will only be ready in March, requires ElBaradei to report to the Security Council ""steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions."" The resolution states that there are serious concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It also notes, ""Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations,"" (to the non-proliferation treaty) and expresses ""the absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes."" The resolution also states that Iran is to: * Re-establish a freeze on uranium enrichment and related activities; * Consider whether to stop construction of a heavy water reactor that could be the source of plutonium for weapons; * Formally ratify an agreement allowing the IAEA greater inspecting authority and continue honoring the agreement before it is ratified; and * Give the IAEA additional power in its investigation of Iran’s nuclear program, including ""access to individuals"" for interviews, as well as to documentation on its black-market nuclear purchases, equipment that could be used for nuclear and non-nuclear purposes and ""certain military-owned workshops"" where nuclear activities could take place The resolution calling for the referral was apparently drafted by several members states of the European Union together with the United States. Political analyst Joshua Frank claims that the US is not interested in diplomatic means of limiting Iran's possible shift towards nuclear weapons development and that the major reasons are Iran's oil supplies and plans to open an International Oil Bourse in petroeuros, which would challenge the petrodollar, on March 20, 2006. The agency vote sets the stage for future action by the top U.N. body. Russia and China insisted, in casting their votes with the majority, that future votes on deliberations should wait until at least March. The outcome could include economic and political sanctions. This process of successive escalation of the tension between Iran and the Western members of the Security Council was described by Hans Blix, responsible for about 700 inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as spin and momentum. He was in favour of inducing Iran to forego enrichment but also recommended that the United States give a similar commitment not to attack Iran with either conventional or nuclear weapons, just as it apparently has to North Korea. 27 of the 35 nations on the board voted for the referral. Three nations that voted against the resolution: Cuba, Syria and Venezuela. Five other countries Algeria, Belarus, Indonesia, Libya and South Africa, abstained. weapons of mass destruction in UK, Iran, Israel, and Iraq Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, a nuclear weapons state obliged under Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to destroy its own, existing nuclear weapons, said that the IAEA vote showed ""the international community's determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East."" After the decision, Iran said today that it would ""immediately"" begin the steps to ""restart full-scale uranium enrichment"" and ""curtail"" the powers of the IAEA inspectors. Javad Vaeedi, deputy Iranian nuclear negotiator, said in a press conference after the vote, ""After this decision, Iran has to immediately bring into force its parliamentary law to suspend voluntary implementation of (the watchdog agency's) Additional Protocol (on snap inspections) and (pursue) commercial-scale enrichment which until today was under full suspension."" He also said, ""this resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on legal or technical grounds."" Iran has also said that a proposed deal by Moscow to enrich Iranian uranium is dead. ""There is no adequate reason to pursue the Russian plan,"" said Vaeedi. ""Commercial scale uranium enrichment will be resumed in Natanz in accordance with the law passed by the parliament."" Iran had said that it will ""end cooperation with IAEA"", if referred to the Security Council. As of January 31, 2006, the Deputy Director General for Safeguards of the IAEA had reported that Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency, and to act as if the Additional Protocol is in force, including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations."

The chief of the Chadian military has said that the battle has ended with the rebels being ""entirely destroyed this column after 40 minutes of fighting,"" a claim which has been denied by the rebel groups. Timan Edrimi, one of the leaders made an opposing claim by saying that ""The army attacked us the rebels 40 kilometres from Massaguet, but we drove them back"" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said in a press release that ""a series of armed attacks on the UN refugee agency and other aid organisations has forced UNHCR to evacuate most of its staff from its office in Guereda in eastern Chad.""

According to AFP, the European Union force (EUFOR) has suspended all flights to Chad, although it was made clear that this was only a temporary delay. The commander of EUFOR in Chad said he did not consider a danger to EUFOR and he said that he would not consider it a danger ""unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians, or the non-governmental organisations, or UN personnel."""
politics,"United NationsThe United Nations (UN) suspended all of its operations in Gaza from yesterday, after the bombing of a convoy of UN aid trucks which killed one Palestinian driver, and wounded three others. Thursday was the second day of attacks on UN targets after three UN schools housing refugees were bombed on Tuesday, killing over 50 civilians. ""UNRWA decided to suspend all its operations in the Gaza Strip because of the increasing hostile actions against its premises and personnel,"" Adnan Abu Hasna, a Gaza-based spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said yesterday. Richard Miron, spokesman for the UN said that the Israeli military had been notified in advance of the coordinates of the relief trucks saying, ""This underlines the fundamental insecurity inside Gaza at a time when we are trying to address the dire humanitarian needs of the population there."" The bombing of the UN trucks was the last straw for the UN, already angered after Israeli tanks fired on a UN school housing refugees killing 50 including an entire family of seven young children. The UN said that they had given Israel the GPS coordinates of their schools, and demanded accountability for the attacks. Israel's government says it is investigating the incidents. More schools were attacked including the al-Fakhora School killing 40 people, many of them women and children. Hours before the attack on the al-Fakhora School was an attack on Asma Elementary School which killed three Palestinian cousins. The cousin's father said the bodies were so mangled he couldn't tell the bodies apart, ""We came to the school when the Israelis warned us to leave,"" he said. ""We hoped it would be safe. We were 20 in one room. We had no electricity, no blankets, no food. ""Suddenly we heard a bomb that shook the school. Windows smashed. Children started to scream. A relative came and told me one of my sons was killed. I found my son's body with his two cousins. They were cut into pieces by the shell."" Like al-Fakhora, Asma Elementary is an UNRWA school. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on yesterday that they were trying for four days to get their ambulances to a Gaza neighborhood before being allowed to by Israeli military forces. After getting there, they said, they found four starving children sitting next to the bodies of their dead mothers. ""This is a shocking incident,"" said Pierre Wettach, ICRC chief for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. ""The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestinian Red Crescent to assist the wounded."" Israel granted a three-hour ceasefire yesterday that they gave for aid workers to enter areas that they had closed off. 50 bodies were recovered during the ceasefire, raising the death toll to 763, including more than 200 children, since air raids first began on December 27. 3,121 people have also been wounded. Eight Israeli soldiers and three civilians have died in the same period. Israeli forces also shot a Palestinian man in the West Bank during a protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. Yesterday, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces after a confrontation in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Ma'ale Adumim near Jerusalem."
politics,"In Vienna, top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom, France, and Germany reached an agreement on Thursday on an incentive package to offer to Iran in exchange for its giving up uranium enrichment. The specifics of the incentive package were not revealed, but a delegation from Europe led by European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is expected to formally deliver the offer to Iran in the coming days. Iran would then have several weeks to respond. In a prepared statement, British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said, ""We have agreed on a set of far-reaching proposals as a basis for discussions with Iran. We believe they offer Iran the chance to reach a negotiated agreement based on cooperation."" Beckett did not mention any sanctions to be taken against Iran if it refuses to comply. The United Nations Security Council is expected to take up the question of sanctions should Iran turn down the offer. The agreement comes a day after the United States offered to participate in multilateral negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program if Iran suspends its uranium enrichment program. Iran agreed to the idea of holding talks but rejected the preconditions. In the first direct reaction by the Iranian government to the offer, Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Thursday; ""Iran welcomes dialogue under just conditions but won't give up our rights,"" Iranian state-run television reported. ""We won't negotiate about the Iranian nation's natural nuclear rights but we are prepared, within a defined, just framework and without any discrimination, to hold dialogue about common concerns,"" he said."
politics,"France and Italy have announced along with the United Kingdom that they will be sending military advisers to help Libyan rebels in their fight against the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Italian Minister for Defence Ignazio La Russa said Wednesday that his country will send ten instructors. French officials said they would send fewer than ten. The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said they would send a team that could possibly contain up to twenty advisers. La Russa said in a news conference that the advisers' roles had yet to be determined, ""They won't be on the battlefield. They'll be mentors, they won't accompany them. Training is one thing, participation another."" He further said of the rebels, ""They're rich in enthusiasm, they want to fight for liberty, but naturally they are poor in experience and arms."" However, La Russa believes that not all the arms the rebels have were taken from the Libyan Army stockpiles, stating, ""I don't think they only have arms from the Gaddafi army. Some help arrived."" He did not elaborate on the final statement. Meanwhile, U.S. officials say President Barack Obama's administration plans to give the Libyan opposition $25 million in non-lethal assistance. The officials say the assistance could include items such as vehicles, fuel trucks, protective vests and non-secure radios. itsdeadjim=x Libya's foreign minister, Abdul Ati al-Obeidi, criticized the dispatch of foreign military advisers, saying it will harm chances for peace in the country. In an interview with the BBC, Obeidi called for a ceasefire followed by a six month period to prepare for an election. ""We think any military presence is a step backwards, and we are sure that if this bombing stopped and there is a real ceasefire we could have a dialogue among all Libyans about what they want — democracy, political reform, constitution, election. This could not be done with what is going on now,"" said Obeidi. The move comes as UN officials condemn the use of cluster bombs that are in use by pro-Gaddaffi forces, a tactic banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, of which Libya is not a signatory. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated, amidst reports of snipers attacking civilians in many towns, that use of such munitions would ""inevitably lead to civilian casualties"", whilst also calling for NATO forces to ""exercise the utmost caution and vigilance so as not to kill civilians by mistake"". Pillay praised the Libyan government for allowing on Monday a U.N. humanitarian base in the capital city of Tripoli. Meanwhile, fighting has continued between rebel and pro-government forces this Wednesday in the besieged western port city of Misrata, where residents are pleading for international intervention.

Another with the group, Michael Christopher Brown also received shrapnel wounds which were not life-threatening. Hetherington last updated his Twitter account on Tuesday, which read, ""In besieged Libyan city of Misrata. Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces. No sign of NATO."" Leaders in the rebel-held city called for the urgent intervention of foreign ground troops to protect the 500,000 civilians there, the first such request by anyone among Libya's opposition forces.

politics,"Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International, compared the United States detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to a Soviet-era gulag in that it is ""entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law,"" she said. The group's Executive Director William Schulz, on Fox News Sunday, said in response to questioning that they do not ""know for sure"" whether or not testimonies it has published describing torture and abuse of prisoners by sections of the U.S. military are valid because the U.S. will not give access to the camp to investigate them. He also said he has no conclusive evidence that U.S. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, ordered torture of detainees at the facility. Schulz had previously referred to ""apparent high-level architects of torture,"", and included Donald Rumsfeld in that group. Director Schulz stated that comparing the installation to a gulag was perhaps not the best choice of words. ""...they (detainees) are not in forced labor, they are not being denied food. But,"" he continued,"" there are some analogies between the gulags and our detention facilities."" Schulz alleged that U.S. officials are ""running an archipelago of detention facilities,"" some secret. The report also describes ""ghost"" detainees who ""disappear"" and the export of prisoners to countries that are known to practice torture. During his appearance, Schulz argued that his and other human rights groups should be given broader access to the facility. ""We don't know for sure what all is happening at Guantanamo,"" he said, ""and our whole point is that the United States ought to allow independent human rights organizations to investigate."" The treatment of prisoners at the facility has been in hot dispute recently, with Amnesty International comparing the facility to a ""gulag"" in its annual human rights report. Bush administration officials condemned the comparison. On Friday, the U.S. government released documents indicating that both guards and detainees at the facility had on a few occasions abused the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book. Prisoners and ex-prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have testified that they have been tortured. David Hicks, still being held, filed an affidavit on August 5, 2004 declaring that he had been tortured, abused and ill-treated during his detention by US military authorities, and that he saw and heard similar treatment inflicted on other detainees. Mamdouh Habib, now free, says about his time at Guantanamo Bay that he was told by interrogators that his family had been killed, and that he was tied to the ground while a prostitute menstruated on him. Professor Christopher Tennant of Sydney University also stated he saw an unsigned medical report from Guantanamo Bay that backed up Habib's claim to have been beaten while in US custody; ""Well, the main feature of the medical report from Guantanamo was that he had had repeatedly blood in his urine, which is a very significant symptom and a worrying symptom, and that was consistent with his reports both to me and to the specialist physician who also examined him, and was consistent with the fact that, on examination, he had evidence of discolouration to his skin on his right loin, just over his kidney, which in turn was consistent with old bruising and possibly due to being beaten."""
politics,"itsdeadjim=1 The Chinese government released human rights activist Hu Jia from prison on Sunday after he had served over three years for subversion. His release, which had been scheduled in advance, occurred just days after controversial artist Ai Weiwei was unexpectedly released on bail after three months of detention. Hu was released on the same day that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began his visit to Britain, the first country on his three-nation Europe trade tour. Described by the Irish Times as a ""mild-mannered, slight figure who suffers from liver ailments"", the 37-year-old Hu is a prominent Chinese dissident who had spent years campaigning for civil liberties, environmentalism, and on behalf of suffers of HIV/AIDS before his imprisonment. He was imprisoned in April 2008 for ""inciting to subvert state power"" by writing articles about human rights in the period before the 2008 Olympic Games. He had also given many interviews to foreign news media and government embassies. He was first detained in December 2007 and his arrest came after he had spent more than 200 days under house arrest. In 2008 while in prison, he won the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, awarded by the European Parliament. Hu's wife Zeng Jinyuan said via Twitter that her husband lost his political rights upon his release and cannot speak to the media for a period of one year. source=Hu Jia, human rights activist Hu was briefly interviewed on Sunday via telephone by Hong Kong's Cable TV, and indicated that despite the danger, he would not give up his work. ""(My parents) have told me to just be a normal citizen and don't confront the system because this system is very cruel, using the country's absolute power to violate people's dignity without restraint. But I can only tell my parents I will be careful"", he said. Although recent releases of high-profile dissidents such as Hu and Ai may seem to some that China is loosening its repressive policies against dissidents, activists and academics said yesterday that the determination of the Chinese government to silence dissent has not lessened and those speaking up continue to be rounded up and detained. Huang Qi, a dissident released this month from prison and interviewed by telephone, said, ""We closely follow dozens of rights' defense cases, and I've found that that at the grassroots and lowest levels of society in China, the rights defense environment has not seen any fundamental improvements."" He warned, ""One cannot count how many ordinary people are being locked up or taken away every day."" However, Wan Yanhau who is a Chinese activist living in the US said there might be a short term diminishing of the crackdowns on human rights activists. He suggested the government could be realizing that the harsh treatment of dissidents has not stopped recent episodes of unrest. The riots by migrant workers in the Guangdong province and protests by ethnic Mongolians are recent examples. Further, China is receiving harsh criticism from European countries with which it wants to increase trade. But illegal detentions are increasing, according to Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, and are signs that China is not moving toward compliance with international norms."

The UN's special representative on sexual violence in conflict, Margot Wallstrom, said that the UN Security Council needs to ""punish the perpetrators in DR Congo"". Data collected by the UN shows that 200,000 cases of sexual assault have been reported in the last 14 years, 8,000 of which occurred last year and 1,244 of which occurred in the first three months of 2010. The UN's mission has been trying to combat the problem by escorting women when they go to market and working closely with the local officials. Wallstrom released a statement after returning from a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She said: ""Women have no rights, if those who violate their rights go unpunished. If women continue to suffer sexual violence, it is not because the law is inadequate to protect them, but because it is inadequately enforced. The Harvard Humanitarian Society issued a report in April showing that in South Kivu, an eastern province in DR Congo, 60% of the women raped were raped by armed men. More than half were raped in their own home, and more civilians are committing the attacks than ever before. Despite the country's war ending in 2003, DR Congo is still plagued with militia violence."

""The Sudanese government has shown total disregard for the wishes of the global, civilized community. I have no optimism as to the actions of the Sudanese government,"" Lantos said. Democratic House members James McGovern and John Olver of Massachusetts, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, and Jim Moran of Virginia were among the others arrested and released after paying $50 fines after being arrested in front of the Sudanese embassy. Olver said, ""We must hold the Sudanese government accountable for the attacks they have supported on their own citizens in Darfur.""

Farrow and White's testimonies contradict supermodel Naomi Campbell's testimony from last week. White said Campbell was ""mildly flirtatious"" with Taylor at a dinner in South Africa in 1997. Taylor, she alleged, told Campbell he would send her diamonds. White continued to say Campbell communicated with Taylor and awaited the diamond. Campbell was ""very excited"" about the diamonds according to White. ""Taylor's men came in and they sat down in the lounge and we sat opposite them... they then took out a quite scruffy paper and they handed it to Miss Campbell and said 'these are the diamonds.'"" Farrow claimed Campbell told her Taylor received diamonds in the middle of the night. She testified, ""Campbell said that in the night she had been awakened, some men were knocking at the door, and they had been sent by Charles Taylor, and they had given her a huge diamond."" Last week in Campbell's testimony, she did not know who sent her diamonds, but testified her then-agent White told her who probably sent the diamonds. White and Farrow testified Campbell said the diamonds were from Taylor. She claims she gave the diamonds to Jeremy Ractliffe who gave them to police. Police spokesperson Musa Zondi confirms Ractliffe had uncut diamonds. ""Yes, they are real diamonds. We cannot tell whether they are 'blood diamonds' or not. That will be part of the investigation,"" Zondi said. Taylor faces eleven counts for violating international law including, murder, rape, sexual slavery, enlistment of children under the age of fifteen, pillaging, enslavement, and ""outrages upon personal dignity."" Taylor allegedly traded ""blood diamonds"" for weapons and supplying the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Sierra Leone with weapons during the civil war from 1991 to 2002. This war conscripted child soldiers, an international crime. The prosecutors for the Special Court say Taylor trained the rebels and had them rape, murder, mutilate, and decapitate the civilians of Sierra Leone. Over 100,000 people died in the Sierra Leonean civil war. Taylor plead not guilty to all charges. Linking the blood diamonds, used to support the RUF, to Taylor is a high priority for the prosecution."

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon announced in November 2014 an inquiry would be made into ten incidents that took place in schools operated by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees. Aside from investigating Israeli strikes on seven of these institutions, the report also examines three cases in which Hamas-owned weaponry was hidden in such schools. Other than the summary, the full 207-page inquiry report is not to be made public. The inquiry was based on analysis of weaponry, medical reports, videos and still footage. In addition, the investigators relied on testimonies of UN employees and workers from other organizations in the Gaza strip. The investigation, led by former Dutch General Patrick Cammaert, is separate from the investigation led by the UN's Human Rights Council. Ban added on Monday that he assigned senior managers to consider the recommendations made by the investigators. Along with the publication of the report, Ban Ki Moon stated in a letter that the harm done to UN institutions that gave shelter to civilians is a ""matter of the utmost gravity"". According to UNWRA, the full report indicates that information regarding the humanitarian use of these schools had been transmitted continually to Israel during the conflict. Mr. Ban also wrote “I am dismayed that Palestinian militant groups would put United Nations schools at risk by using them to hide their arms.” UNRWA told the Guardian that although it sent the Israeli military the schools' GPS coordinates, in seven incidents examined by the investigation team the attacks were attributed to Israel. Furthermore, UNRWA has affirmed, as is coinciding with the investigation's conclusions, that the organization did not transfer arms to Hamas and had developed a mechanism to handle the existence of arms in its facilities with the help of international experts. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded regarding the issue, saying that ""Israel makes every effort to avoid harm to sensitive sites"" and that ""All of the incidents attributed by the report to Israel have already been subject to thorough examinations, and criminal investigations have been launched where relevant."" Hamas and the Palestinian Authority did not immediately respond."
politics,"Environment A 586-page report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Wednesday indicated governments should prepare for continued weather-related catastrophes. The report noted highly populated and very poor areas are at highest risk, and stressed no country or continent is safe from these ongoing threats. The panel consists of Nobel Prize-winners, whose work in climatology indicates more intense tropical cyclones. The report placed blame regarding recent disasters on a combination of climate change caused by humans, population changes and poverty. The panel was founded in 1988 by the United Nations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates recent severe weather conditions are costing upwards of US$80 billion per year. The report focused heavily on issues pertaining to coastal areas of the United States, specifically noting damage in those areas could increase 20 percent by 2030. The authors of the report stated some portions of India may become uninhabitable for floods and other problems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed out other cities at lesser risk, such as: Miami, Shanghai, Bangkok, China's Guangzhou, Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, Myanmar's Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon), and India's Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta). Inhabitants of small island nations may have to leave their homes because of elevated sea levels and major storms. A total of 220 authors worked on the report."
politics,"PhilippinesLeo Luna Mila, 35, a news anchorman and commentator of Radyo Natin, was gunned down Tuesday in San Roque, Northern Samar, Philippines. Mila was shot 12 times while leaving work. As publisher of the local magazine Peryodista and host of another radio program ""Bungkaras"" (Wake Up), he had been critical of the New People's Army's forced taxation. He had received threats through text messages last September. The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that Mila is the 8th journalist killed in the Philippines this year and the 62nd since 2001, when President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo came to power. A total of 122 media people have been murdered since President Cory Aquino overthrew the Marcos dictatorship in 1986. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice's Undersecretary Ricardo Blancaflor, chairman of the ""Task Force 211"" - Against Political Violence and Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in the Philippines, announced that a probe team would be sent to Northern Samar. The Northern Samar provincial police office has also formed ""Task Force Mila"" to investigate the killing. Two local politicians, including San Roque Mayor Andre Avalon, have offered a P100,000 (US$2 067.80) bounty for any information leading to the capture of the suspects. Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said, ""it is time for the central government, as well as local authorities, to promptly address the climate of impunity that is facilitating rising violence against Philippine journalists. Mila's murder is a reminder that police throughout the Philippines must respond immediately with investigations and protection when journalists are threatened for their work."""
politics,"The Government of Sudan has expressed that the Darfur Peace Accord with main rebel group, Sudan Liberation Army, led by Minni Menawi, can overturn the previous rejection of UN Peacekeepers. So far, only African Union Peacekeepers were allowed in Darfur. ""The Sudan government will be open for any assistance,"" Bakri Mulah, secretary-general for external affairs in Sudan's Information Ministry, said in Khartoum, Sudan. In New York, John R. Bolton, the US ambassador, on Saturday welcomed Khartoum's new willingness to accept a UN peacekeeping force to take over from AU soldiers in the Darfur region. He cited the Sudanese government representatives' comments to indicate they were now willing to accept the UN force. He said, "" We view this as a very encouraging sign, the first positive outcome from the Abuja peace agreement. "" In the meantime, top UN humanitarian official Jan Egeland has arrived in Sudan to review the situation in the Darfur region. He is expected to visit southern Darfur, where fighting has broken out recently. It is the first visit by a UN official to the region since the peace deal was signed. He said that access for aid workers in Darfur was at its worst level in two years. ""At the moment Darfur is slowly being strangled, it's dying in front of us, half of the population now has become war victims...so I believe, yes, we are turning the corner, but the whole world has to put pressure on the parties."" said Mr Egeland, the UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator. Earlier, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan requested Khartoum to issue visas to his team of assessors so they could plan for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to replace the 7,000 African Union troops later in the year. The AU troops, now running out of funds, had largely been ineffective in stopping atrocities, leaving millions to struggle in camps with little food or water. While details for a UN peacekeeping force are finalised, the US diplomat said the US had asked Rwanda to send in some 1,200 troops to supplement the AU forces. In a recent development, an unknown assailant shot a Spanish United Nations Aid worker in Chad. She is working in the eastern part of Chad to assist the refugees from Darfur region. 2,00,000 refugees have crossed the border to escape from the violence in Darfur. She is in critical condition."
politics,"Over 700 troops stormed a Haitian slum near the capital city of Port-au-Prince on Friday to oust a gang led by a man known only as Evans, blamed for many murders, kidnappings and rapes in the area. Heavy sustained gunfire was exchanged for several hours in the operation, which killed four gang members and wounded two U.N. peace keepers, U.N. officials said. U.N. commander Maj. Gen. Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz said no one was arrested in the raid and no weapons were recovered, but U.N. spokesman told BBC News that the operation had taken away the Evans' gang's base in Cite Soleil. The raid has been approved by Haitian President René Préval. Over 8,000 UN force have been stationed in Haiti since 2004, to restore order following a coup against then President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The area of Cité-Soleil is home to around 300,000 people and a neighborhood known as Boston was said to be in the control of Evan's gang. The UN troops raided a school controlled by Evans' gang and their headquarters, called Jamaica Base. This was the largest of the several raids into gang's territory."
politics,"War in South Ossetia (2008)The War in South Ossetia has escalated as Russian forces are being sent into the conflict on the Ossetian side. At 10:00 a.m. local time, Georgian sources reported that three Russian Su-24 attack aircraft invaded Georgian air space and dropped bombs onto a target near the town of Kareli. A later flight dropped one bomb near Gori. While no one was harmed in the second attack, seven people were reportedly injured by the first bombing. According to the Agence France-Presse, a speaker of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called this information ""nonsense"" and ""rubbish"". At 11:38 a.m. the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili announced the mobilization of reserve troops to withstand what he called ""a large-scale military aggression"" by Russia, and called Russia to stop the ""bombardment of Georgian towns."" Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin said that, ""it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the Olympic Games, the Georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in South Ossetia."" The crisis broke out after days of heavy fighting in the region. On August 7 Georgian troops launched an offensive against the Ossetian town of Tskhinvali, the separatist's capital. The Georgian government claims that this is in reaction to attacks by ""separatist rebels"" on ""unarmed civilians and peacekeeping forces"" in villages near the town. At the same time, the state news agency of South Ossetia reports that that Tskhinvali is under heavy artillery fire, with most or all of its population seeking shelter, and apparently a number of buildings already having been destroyed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) urged the two sides to set up a ""humanitarian corridor"" to evacuate civilians and the wounded. The main city hospital is reported not to be functioning, and ambulances can not reach the wounded. Thousands of refugees are leaving South Ossetia, mostly for North Ossetia, says the United Nations refugee agency. Georgian officials have claimed that up to four Russian jets have been shot down while attacking Georgia. Russia claimed ceasing all civilian aircraft flights to Georgia starting at midnight on August 9. In retaliatory response, Georgia is set to stop all Russian TV channels' broadcasts from August 9th onwards. According to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reporting at 9:21pm August 8th, a convoy of 20 vans carrying up to a total of 400 Russian volunteers has crossed from Russia's North Ossetia to South Ossetia. The government of South Ossetia has announced that it will evacuate children in danger zones to Russia. This came after a speech made by Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia, which accused the Georgian government of ""attempting to spark a full-scale war."" Kokoity said that the conflict's victim count has reached 1400. As of 10:51pm August 8th, 12 Russian peacemakers are reported dead and 150 wounded. A video tape showing Georgian Su-25 aircraft being downed was aired on Vesti Russian TV channel late night of August 8th. The pilot of the jet reportedly ejected, but was captured and killed on the ground by Ossetian military."
politics,"A thousand or more non-citizen residents of Kuwait demonstrated yesterday demanding rights given to Kuwaiti citizens. Police used water cannons in dispersing the protest. There were injuries among both protesters and police, and several protesters were detained. Citizens of Kuwait receive substantial welfare benefits, including education and health care. There are estimated to be around 100,000 non-citizen residents, called ""bidoons"" (from bedoun jinsiyya, Arabic meaning without nationality). Many bidoons claim descent from desert nomads who did not apply for citizenship in 1959. Many bidoons live in economic hardship, and cannot get legal recognitions such as birth and death certificates, driver's licenses, and attested marriage contracts. Interior Ministry spokesman Adil Al-Hashash said ""security forces on the ground talked to the protestors in a nice and civilized way"", telling them ""they should go to the legal channels for their demands rather than protesting."" The government says police acted in self-defense after protesters threw rocks. Independent Kuwaiti Member of Parliament Daifallah Buramia said ""the protest of bidoons is legitimate and the government is responsible for this because it has failed to resolve the problem""."
politics,"crime and law A suspected gunman has been taken into custody today after a university in Missouri, U.S. was locked down when he entered the campus with an AK-47 assault rifle. Cody Nathaniel Willcoxon reportedly arrived at Missouri University of Science and Technology around 9:00 a.m. CDT (14:00 UTC) Thursday morning after shooting at officers in a police chase. Officials say no one has been injured after Willcoxon&amp;mdash;described as a Caucasian male with sandy blonde hair&amp;mdash;entered McNutt Hall, a building on the campus. He had earlier escaped from police custody at Fort Leonard Wood while being questioned by military police when trying to enter the property and was then pursued by authorities along Interstate 44. The gunman began shooting at police while driving, exiting the interstate at Rolla, Missouri. Willcoxon reportedly stopped near a university building and fled on foot, before stealing a Ford Taurus from a residence near the school. No shots were fired on campus, say authorities, and no one was injured. The school sent emergency alerts to its students and faculty as a result of the incident. Law enforcement officials told students to stay inside their buildings until the lockdown was lifted and were not allowing anyone to enter the campus. Police were seen retrieving several items, including weapons, from a vehicle on the school campus. Willcoxon was apprehended by authorities around 1:00 p.m. CDT and the lockdown was subsequently lifted."
politics,"In the state of Connecticut today, a law allowing civil unions for same-sex couples took effect. The law is unique; it allows civil unions for same-sex couples with full benefits of a regular marriage, while at the same time defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Heterosexual couples are not allowed to receive civil unions. The license application will be identical to one for a regular marriage, except ""bride"" and ""groom"" are replaced with ""party 1"" and ""party 2."" The Connecticut civil unions law is the first gay marriage law to be passed voluntarily; lawsuits forced fellow New England states Vermont and Massachusetts to allow same-sex unions. Vermont has civil unions while Massachusetts allows actual same-sex marriage. Some localities have recognized same-sex couples in the form of a domestic partnership. ""This is a historic day. We're beyond ecstatic."" said Randy Sharp, 46, of Plainville, who was applying for a license with his partner Jeff Blanchette, 44. Not everyone is happy about the law. Already, opponents are lobbying for an amendment that will ban same-sex marriage. ""Today was a sad day for our state. It was a sad day for our state's children."" said Brian Brown, executive director of Family Institute of Connecticut. The group held a protest outside the Capitol which was attended by 50 people. Last year eleven states voted on Election Day to prohibit same-sex marriage."
politics,"A United Nations exhibition, entitled ""Lessons from Rwanda"", about the 1994 Rwanda genocide, has been dismantled and postponed because Turkey raised objections to the Armenian genocide being mentioned. The Armenian genocide was carried out by the so called Special Organization of the Young Turks, who specially elected criminals from Turkish prisons to act as escorts in the deportation of Armenians. The Armenian genocide is the second most studied case of genocide after the Holocaust Hitler himself occasionally referred to the extermination of the Armenians, or the lack of prosecution there of, in support for his plan to exterminate the Jews. However, the Republic of Turkey has long disputed that the event constituted genocide, claiming rather that the Armenian deaths were a result of inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during the turmoil of World War I. The exhibit was set up in the visitors lobby on Thursday and was due to be opened on Monday by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""Lessons from Rwanda"" was created by Aegis Trust, an anti-genocide NGO, and approved by the U.N. Department of Public Information. The Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia, East Timor and Sudan were mentioned as examples of genocide. But it also included a section entitled “What is genocide?” which read: Following World War One, during which 1 million Armenians were murdered in Turkey, Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin urged the League of Nations to recognize crimes of barbarity as international crimes. On Saturday, James Smith, the chief executive of Aegis, was told by the UN to remove the sentence. Aegis would not submit to the Secretary General’s request. Smith explains, ""Had we been asked to remove reference of atrocities to Jews because Germany objected, we would have been equally resistant."" The suggestion by Armen Martirosyan, the Armenian ambassador to the UN, to remove the words ""in Turkey"" were also not acceptable. Baki Ilkin, the Turkish ambassador to the UN, said that Turkey expressed ""discomfort over the text's making references to the Armenian issue and drawing parallels with the genocide in Rwanda."" On Monday, the panels in the visitor's lobby had been turned around to prevent it being seen by the public. Farhan Haq, U.N. associate spokesman, said that the review process which takes into account ""all positions"" had not been followed and that ""the exhibition has been postponed until the regular review process is completed."" Manoel de Almeida e Silva, an official in the strategic communications division, said the exhibit would take place. ""We are committed to it. It is a very important issue."""
politics,"Eluana Englaro, who had been in a persistent vegetative state since 1992 following an automobile accident, died Monday at the ""La Quiete"" clinic in Udine, where doctors stopped feeding her four days ago. The case has sparked a debate about euthanasia, as well as a political crisis. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, however, refusing treatment is not. On Friday doctors removed her feeding tubes in accordance with a November 2008 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Italy that it was within her father's rights to order the cessation of feeding. Eluana's father, Beppino Englaro, fought a ten-year battle to remove his daughter's feeding tubes. He and Eluana's friends testified that this would have been according to her own wishes. Beppino Englaro delivered the news of Eluana's death by telling ANSA: ""Yes, she has left us, but I don't want to say anything, I just want to be alone."" In an interview with The Guardian last week, Beppino Englaro said: ""If she couldn't be what she was before the 1992 accident then she would not have wanted to live."" In the last days of Eluana's life, the Italian government, led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, sought to intervene to save her life. The Vatican backed the government's position. At the time of her death, the Italian Senate was working on a law to force doctors to resume feeding Eluana. When her death was announced, the Senate held a moment of silence as a sign of respect. The legislation is continuing and could affect future right-to-die cases. Berlusconi said that he felt ""deep pain and regret"" for not saving her life. On Sunday, he said, ""I can guarantee on my honour and that of my ministers, that our decision was based on moral principles and there was never a plan to attack anybody."" Friday, Berlusconi had attempted to issue a decree to prevent the feeding tubes from being removed. This was however rejected by President Giorgio Napolitano who said it violated high court orders, triggering a constitutional crisis. Massimo D'Alema of the opposition party, Democratic Party of the Left, criticized the Prime Minister. ""Berlusconi has little knowledge of the constitutional culture,"" he said. ""He is a bully who wants to question the president's constitutional democratic powers."" source=Dr. Carlo Alberto Defanti The Italian Minister of Health Maurizio Sacconi attempted to halt the proceedings on a technicality. According to his office, the court had specified for Eluana Englaro to die in a hospice, which the ""La Quiete"" clinic technically is not. Eluana Englaro's long-time neurologist, Carlo Alberto Defanti, had erroneously predicted that she would survive another eight to ten days. ""Apart from her brain injuries, Eluana is a healthy woman. She has never been ill and never took antibiotics,"" said Dr. Defanti on Sunday. ""It was something we did not foresee,"" he said of her death on Monday. Defanti said he did ""the right thing... I am helping a person achieve her own wish, a defenseless person who was betrayed by everyone except her father and a few other people."" Professor Antonio de Monte, an anesthesiologist who also provided care for her said: ""Eluana died 17 years ago."" At Sunday's noon blessing, Pope Benedict XVI said, without direct reference to the case, ""Let us pray for all the sick, especially those most seriously ill, who cannot in any way provide for themselves, but are totally dependent on the care of others. Let each of them experience, in the care of those who are near them, the power of God's love and the wealth of his saving grace."" According to The Times, opinion polls showed the people of Italy to be evenly divided 47/47, with 6 percent undecided, on the issue. Beppino Englaro and observers have called Eluana ""Italy’s Terri Schiavo"" in reference to the United States Terri Schiavo case in 2005, which resulted in Terri, who was also in a vegetative state, being allowed to die after attempted legislative intervention."
politics,"Chinese premier Wen Jiabao paid a visit to the birthplace of English playwright and poet William Shakespeare on Sunday. The visit to Stratford-upon-Avon was included in his three-day tour of various industries in Britain. The UK is one of China's biggest trading partners, second only to the EU. source=Premier Wen Jiabao The 68-year-old Wen, reportedly a fan of Shakespeare, was met upon his arrival at Stratford-upon-Avon by dozens of flag-waving individuals from the UK's Chinese community. He visited Shakespeare's birthplace, which is now a museum and then attended a scene from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"", his favourite play, while sitting in the ""sun-drenched"" garden. He toured the collection of treasures at the town's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. On his tour at the Trust, lasting half an hour longer than planned, he looked through a 17th-century folio of Shakespeare's famous plays. Trust director Diana Owen, who talked with Wen during his informal tour, said Wen described Shakespeare as ""the greatest writer of all time."" Wen told Sky News that his love of Shakespeare began as a child. ""The local people here have every reason to take pride that this place has produced a figure who belongs not only to the UK but to the world,"" Mr Wen said to Sky News. ""A great man who belongs not just to his era but to entire history."" The Chinese leader's arrival in England came days after the announcement of activist and dissident sculptor Ai Weiwei's release by Beijing last Wednesday, after a global call for his release. The announcement, made before Wen's meeting today with British Prime Minister David Cameron, was likely discussed along with the issue of China's record on human rights and trade deals. There were several protesters outside Downing Street, who held a banner that read ""Cameron and Wen: human rights before trade"". The goal of the visit, part of a three-nation tour of Europe, is the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries. China is increasingly outsourcing its own manufacturing to less costly labour markets and wants to increase its investments in established European brands. Today, China and Britain announced contracts worth over one billion pounds. source=Jeremy Hunt, British Culture Secretary British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, whose wife is Chinese, was hopeful that Wen's visit would have a positive effect on the country's tourism industry. He told Sky News, ""I am hoping that a billion Chinese might see some pictures on their TV of their premier coming and visiting the birthplace of Shakespeare, and thinking: 'Well, I'd like to go there as well.' "" Hunt noted that 150,000 Chinese visit the UK yearly and thinks that is ""the tip of the iceberg"". Hunt stressed that Wen's visit is not only about jobs. It is also about developing broader cultural ties ""which is the best possible way to make sure we understand each other and avoid the kind of misunderstanding that so can bedevil relationships, as has happened in the past,"" he told the BBC. The Chinese are interested in British happenings. About 30 million Chinese watched the recent Royal wedding."
politics,"Australia Ballarat, Australia — In the lead-up to the upcoming Australian federal election, four candidates for the Division of Ballarat met last Sunday at the Ballarat Tech School in a climate-centred forum organised by local group Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions (BREAZE). In attendance were sitting Labor member Catherine King, Greens candidate and former mayor John Barnes, Australian Federation Party candidate Kerryn Sedgman, and independent candidate Alex Graham. Local Liberal and Liberal Democrats candidates gave apologies in place of attendance. The event was preceded by a climate action rally outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and the Ballarat Town Hall, which featured speeches from both representatives of BREAZE, the Ballarat branch of Extinction Rebellion, Environment Victoria, the Public Transport Users Association, and the Ballarat Trades Hall. The forum began with each candidate being given three minutes to summarise their policies on climate before questions were taken from members of the public. John Barnes, the Greens candidate, began by claiming ""the Greens have the most ambitious program of any of the parties on addressing climate change"", and said if the Greens were in the balance of power in the coming election, they would work to push Labor towards the ""reforming zeal of past generations"", invoking former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Barnes stated the Greens have a target of 75% emissions reduction by 2030, by which time they would also end the mining, burning, and export of coal in Australia. Independent candidate Alex Graham began his speech by saying he was ""passionate about our environment"" and claimed to have ""absolutely, without question, the best policy"", explaining the focus of his candidacy was to introduce a referendum that would allow the Australian government to ""write its own money supply into existence"". Graham said this policy would deliver ""money beyond the pale to totally restore our environment"". Incumbent MP Catherine King said that in her twenty years as an MP, the Australian Parliament had been unable to deal with the climate issue. She referenced previous attempts by the last Labor government to legislate policies to tackle climate change, such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), but stated these efforts were ""completely and utterly dismantled"" after the 2013 election. King referred to the Powering Australia policy announced in December 2021 by Labor energy and climate spokesperson Chris Bowen, stating the policy had been supported by the Business Council of Australia (BCA), National Farmers' Federation (NFF) and ""some"" environmental groups. King stated the policy included a commitment to 43% emissions reduction by 2030, net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and it would overall ""grow jobs, increase renewable energy, and bring emissions down"". Kerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party promised to centre the opinions of views of the community, and read from the Federation policy on climate directly, saying ""carbon is not the enemy. Toxic pesticides are the true enemy."" Sedgman claimed pesticides were the primary source of nitrous oxide (N₂O) released, and that N₂O was ""300 times worse than carbon"". After the candidates concluded with their opening summaries, members of the public were open to ask questions. The first question asked candidates what their first two priorities were for climate action. Barnes said the Greens' top priority was ""prompt action"", and they would also focus on transforming the nation's economy to ""a new way — a new sustainable way — of making our living in the world"". Graham stated if Australia had a limitless supply of money, there would not be a climate change issue and Australia would become a model for the world. He said his two priorities would be creating more money and introducing newer technologies. King said her first priority would be getting more renewables into the grid and generally increasing the amount of renewables, and also added a third priority, saying that as Minister for Transport and Infrastructure in a Labor government, she would add a climate section to the department and work to create a network of electric vehicle charging stations. Sedgman stated ""there's more than two top priorities"", but remarked that soil regeneration was a key part of carbon sequestration, and called for a more immediate approach to deal with climate through education and community hubs. The event was then disturbed slightly by a person asking about a supposed ""ninety-year suppression order suppressing the names of twenty-eight VIP alleged paedophiles"", who was asked to leave by organisers for disrupting the event. King labeled the belief a ""QAnon conspiracy theory"". After this, the topic shifted to the proposed Western Victorian Transmission Network, a proposed overhead transmission line from Bulgana to Sydenham. Graham said his proposed referendum, if successful, could lead to the federal government subsidising a plan to put the transmission line underground beneath the Western Highway, emphasising we shouldn't ""let money interfere with saving this planet"". King noted the location of a proposed transfer station was ""really problematic"", but stated the issue lay more with the regulatory process, and Labor would work with state and territory governments to reform this process. Sedgman admitted she was not fully aware of some of the background King had bought up, and she would like to speak to those affected personally. Barnes said the consultation of AusNet, who propose building the transmission line, had not been good, and hopes an extended time granted for the environmental impact statement will allow all people affected to be properly heard. Barnes also stated AusNet had claimed diverting the line underground would cost thirteen times more than the overhead alternative, while a Shire of Moorabool study showed it would only cost five times more. One questioner asked about what the candidates would do to investigate the possibility of direct air capture. Barnes remarked ""the best way to sequester carbon is not to release it in the first place"", and said the mechanical removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was ""probably a pipe dream"". Graham quipped he was ""prepared to ask my friend if he could do it, and I'm sure he could."" King argued the technology was ""a fair way off yet"", but noted A$3 billion was reserved in Labor's Powering Australia plan for new technologies to reduce emissions. Sedgman stressed the importance of reducing the ""extraordinary rate"" at which deforestation occurs. Candidates were then asked if they would commit to no new coal and gas infrastructure. King confirmed a moratorium on new coal and gas was not part of Labor policy, but they were not interested in investing taxpayer funds towards them, contrasting it with what she said was the current government's approach to projects such as the Collinsville Power Station. Graham said, as someone who had previously worked in the industry, he would ""close down every coal-fired power station as soon as it was possible"" and disallow the construction of new coal-fired power stations. Graham also pledged to close down coal mines and ban fracking. Barnes stated the Greens take the advice of the International Energy Agency seriously, and would not allow any new coal, gas, or oil projects, as well as closing down coal-fired power stations by 2030, to be replaced by renewable energy. Barnes emphasised the need to lower emissions before 1.5 °C of global warming was reached. One questioner asked candidates what they would do in the event of two scenarios after the coming election — one being that Labor had a clear majority, the other that the Greens held the balance of power. King stated the ""beauty of power in Australia"" was it didn't require any legislation. However, she said Labor would still attempt to legislate targets of 43% emissions reduction and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Barnes reiterated the Greens in the balance of power would push Labor to be more ambitious, and that while compromise would be needed in a hung parliament, the Greens would ""play hardball"" on addressing the climate. Candidates were then asked about a proposal from Beyond Zero Emissions to turn northern Australia into the ""battery of Asia"". Barnes stated Australia could become a ""energy superpower"", and good government policy could have the market ""with us"" on this issue. King declared over 600,000 jobs could be realised under Labor's Powering Australia plan, and concurred in saying Australia should be a renewable energy superpower and exporting technology to the world. She highlighted the need for a government that ""believes in climate change, believes that we have to do something about it"", and restated that Labor's plan was endorsed by the BCA and NFF. The final question asked how those in coal communities such as the Hunter Valley could be helped to deal with the potential loss of jobs with a transition to renewable energy. Graham responded by calling for a ""basic, living universal wage to all people"", while Sedgman asked who was eligible to have these jobs in the first place ""due to the current mandate conditions"". King said the demand for fossil fuels was running out, with trading partners setting targets of net zero emissions by 2050. She underlined the ""really good jobs in renewables"", and emphasised the need to start now in training people for new, good-paying renewable jobs, as otherwise these workers wouldn't get jobs again. Barnes stated the Greens had announced A$19 billion over ten years with the aim of transitioning communities affected by a move away from fossil fuels, they would aim for renewables running the power system by 2030, and they would run retraining programs and maintain existing incomes for ""up to a decade"" if workers cannot find ""equally lucrative"" jobs. Barnes emphasised the need to not vilify those working in mining communities, and a plan must be in place for these communities to maintain their dignity. The forum concluded with representatives from Environment Victoria in the local area invited to present copies of an open letter calling for ""faster and fairer climate action"", and which was signed by 125 people. Among other things, the letter called for a replacement of ""coal, oil and gas with clean energy"", ""a national plan to slash climate pollution this decade with strong targets that, at a minimum, match our trading partners"", and an accelerated rollout of renewable energy projects with the aim of creating ""a healthy, prosperous economy while ceasing new energy generating projects from fossil fuel sources""."
politics,"In a meeting on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia, the United Church of Christ overwhelmingly approved a resolution supporting same-sex marriage, therefore becoming the largest Christian denomination to do so. UCC has over 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members. In a press conference, Rev. John H. Thomas said, ""On this July Fourth the General Synod of the United Church of Christ has acted courageously to declare freedom, affirming marriage equality, affirming the civil rights of same gender couples to have their relationships recognized as marriages by the state, and encouraging our local churches to celebrate and bless those marriages."" Thomas also acknowledged that the issue of marriage equality is ""the source of great conflict"" not only in society but also in the churches. The UCC, he said, ""is no exception"" and ""there are clearly great differences among our own members over this."" The decision is non-binding but asks member churches to consider wedding policies ""that do not discriminate against couples based on gender"" and support laws granting equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians. Some member churches have suggested they may leave the denomination but most members appeared to support the resolution noting some ministers already perform same-sex ceremonies. UCC was criticized last year for creating a television commercial including a gay couple being excluded from a church. The 30-second ad was rejected by most TV networks."
politics,"Saudi Arabia On Thursday, Hatice Cengiz, fiancée of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, addressed reporters in New York, New York, calling for the killers of Khashoggi to be brought to justice. Cengiz traveled to New York for the United Nations (UN) General Assembly which took place this week. Khashoggi was murdered last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Hatice Cengiz is a Turkish national now living in London. USDOS The previous day, television broadcaster PBS revealed that in December, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia accepted responsibility for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but did not say he'd ordered it. Speaking to Martin Smith of PBS, he said, ""It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch."" The official position remained that rogue operatives within the Saudi government committed the murder. According to Reuters and NBC, Mohammad bin Salman is the de facto Saudi ruler. Cengiz called Mohammad's admission a ""political maneuver."" She explained, ""By confessing this, he's also distancing himself from the killing of Jamal ... He's saying that it happened under his watch but he means he is not involved in this crime."" She credited news media with keeping the story alive. Speaking to NBC News, she said, ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet ... But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad"". ""What is so sad for me"", Cengiz said, ""is not seeing the punishment of the perpetrators ... Imagine that the entire world remains silent over Jamal's killing. This silence and inertia created huge disappointment on my side."" Agnès Callamard, a UN rapporteur for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights who had investigated the case, cautioned justice does not come swiftly. ""True justice takes time and I know it's painful, but that's the reality of the world we live in,"" she said, asking Cengiz to be ""patient and resilient."" The CIA and other intelligence agencies reportedly believe the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing. Callamard encouraged the CIA to release the files from their investigation. A closed-door trial is underway in Saudi Arabia in which eleven individuals have been charged with the murder, however Callamard did not give it any credence. Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national, was a columnist for The Washington Post, and he lived in self-imposed exile in Virginia as a legal resident of the United States. He entered the consulate in Istanbul on October 2 2018, seeking documents allowing him to marry Turkish national Hatice Cengiz. He never came out. Saudi Arabia initially denied all claims that Khashoggi was slain, however, a UN report eventually concluded evidence supported his murder and dismemberment inside the consulate by Saudi agents. To date, his remains had not been recovered."
politics,"2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict The United Nations Security Council has unanimously approved Resolution 1701 calling for a ""full cessation of hostilities"" in the Israeli-Lebanon war and for international and Lebanese troops to replace Israeli troops in south Lebanon. The UN decree comes on the heels of an Israeli government decision to expand its offensive in Lebanon. Sources say that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert will bring the UN resolution to cabinet for discussion on Sunday. Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said that his government was likely to agree to the resolution. ""I do not want to preempt the Cabinet decision, but the language as I see it now &amp;mdash; and I'm being careful &amp;mdash; if the language of the resolution doesn't change, I view this resolution very positively and, of course, the crux is implementation,"" Ayalon said. ""If this resolution will be enforced, then we solve the problem of Lebanon,"" said the Israeli envoy. Hezbollah officials have not responded to the UN action. The Lebanese cabinet meets Saturday to discuss the resolution. Lebanese leaders have cautiously welcomed the resolution which had been delayed for almost a week due to negotiations over its wording. U.N. Ambassador Nouhad Mahmoud of Lebanon said; ""The Lebanese are not comfortable with the Israeli distinctions of what is defensive and what is offensive."" The resolution calls for Hezbollah to end its attacks on Israel and for Israel to end ""offensive military operations"" in Lebanon. It also raises the strength of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, the United Nations Interim Force (Unifil), from 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000, and gives it an expanded mandate to enforce the ceasefire. A portion of the UN language expanding that force's Chapter 6 mandate reads: ""Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes Unifil to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind... "" The U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, responding on Friday during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer to the difference between a UN Chapter 7 mandate, and the current mandate for Unifil in Lebanon said: So this force has a big mandate, it has a robust mandate, it has a mandate that will allow it to defend itself and to defend that mandate. But it's never been the expectation that this force is going to disarm Hezbollah. That will have to be done by the Lebanese......Chapter 7 is very often used when a government is not prepared to accept a force. Lebanon is prepared to accept this force, but this is an absolutely robust mandate. This, by the way, is what helped the Israeli government. They were concerned earlier about the mandate. After we talked about this enhanced mandate in the revised resolution, I think the government of Israel saw that it met their needs. Israel is to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon as UN and Lebanese troops are deployed. The resolution outlines plans for the disarmament of Hezbollah and for a settlement of the Israeli-Lebanese border. The UN also called for the unconditional release by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers it captured on July 12th, precipitating the conflict. 123 Israelis, including 40 civilians, and 861 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 31-day old war."
politics,"North Korea nuclear programKim Myong Gil, the North Korean minister to the United Nations in New York City, New York, claims his government has shut down its infamous reactor located in Yongbyon and is ready to start dismantling its nuclear programmes as long as the United States keeps its promise to remove all sanctions and remove North Korea from the terrorism list. The 10 members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team will be going to North Korea to verify the shut down has taken place. The inspectors were forced to leave North Korea in late 2002 when this crisis began. The South Korean government has sent the North 50,000 tons of fuel oil as a reward for starting to dismantle its nuclear programmes and will send one million tons more. The South Korea's nuclear envoy Chun Yung-woo called the shut down of the Yongbyon a milestone event but said the next phase will be more difficult than the reactor shut down."
politics,"Sri LankaFrench newspaper Le Monde published on Friday an article accusing the United Nations (UN) of deliberately hiding facts about civilian killings during the last months of the civil war in Sri Lanka in order to protect their own activities in the country. According to investigative journalism by Le Monde, The UN did not publish the number of civilians killed until it was finally leaked. According to a UN confidential report, formatnum:7720 people were killed (among them formatnum:678 children) and formatnum:18465 were injured (among them formatnum:2384 children) between January 20 and May 13. A UN official declared to Le Monde that his hierarchy tried to suppress these figures to remain in good terms with the government. When these numbers were leaked, Neil Buhne, the UN official coordinator in Sri Lanka, asked to be the only recipient of the figures in the future. Even the secretary general Ban Ki-moon tried to hide the numbers, according to Le Monde. Despite the heavy bombings in the last days of the war, the formatnum:7720 dead people are still given as an official figure which was repeated in The New York Times. According to Vijay K. Nambiar, Ban Ki-moon's chief-of-staff cited by Le Monde, the numbers could be closer to formatnum:20000; these figures are corroborated by The Times. The paper discovered compelling evidence showing that on average 1,000 Sri Lankan civilians perished each day during the first 19 days of May. ""These figures are not even complete yet. It’s going to end up way more"" said a UN source. The Times relied on aerial photographs, confidential UN documents, witnesses and independent defense experts to understand the final days in the 26 year old Sri Lankan civil war. formatnum:200000 survivors are interned in the Manik Farm refugee camp. The camp was visited twice by The Times investigators. formatnum:3000 wounded civilians are still missing from the last known makeshift hospital. A survivor reported hospitals were bombed by the government which claimed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were using them as hideouts. “They didn’t want anyone left to say what had happened,” say UN sources. “We reject all these allegations. Civilians have not been killed by government shelling at all. If civilians have been killed, then that is because of the actions of the LTTE rebels who were shooting and killing people when they tried to escape.” said a representative for the Sri Lankan High Commission. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara of Sri Lanka added ""We have not used any shelling or mortaring, only small arms. We know how we are fighting"". The aerial images taken by The Times suggest the contrary. Le Monde also wrote that the United Nations did not help its people on the ground. Text messages sent by local employees in the war zones asked to ""stop the war"" and ""what is the international community doing"". ""Hundreds of people trying to flew where caught by local dictators and beaten, without distinction of age and sex. I hear them crying."" said another one. In April, Vijay Nambiar asked the locals to keep a ""low profile"" and play an active role in supporting the government. The Sri Lankan government denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland cleared Sri Lanka of any alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka gained the support of China, Egypt, India and Cuba."

On Thursday evening, the Iranian Embassy in London released a second letter purported to be written by detained servicewoman Faye Turney. The footage was released hours after Iran criticized yesterday's United Nations Security Council statement, which voiced “grave concern” over the incident and called for an ""early resolution"" of the matter. 4=Spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair In the video footage, three crewmen are shown with one identified as Nathan Thomas Summers. Summers was seen confessing to being in Iranian waters and apologizing to the Iranian people. ""We trespassed without permission,"" said Summers. ""Since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly. We have not been harmed at all."" ""I would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ... I deeply apologize,"" continued Summers. ""They have looked after us really well."" According to the BBC, the UK Foreign Office described the latest video as ""disgraceful exploitation"". A hand-written note, the second letter apparently written by Faye Turney, was released by Iran on Thursday evening. The letter requests the UK government to withdraw its troops from Iraq. ""Isn't it time for us to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let them determine their own future,"" the letter states. In reply, a Prime Minister's office spokesman said: ""It is wrong. It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover this. It is wrong in terms of basic humanity"". Iran has also released a third letter purporting to be from Leading Seaman Turney, addressed to the ""British People"". The letter states that she has been ""sacrificed due to the intervening policies of the Bush and Blair governments"" and repeats the call for the withdrawal of British and US forces from Iraq. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in response: ""I really don't know why the Iranian regime keep doing this. All it does is enhance people's sense of disgust at captured personnel being paraded and manipulated in this way."" The BBC says it has been able to confirm the names of six of the 15 sailors and marines held by Iran. Apart from Leading Seaman Turney and Seaman Summers (from Shropshire and Cornwall respectively), they are: Paul Barton from Southport, Danny Masterton from Ayrshire, Joe Tindall from south London and Adam Sperry from Leicester. On March 23, the fifteen sailors and marines from the frigate HMS Cornwall had been inspecting a ship, in what the UK identified as Iraqi waters, when they were surrounded by Iranian gunboats and taken into Iranian custody. Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, and are still detaining the fifteen. The video, retransmitted by BBC (link to Youtube) Transcript"
politics,"Politics and conflicts On Sunday, United States and South Korean envoys met in Seoul, South Korea to discuss ways to reopen diplomatic talks with North Korea and sending humanitarian aid there. Earlier, the United Nations warned the country faces starvation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Envoys also discussed a Southern proposal to formally end the Korean War, which was not closed since the last Armistice Talks in July 1953. Prior to the meeting, Sung Kim, US Special Envoy for North Korea told reporters after arriving in Seoul to meet South Korean nuclear envoy Noh Kyu-duk that he looked forward to ""productive follow up discussions"" after their meeting in Washington, D.C. last Tuesday. ​Their agenda for Sunday included the denuclearization of North Korea, declaring a formal end to the Korean War and sending humanitarian aid to North Korea as a way to reopen diplomatic talks. After the meeting, Kim said the US calls ""on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) to cease… destabilizing activities, and instead, engage in dialogue."" He reiterated the US ""remains ready to meet with the DPRK without preconditions"", and had ""made clear that the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK."" During a press conference Friday, United Nations Special Rapporteur on North Korea Tomas Ojea Quintana said the country may need humanitarian aid and called for easing sanctions against the North Korean textile and seafood sectors. He warned that continued border closures and limited trade might lead to starvation, and that the region is ""veering towards an arms race"". During a US Department of State press briefing the same day, spokesperson Ned Price said ""UN Security Council resolutions regarding the DPRK remain in effect"" and ""we are involved in efforts to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the neediest"" in North Korea. Last Tuesday, North Korea tested a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). In response, special envoy Kim called on the North to ""refrain from further provocations and engage in sustained and substantive dialogue"". The North's responded the US was ""overreacting"". South Korea launched a new SLBM on September 15, while North Korea launched a hypersonic missile, in early stages of development, on September 28."

He was known for his role as co-chairman of the multi-party talks to resolve the conflicts in Northern Ireland. His efforts helped form the Good Friday agreement. Holkeri also served as U.N. General Assembly president and as a special representative to Kosovo. After serving as Prime Minister of Finland from 1987 until 1991 and unsuccessfully running for President in 1982 and 1988, Holkeri focused his attention outside of Finland. He co-chaired the Northern Ireland talks with former US Senator George Mitchell and retired Canadian General John de Chastelain, and honoured with a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II after the Good Friday agreement was made. Northern Irish politician and leader of Sinn Féin Gerry Adams said ""Harri Holkeri enjoyed a distinguished career as prime minister of Finland, and in several prominent UN roles, including in Kosovo. But it will be for his work here alongside George Mitchell in co-chairing the talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement for which he will be most remembered internationally."" Current Prime Minister of Finland, Jyrki Katainen said ""Holkeri ... was the person who was able to build the confidence of people in difficult situations. This was one of the important personal characteristics that helped him achieve results in important international roles."" In 2003 he became the U.N special representative to Kosovo but resigned less than a year later due to ill health. He was badly injured in 2008 after he was knocked to the ground by a thief escaping from a store. He is survived by his wife, two children and six grandchildren."
politics,"LGBT Of 400,000 serving members of the United States military and their families surveyed, most do not believe reform of the rules on gays and lesbians serving in the military would affect morale, unit cohesion or military effectiveness. A survey conducted by The Pentagon has concluded only 30% believed that changing the law would have a negative effect. The report also noted that those who have served with people they know or suspect to be gay have found unit cohesion to not be a problem. The report was produced by Jeh C. Johnson, chief counsel at the Pentagon, and General Carter F. Ham, an U.S. Army commander in Europe. Opposition to reform was highest amongst troops in combat units and among members of the United States Marine Corps, where 40% and 46% oppose changes to the policy respectively. Robert Gates, the defence secretary, has stated that the survey shows that reform ""would not be the wrenching, traumatic change many had feared"" and asked the Senate to support an end to the current policy. The current policy&amp;mdash;often referred to as ""don't ask, don't tell""&amp;mdash;was passed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and has led to the discharge of over 13,000 troops since 1994. A 2006 study by the University of California estimated that the cost of enforcing the policy is approximately $363 million, including the value of military training that is lost when a member of the armed services is sent home. Most other Western nations allow gay people to serve openly in the military. Democratic leaders including President Barack Obama support repeal and hope to pass it before the Christmas break. Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain believes that more scrutiny is needed before repeal during war-time. The authors of the report believe otherwise, stating that they ""do not underestimate the challenges in implementing a change in the law, but neither should we underestimate the ability of our extraordinarily dedicated service men and women to adapt to such change and continue to provide our nation with the military capability to accomplish any mission."""

According to the U.N., there has been an increase in the use of intimidation methods by elements of the national security forces loyal to incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo. ""The international community must act and act decisively. I emphasize again today what I have said earlier: any attempt to starve the United Nations mission into submission will not be tolerated.

He added that the techniques of intimidation include ""abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation."" Meanwhile, the French government urged its citizens to leave the country. ""We ask those who can, to leave Ivory Coast temporarily until the situation normalises,"" said Francois Baroin, a government spokesperson. On Saturday, Gbagbo ordered the U.N. and French peacekeepers to leave the country saying, ""The government demands the departure of the UNOCI and LICORNE French forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate."" Gbagbo claimed victory in the nation's elections on November 28. Alassane Ouattara won the presidential run-off election on December 3 according to the country's electoral commission. However, the Constitutional Council has contested the announcement. The French government and the U.N. have also rejected the election results. Gbagbo offered for several entities to investigate the election results, which was rejected by Ouattara who said ""we've finished with these games.""

In the intervening election, the victorious Conservatives promised that if they were elected parliament would hold a free vote on whether to amend or repeal the Act. Several surveys have suggested that MPs in the minority parliament will overwhelmingly reaffirm support for same-sex marriage once a vote has held. The pro-same sex marriage group Canadians for Equal Marriage estimates that the motion will be defeated by at least 35 votes. This has prompted supporters of same-sex marriage to urge that a vote be held as soon as possible while opponents of gay marriage have been urging the government to delay the vote until the next election, expected early in 2007, in hopes of the election of a Conservative majority that would repeal the act. A number of Conservative MPs and strategists have supported an early vote, however, in the belief that the same-sex issue would hurt the Tories in an election campaign by emphasizing a social conservative agenda that is unpopular in urban areas and Quebec."

Convention Against Torture, which prohibits, of course, cruel and inhumane and degrading treatment, those obligations extend to US personnel wherever they are, whether they are in the United States or outside the United States,"" said Rice, speaking from the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on Wednesday. Media reports and Human Rights groups have alleged that the CIA transported renditioned prisoners through European countries, which could violate European laws and the sovereignty of countries involved. Secretary Rice claimed that the United States has respected the sovereignty of other countries, and that it has not transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture, and has not transported anyone to a country when we believe he will be tortured. ""We consider the captured members of Al-Qaeda and its affiliates to be unlawful combatants who may be held, in accordance with the law of war, to keep them from killing innocents. We must treat them in accordance with our laws, which reflect the values of the American people. We must question them to gather potentially significant, life-saving, intelligence. We must bring terrorists to justice wherever possible,"" Rice told reporters before she left from Andrews Air Force base on Monday. Rice said that European nations should realize that interrogations of terrorist suspects have produced information that has saved European lives. However, Secretary Rice provided no specific cases. ""Secretary Rice made extra-legal rendition sound like just another form of extradition. In fact, it's a form of kidnapping and 'disappearing' someone entirely outside the law,"" said Tom Malinowski, a Human Rights Watch official in Washington.

United States President George W. Bush has thanked the Chinese government for assisting and persuading North Korea to return to the talks. He went on to say that ""the US will be sending teams to the region to work with our partners to make sure that the current United Nations Security Council resolution is enforced but also make sure the talks are effective, that we achieve the result we want"". Pyongyang did not make the lifting of the sanctions a condition for the resumption of the talks. The negotiations between the six parties, North Korea, China, the United States of America, South Korea, Russia, and Japan, could restart as early as November, said Christopher R. Hill, the chief US negotiator on North Korea. South Korea was optimistic about the resumption of the talks. ""The government hopes that the six-party talks will resume at an early date as agreed,"" said Choo Kyu-ho, spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry."
politics,"Emilio Menendez, a Spaniard, and Carlos Baturin German, an American, became the first gay couple to be married under a new law allowing same-sex marriage in Spain. The couple tied the knot in the town of Tres Cantos, outside of Madrid. Wedding guests included family and friends, as well as journalists and politician Pedro Zerolo, the governing Socialist Party's top official for social issues. Spain is only the third nation in Europe to legalise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands and Belgium. The bill was passed by the lower house of Parliament on 30 June 2005, overruling a rejection by the upper house, the Senate. Although the move was opposed by Roman Catholic groups, polls suggest that a majority of Spaniards support the decision. There were protests in Madrid prior to the bill being passed, and a Roman Catholic group submitted a 600,000-signature petition urging a referendum. State run television broadcast images of the happy couple after the ceremony. Menendez told reporters, ""The happiest day of our lives was when we fell in love with each other. We have been together for 30 years, there have been many wonderful days, today is yet another wonderful day."""
politics,"Malwack 2012 US Presidential Election Incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have returned to campaigning after taking time out due to Hurricane Sandy. On Wednesday, Obama visited New Jersey, meeting with Governor Chris Christie in Atlantic City, and spoke to victims of the storm at a community center in Brigantine. Obama earned the praise of the Republican governor who said ""Obama had sprung into action immediately"". The President's reaction to the storm also earned him positive polling, with a Washington Post/ABC survey saying 8 out of 10 respondents thought Obama had responded in a ""good"" or ""excellent"" manner to the storm. After restarting the campaign, Obama has campaigned in Wisconsin where he has attacked Romney's proposed policies as being the same as those of George W. Bush. ""Governor Romney has been using all his talents as a salesman to dress up these very same policies that failed our country so badly - the very same policies we've been cleaning up after for the past four years - and he is offering them up as change."" said the President. Yesterday, the independent mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg gave his endorsement to Obama. With several areas of New York affected by flooding from Hurricane Sandy, the former Republican mayor said Obama's stance on climate change factored in his decision. Writing an editorial for Bloomberg View, the mayor asserted: ""Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be — given the devastation it is wreaking — should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action."" Bloomberg said Obama had taken action to deal with climate change; has proposed measures to reduce emissions from cars and power plants. Bloomberg explained he could not support Romney as the Republican challenger had changed his position on several issues. ""In the past he has taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care – but he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the very health care model he signed into law in Massachusetts,"" said Bloomberg. Bloomberg did however have some criticism of Obama. He said that Obama had ""engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it."" Responding in a statement, Obama said he was ""honored to have Mayor Bloomberg’s endorsement"". Romney spoke at an event in the city of Roanoke, Virginia, criticising Obama's proposal to create a cabinet-level position for business development. In his speech in Virginia, Romney stated: ""I don't think adding a new chair in his cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street. We don’t need a secretary of business to understand business. We need a president who understands business and I do."" Romney also launched a TV advert which stated that the idea represents a broader failing of the Obama presidency by suggesting that Obama's ""solution to everything is to add another bureaucrat."" Which candidate do you believe would better-represent the United States? After speaking in Roanoke, Romney spoke in Doswell, Virginia. His speech was interrupted by a protester who shouted ""Climate change caused Sandy! Let's get real!"" Romney plans to make a last-minute campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Sunday. Jill Stein, the presidential candidate for the Green Party of the United States, was arrested on Wednesday in Winnsboro in east Texas for misdemeanor criminal trespassing while trying to bring food and confectionery to environmental protesters who have been camping in trees for over a month to protest the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Stein has been released pending a court date."
politics,"Climate changeThe leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) countries are meeting in L'Aquila, Italy, from July 8 to July 11. On Wednesday, the group announced that it had agreed to a cut in carbon emissions. The G8 agreed to a target to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, though interim targets were not defined. ""I believe we've made some important strides forward as we move towards Copenhagen,"" said United States President Barack Obama. ""I don't think I have to emphasise that climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. The science is clear and conclusive and the impacts can no longer be ignored."" Obama was referring to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""I hope tomorrow when we meet other countries we'll follow that through and this is a very significant development, the first time it's ever been done,"" United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. ""The commitments expressed today at the G8 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) leaders' meeting, while welcome, are not sufficient,""Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, said. ""For us the 80 percent figure is unacceptable and likely unattainable,"" said Arkady Dvorkovich, the top economic aide to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. ""We won't sacrifice economic growth for the sake of emission reduction."""
politics,"2008 US Presidential ElectionIndependent United States presidential candidate Ralph Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez were selected as the presidential and vice-presidential nominees of the California Peace and Freedom Party during its convention on August 2. Nader won the nomination with 46 votes or 60.7% of the ballots, edging out challengers Gloria La Riva, Brian Moore and Cynthia McKinney. The nomination guarantees ballot access for Nader in California, which accounts for 10% of the national vote. Prior to the convention, Nader participated in a forum in Sacramento on August 1 with his three challengers. The meeting lasted three hours in a standing-room packed to capacity. After the forum, delegates from the party cast their ballots among the four candidates. Following Nader, La Riva, the nominee of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, received 27 votes. Moore, the nominee of the Socialist Party, received 10 votes and Green Party nominee McKinney finished in last place with 6 votes. Following the nomination, the Peace and Freedom Party praised Nader and Gonzalez, arguing that, ""both nominees agree with the fundamentals of the Peace and Freedom platform and bring with them a strong combination of experience, credibility, and legislative accomplishment.” The party platform includes support for socialism, feminism and environmentalism. -"
politics,"Lawyers asked a federal court Friday to allow the government to inspect written materials that it seized from inmates at Guantanamo Bay last month and requested approval to use ""filter teams"" to look at documents that may contain privileged lawyer-client communication. In documents they filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, government lawyers argued that three inmates who committed suicide last month by hanging themselves coordinated their actions by using attorney-client confidentiality to communicate with each other. Government officials said that among papers marked ""Attorney Client Privilege"" were instructions on how to tie knots and a classified memo on camp activities and inmate locations. Military officials seized more than 1,100 pounds of documents from inmates after the suicides on June 10. They have since stopped defense lawyers from sending any documents to inmates. In an affidavit that lawyers for the government filed with the court, Rear Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., the naval commander of the camp, described evidence of a ""larger plan or pact for more suicides"" among detainees. His statement implied that the investigation might extend to defense attorneys as third parties who ""encouraged, ordered or assisted"" the detainees in killing themselves. Harris earlier described the suicides as part of a pattern of hostile actions on the part of terror suspects. ""They have no regard for life, either ours or their own,"" he said last month. ""I believe this was not an act of desperation, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us."" The Center for Constitutional Rights, which has provided legal assistance to about 200 Guantanamo detainees, has been critical of the conditions at Guantanamo Bay that they say finally led the detainees to kill themselves in desperation. Barbara Olshansky, a deputy legal director at CCR, described the government's latest legal activity as a tactic to impede detainees' access to legal representation ""and to make these lawyers fight for yet another thing."" Last month after the document seizures, defense attorney Richard Wilson, who represents a Canadian detainee, said in an affidavit that the military had told him that they were conducting no investigation into the role of attorneys in the prisoners' deaths. He added, however, that at least one detainee claimed that camp officials had confiscated his written materials and told him that they were looking into ""whether lawyers had actively encouraged detainees to commit suicide."""
politics,"Somalia With violence against foreigners escalating daily, and after being deluged with various threats and demands from al-Shabaab, a radical Islamic militant group with ties to al-Qaeda, the United Nations World Food Programme announced on Tuesday that, as of the end of this week, they are going to suspend all of their operations within southern Somalia—including the distribution of desperately needed food aid to Somali civilians. This is now the third humanitarian agency, after CARE International and Doctors Without Borders, to evacuate from the war-torn nation. The pull out, which will include the closing down of all UN offices and the withdrawal of all local staff, is going to effect over one million Somalis—many of whom relay on this food program for their daily meals. When asked by the New York Times to further explain the UN's decision, Peter Smerdon, a spokesperson for the program, said via telephone from Nairobi, Kenya, ""In the past few weeks there has been a harder line of unacceptable demands and conditions set by armed groups (such as al-Shabaab) in these areas. We sadly had to make the decision to pull our staff out."" Smerdon also cited the fact that over forty aid workers have been killed between January 2008 and September 2009, and that four volunteers still remain in the hands of their captors. Furthermore, when asked how this move by the UN will effect the Somali people, Smerdon said simply, ""People will go hungry...you could see malnutrition rates rising as a result."" When asked by a British newspaper, The Morning Star, the same question, another program representative, Emilia Casella, conveyed like sentiments, ""Those dependent on food assistance in southern Somalia face a situation that is particularly dire."" In a nation that—due to civil war—has not had a functioning government in over two decades, Islamic extremists groups—such as al-Shabaab—as well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the Horn of Africa nation, except for its besieged capital, Mogadishu, which is protected by African Union and NATO troops in addition to UN peacekeepers. According to the UN, al-Shabaab—which has direct influence over the area that is going to be effected—presented their offices with numerous lists of demands. Among their demands was that the UN pay Shabaab a $20,000 protection fee every six months, seek Shabaab approval for all their projects, fire their entire female staff, and run their operations according to the militant group's schedule. When asked by The Associated Press about the UN's decision to leave southern Somalia—including his own town of Jilib—Somali civilian and father of eight children, Abdullahi Awnur, said that al-Shabaab is responsible for driving the UN food program away, and that what they are doing is ""indirectly killing"" innocent people. Awnur went on to say, ""We have been forced to flee from our houses and depend on UN food aid, and now that it is finished, that means al-Shabaab here does not want us to live."" Despite all that has been said, al-Shabaab spokesperson, Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, told New York Times reporters that he found these claims to be ""baseless"" in their origins. He continued by stating that, ""All we (al-Shabaab) ordered them (the UN) was to buy food from Somali farmers and distribute it. They (the UN) do not want to do that, and because of that, they have made this very ridiculous justification."" Nevertheless, the UN has noted that even when harvests were good, Somali farmers are only able to supply 30-40% of the food needed to sustain the bulk of the country's population. ""Somalia has been described as the most complex emergency in the world, and perhaps the most dangerous to operate in. However, the world is not hearing this,"" say David Gilmour director of CARE International's Somali branch."
politics,"PalestineSecretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has demanded a full investigation into the attacks on UN schools in the Gaza Strip after personally visiting the destroyed complexes in the Strip. ""I am just appalled and not able to describe how I am feeling having seen this ... it's an outrageous and totally unacceptable attack against the UN. I have protested many times, and I protest again in the strongest terms,"" stated Ban during a press conference in the Strip on Tuesday. Ban also denounced the ""shocking and alarming"" devastation in Gaza, and also added that he believes rocket attacks from Hamas are ""unnacceptable"". He also said that the UN would help the Palestinians overcome the devastation which he described as, ""shocking and alarming"". The schools shelled by Israel, were housing refugees when they were hit with tank shells, one of the attacks killed 50 refugees. At first Israel claimed there was mortar fire from Hamas militants coming from the schools, the Israeli army later retracted those claims and says it is investigating the incidents. A spokesman for the UN has said Ban's purpose in Gaza was to ""express solidarity with Palestinian suffering"". Ban also plans to visit parts of Israel struck by Hamas rockets. Decomposing bodies continue to be pulled from the rubble in Gaza bringing death toll to 1,300, among the dead are 400 children, and 100 women. The UN says that 400,000 Palestinians are without running water, and that 100,000 people have been left homeless. The World Health Organization has warned that there is a high possibility that diseases may break out because of the number of decomposing bodies and the sewage that now runs through the streets in the Strip. Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni said on a radio programme: ""We had achievements that for a long time Israel did not have. And therefore, you also have to know when to make the decision to stop and look. If Hamas got the message that we sent so harshly, then we can stop. If Hamas tries to continue to shoot, then we will continue."" Shaul Mofaz the transport minister of Israel said, ""I think Gazans understand today that it is Hamas that led them to this reality."" After a six month ceasefire agreement expired without a halt to Israel's blockade of Gaza's boundaries, Hamas escalated rocket attacks on southern Israel. On December 27, Israel began its assault on Gaza to eliminate the rocket fire. The offensive lasted more than three weeks."
politics,"Syria On Thursday Islamic State reportedly completed taking the ancient city of Palmyra, Syria. The victory comes just a few days after the group seized Ramadi, Iraq last weekend. The victory puts their forces in a position to strike westward toward a number of strategic positions, including Damascus, the capital of Syria, which is connected to Palmyra by a major highway. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain, estimates over half of Syria &amp;mdash; by area &amp;mdash; is now under Islamic State control. Holding Palmyra also provides them with access to the city’s military bases, airport, and nearby oil fields. Palmyra is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to a variety of ruins, including a Roman colonnaded street. UNESCO has expressed concern for the safety of the ruins now that Islamic State controls the city. The group has previously destroyed ruins and cultural monuments during their military campaigns. The US strategy in the region has relied on air strikes. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has said President Obama is not contemplating a commitment of US forces to combat Islamic State on the ground."
politics,"The Swiss people have voted a double yes in referenda to the proposals over same-sex partnerships and the Schengen/Dublin bilateral agreements. Overall they voted 58.03% for the same-sex partnerships and 54.60% for Schengen/Dublin. The referendum of allowing the registration of same-sex partnerships was widely welcomed with the people voting 58.03% Yes and 41.97% No. Same-sex partnerships are already legal in the cantons of Geneva and Zürich. The partnerships would carry many of the legal rights of marriage, with the exception of adoption rights and fertility treatments. The referendum of the Schengen/Dublin bilateral agreement was initially accepted, despite growing resentment with the electorate. It was passed through with the people voting 54.60% Yes and 45.40% No. The agreement relaxes existing border controls between other participating nations in concert with the Schengen treaty, which is one of the competences for inclusion in the European Union. The bilateral agreement also includes participation in the Dublin treaty, which defines a policy for handling asylum seekers within Schengen participating countries. Also stipulated by the agreements is the use of a unified ""European Informatic System"" for tracking people who are wanted, missing, or are illegal immigrants and also aims to stop traffic of illegal or stolen property. Out of the big 4 main parties the centre-left Social Democrats, the liberal-right Free Democrats and the centre-right Christian Democrats have said yes to both proposals, however the populist-right Swiss People's Party have said no to both proposals."

politics,"North Korea North Korea test fired a ballistic missile from a submarine yesterday, which landed in the Sea of Japan after traveling approximately 500 km (about 300 miles), according to officials of South Korea and the US. The missile was fired from a submarine off North Korea's east coast near Sinpo, officials said, and was reportedly North Korea's first successful launch after missiles only traveled a small distance in previous tests. The South Korean military accused the North Korean government of using the test to increase military tension during the annual South Korean&amp;ndash;US joint military drills, which involve 80,000 South Korean and US troops. North Korea has threatened a preemptive nuclear strike saying the drills were practice for an invasion. This came on the same day as a meeting between the leaders of China, Japan, and South Korea where, according to Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, they ""urged North Korea to exercise self-restraint regarding its provocative action, and to observe the UN Security Council's resolutions"". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the test's intrusion into Japan's air defense identification zone ""a grave threat to our country’s security."""
politics,"Bahrain In Bahrain, tension is building between the opposition protesters who want to revive last year's marches, and government authorities who are trying to maintain control over protest activities. A planned march by the February 14 Youth Coalition to Manama's former Pearl Roundabout, to mark the beginning of last year's protests, was overwhelmed by the security surrounding the site on the eve of the anniversary as well as the day itself. Since the Bahraini uprising in 2011, the roundabout became a touchstone of opposition. Authorities responded by clearing the site and renaming it al-Farouq Junction. Whilst initially blocked to traffic to prevent any more protests, Bahrain's police now occupy the area and are demonstrably equipped to repel opposition. Clashes around the site between security forces and Bahraini youth took place Monday as one of the largest crowds yet moved close to the symbol of last year's protest movement. Again, on Tuesday, crowds were repelled from Pearl Roundabout with police using tear-gas and arresting protesters throughout the city. Security forces also detained six U.S. citizens who took part in the protests; the activists, who entered the country on tourist visas, agreed to leave the country without charges being pressed. With activists and political parties called for mass protests a few days prior to the one-year anniversary, the government now says it may bring charges against organizers for encouraging the disorder. Nabeel Rajab, a prominent human rights activist in Bahrain, announced his intention to take part in marches to the Pearl Roundabout. He led several hundred pro-democracy activists in Manama's old market area before suddenly marching towards the Pearl Roundabout. The protest ended a few hundred meters away from the roundabout with police firing tear gas and stun grenades after using megaphones to warn protesters the march was unauthorised and they should disperse. Two women from US-based rights group Witness Bahrain taking part in Sunday's march were arrested and deported. 4=Ayat al-Qormozi Five opposition political groups headed by Al Wefaq, Bahrain's largest political opposition party, organized an authorized sit-in in a yard, dubbed 'Freedom Square', in Al Muqsha village outside of Manama. This is the same location as the opposition's week-long 'sit-in' for political reforms. At that sit-in last week, Ayat al-Qormozi, a Bahraini female poet and visible leader in the opposition movement, called for the crowd in Al Muqsha to march to the symbolic roundabout and chanted, ""We will return. We will return."" Most clashes between police and protesters occurred in the Shia neighborhoods. About 70 percent of Bahrainis are Shia and they form the base of the youth activists and Al-Wefaq protesters. The Sunnis have organized counter-demonstrations in support of the ruling Al Khalifa family. They control the government's cabinet, and are also Sunni. The formation of the cabinet is one of the key debates between the opposition Al Wefaq and the Sunni minority in country. Al Wefaq wants elected politicians to name the cabinet, whilst the Sunnis prefer the royal family to retain that power. In an interview with Der Spiegel, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa denied that there was an opposition in his country similar to those in Western nations but accepted that there are ""people with different views."""

Beginning at 6 A.M. local time (1100 UTC), couples began submitting marriage applications at local courthouses citywide. Washington D.C. becomes the seventh United States territory to legalize same sex marriage. The bill was ratified by Mayor Adrian Fenty last December. Due to city's territorial status as a federal district, the bill had to be reviewed by congress. The bill passed congressional review Tuesday night. The bill faced opposition from many family values activists, who tried to stop the bill from becoming law. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts rejected a lawsuit to prevent the measure."
politics,"Australia Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten, speaking in Cairns yesterday, pledged an A$500 million fund towards research and programs to help protect Australia's environmental icon The Great Barrier Reef. Recent surveys indicated coral bleaching has killed more than a third of coral in the Great Barrier Reef's north and central regions. ""All of this"", said Mr Shorten, ""is at risk if serious action is not taken to protect it. The Great Barrier Reef is an environmental treasure Australia holds on trust for the world"". The Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies performed the surveys. Bleaching is associated with higher-than-average water temperatures resulting from El Niño events, affected by climate change. ARC said bleaching had affected all but seven percent of the reef. This bleaching event is the third of its kind with notable occurrences in 1998 and 2002. This event in particular has had the biggest impact on the reef so far. Two weeks ago, James Cook University scientists said the government would have to commit A$10 billion over the next decade or the reef would be incurable in half that time. Mr Shorten's $500 million investment in research and protection of the reef would be spread over four years."

Italy had proposed a resolution against capital punishments several times&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in 1994, 1999, and in 2003&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; but had been denied in all cases.

Italy confirms to be at the forefront regarding protection of human rights. The fight against capital punishment at an international level is one of the priorities in foreign policy, that attracts the government, institutions, political-parliamentary forces, and non-governmental organizations in a campaign ... and we are convinced that it has produced a first relevant result."
politics,"Angela Merkel chaired the European Summit in Brussels. European Union leaders on the second day of their summit have agreed on measures to decrease emission of greenhouse gases and to start using more biological fuels. The governments of the 27 countries in Brussels endorsed 3 main binding targets: * to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by the year 2020 by 20% compared to the level of 1990 * renewable energy should make up 20% of energy consumption by 2020 * a 10% share for biofuels in the total consumption of fuels in E.U. transport. This way, the E.U. wants to contribute in reaching the strategic goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The individual targets for countries will need to be established based on national starting points and potentials, according to the plan. The plans don't mention an enforcement mechanism yet. 4=European Commission PresidentJosé Manuel Barroso In the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading force in international climate protection. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the targets ""ambitious and credible"". Europe is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the Kyoto protocol ends. In June, Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the Group of Eight summit. The proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member state should decide if they wish to use nuclear power or not. Some countries oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, and Germany is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. France on the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants. 13% of France's total energy consumption is nuclear. The report also stresses the importance of nuclear safety in the discussion over nuclear energy. The summit also asked the European Commission to come up with proposals to reduce energy consumption in lighting and offices by 2008 and 2009. The idea is to replace conventional light bulbs with more energy-efficient alternatives such as the energy saving light bulb. Another energy-related topic in the conclusions is an agreement on increased security of energy supply. Through member state solidarity and a more interconnected and integrated market, eastern European countries hope to secure their energy supplies in case Russia would cut the supply. During their two-days summit, the E.U. also discussed economic growth, employment, better regulations and international relations issues."
politics,"The Finnish police have added Finnish hacker Matti Nikki's website lapsiporno.info criticizing Internet censorship to Finland’s new national child porn filter. The blacklisting was noticed when Finland's second largest Internet service provider Elisa started blocking the page today. More of the ISP's are expected to join the filtering when their blacklists are updated from the police's master list. The banned site has been a harsh critic of Internet censorship over the last three years. It contains information and news about how censorship has been discussed and developing in Finland. Although the site's provocative name is lapsiporno.info (""childporn.info"") there is no child porn on the site - the content is mainly text. Tekniikka &amp; Talous magazine asked Commissioner Lars Henriksson of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) why the page was censored. His answer was that he cannot discuss individual sites, but said that sites which are linking to child porn pages are also within the scope of the law. This interpretation, however, seems to conflict with the actual laws, the scope of which was supposed to be only sites with illegal pictures in foreign countries. On Wednesday, NBI confirmed that site was censored because it published and maintained an incomplete version of the Finnish child porn blacklist. Nikki's list contained roughly two-thirds of the 1500 blacklist entries, and it was created by scanning a large amount of sites and logging the censored pages. The scan also found that the top three results of a Google search for ""gay porn"" are blacklisted, and that most of the blocked sites are actually physically located in the United States or the European Union. Leena Romppainen of Electronic Frontier Finland commented that ""The local authorities have taken no action on these sites. Therefore, either the sites do not contain child pornography or the NBI has not informed the local authorities. Both of the alternatives are equally scary."" Matti Nikki's opinion is that the majority of the censored sites are legal adult sites and that the police are not doing that much research when they are deciding which sites to block. Internet censorship has been a hot topic in Finland as of late. There have been proposals of extending Internet filtering to Internet gambling sites, sites related to terrorism and violence, and torrent-tracker The Pirate Bay. Lapsiporno.info"

He added the president had pledged that ""all territory would be freed from the Tamil Tigers' control"". The president's comments come as the Sri Lankan army has forced the Tiger rebels, known formally as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), onto a small strip of coastline about 1.5 in length Thursday night. About 20,000&amp;ndash;25,000 troops have been gathered for the final attack, and have encircled approximately 1,200&amp;ndash;1,500 of the rebels. The Tigers have been accused of holding civilians as human shields and shooting at those trying to flee, an accusation that they have denied. There are few impartial accounts of the fighting as the government has prevented journalists and aid workers from entering the area. The country's government has rebuffed international worries over thousands of civilians that are located in and around the war zone that have been threatened by powerful artillery bombarding the area. The United Nations says that a further fifty thousand are estimated to still remain in the no-fire zone. In past months, approximately 200,000 civilians have fled from the war zones, and are currently residing in displacement camps. Sri Lankan armies are largely supported by both India and USA, in a strategic calculus aiming to erase Tamil tiger resistances, who claim communist background.

politics,"Following accusations issued by the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), British Member of Parliament George Galloway and Senator Charles Pasqua of France have vehemently denied any wrongdoing. George Galloway declared: I've now had a chance to read the report which was compiled without this Senate committee asking me a single question about these absurd allegations. I repeat once more. I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq. One of the companies named, with ostensible links to me-- Aredio Petroleum-- I have never heard of until today and I have certainly had no dealings with. The other company, Middle East Advanced Semiconductors, was owned by Fawaz Zureikat, who was the chairman of the Mariam Appeal. It is well-known that Mr Zureikat traded with Iraq but he did not do so on my behalf. I have not received a penny piece or any oil voucher from Iraq, directly or indirectly. You would have thought that natural justice would have demanded that these allegations would have-- must have been!-- put to me, but they haven't been. Senator Joseph McCarthy would have been proud of this committee. On May 17, Galloway appeared before the U.S. senatorial panel and vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a tone seldom used in a senatorial hearing. He accused the U.S. administration of creating a ""smoke screen"" to divert attention away from the situation in Iraq. He also declared, ""The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government."" Galloway denied receiving any money out of the scheme. Galloway demanded, ""What counts is, where's the money, senator? Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars? The answer to that is nobody,"" while glaring toward U.S. senator Norm Coleman (Republican from Minnesota), according to a New York Times report. Galloway also accused the US senators, especially senator Coleman, of shoddy standards of justice. He claimed they have already ruled him guilty, and that they rely on dubious evidence and wrongful or coerced testimonies. Galloway declared: You have my name on lists provided to you... by the convicted bank robber and fraudster and con man Ahmed Chalabi, who many people, to their credit, in your country now realize played a decisive role in leading your country into the disaster in Iraq. In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison1, in Bagram Air Base Afghanistan, in Guantanamo Bay -- including, if I may say, British citizens being held in those places -- I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything you manage to get from a prisoner in those circumstances. 1. Alluding to the acknowledged Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Charles Pasqua also denies any personal wrongdoing in the case. Pasqua indicated that he was ""serene"" and that he hoped the investigations by the U.S. Senate would probe the matter to the bottom. Pasqua judged the situation detrimental to relationships between the United States and France. For this reason, Pasqua declared that he had asked the president of the French Senate for the creation of an investigation commission, wishing that the French and U.S. senatorial commissions should collaborate. Pasqua declared himself convinced that misconduct took place in the oil-for-food program, and that it was probable that some French people were involved. He then wished that they should be sought and prosecuted. ""If one wants to find the origin of the financial streams, one can do so."" Pasqua mentioned the Swiss company Genmar, which the U.S. report claims to have served as Pasqua's intermediary. Pasqua denied information presented as facts in the report. For instance, he denied having met Tariq Aziz, former Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq. Pasqua pointed out that nothing in the senatorial evidence indicates that he had benefited from vouchers, only that one of his former advisers, Bernard Guillet, had received oil allocations in his name. From December 2000 onwards, allocations meant for Pasqua ceased and were replaced by allocations to Bernard Guillet. Guillet was arrested by French authorities in April in connection with abuses under the oil-for-food program. Mr Guillet has been put under formal investigation for allegedly participating in a system of occult kickbacks and fees between 1996 and 2001 involving major French companies, including Total. He is suspected of having received amounts of money without good explanation from an intermediary specialized in the resale of Iraqi oil."
politics,"Crime and law The Bolivian President Evo Morales announced Thursday he will file legal charges against the United States President Barack Obama for crimes against humanity. President Morales announced he was preparing litigation after Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro's plane was allegedly denied entry into U.S. airspace over Puerto Rico. President Morales called Obama a ""criminal"" violating international law. Morales called an emergency meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), made up of 33 member states including Argentina, Mexico and Chile, and encouraged member states to remove their ambassadors from the U.S. to show their solidarity. He asked Bolivarian Alliance member states to boycott the next United Nations meeting, to be held in New York on September 24. He also said the U.S. had pursued a policy of ""intimidation"" and have a history of blockading presidential flights. In July this year, the Bolivian presidential aircraft was prevented from landing in Portugal to refuel, allegedly at the request of the U.S. administration. After Italy, Spain and France each banned the aircraft from entering their airspace, it was ultimately forced to land in Austria. Here, the plane was boarded as part of the search for U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden. Several Latin American heads of state promptly condemned the actions. President Evo Morales is in his second presidential term after first being elected in 2005. He campaigned on the promise of alleviating Bolivia's crippling poverty &amp;mdash; Bolivia was Latin America's poorest nation at the time he was elected &amp;mdash; and is Bolivia's first indigenous leader. He became internationally recognisable for the striped jumper he wore while meeting with high level dignitaries, including kings and presidents, around the world. His actions as President have included halving his own salary and those of his ministers, seizing Bolivia's gas and oil reserves, and redistributing the nation's unused countryside to the poor. President Morales had been bound for bilateral talks in China. He maintains he will not be prevented from attending them."
politics,"It's now been three weeks since the four-person Lakota Freedom Delegation declared that the Lakota people were withdrawing from their treaties with the United States and, though small, the movement still proves controversial: two U.S.-recognized Lakota tribal governments have rejected the Delegation's authority outright with at least one tribe stating it will consider the Delegation's, now Lakota Oyate's, proposal. The rest of the tribes have remained silent. The central figure the movement has been Canupa Gluha Mani, a longtime activist whose tactics have led repeatedly to his arrest and imprisonment — most recently in June 2007, when Canupa Gluha Mani was one of six arrested who participated in blockading a road in Nebraska to keep outside alcohol from entering his dry reservation where it is banned. Wikinews talked to Canupa Gluha Mani about the movement and Lakota Oyate in an exclusive interview. Naomi Archer Also called Duane Martin Sr, Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to be referred to as just that, ""Canupa Gluha Mani""; it means ""He walks as he protects the pipe"", though much of the meaning is lost in translation between English and the delicately-nuanced Lakota language. Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to speak in this, his native tongue &amp;mdash; he ""hates"" that the English language has become the everyday language of the Lakota, and decries the extinction of many indigenous American languages &amp;mdash; but uses English fluently and earthily. Canupa Gluha Mani talked about the Cante Tenza, the Strong Heart Warrior Society, which he heads and which forms the paramilitary force of Lakotah. The society, an okolakiciye or warrior society, originated in the Black Hills. He told the following story: Four warriors in the hills ran across a coyote and gave it chase. And as the coyote ran he turned into a Lakota man, and in his changing the man left four objects: a rattle, a drum, a lance, and a tomahawk with which the Lakota people could be defended. Canupa Gluha Mani is a warrior leader, and his position with relation to the treaty council which traditionally governs the Lakota is ""whip-man"", loosely ""sergeant at arms"" &amp;mdash; that is, he enforces order and decorum when passions grow heated during tribal discussions. The authority of the Lakota Freedom Delegation, he says, comes not from the BIA-recognized governments but rather from the ""people who understand treaties"", i.e. the treaty council, from among the Seven Sister Bands of the Lakota. This traditional government is based on the idea of ""staying quiet and listening to the people who have answers"", the ""itacans"" or expert headmen. Canupa Gluha Mani also endorsed Naomi Archer, who has acted as Lakota Oyate's liaison; indeed, as the Lakota Freedom Delegation prepared its trip to Washington DC he called in Naomi Archer, who though of non-native extraction is his adopted sister and a fellow Cante Tenza member, to handle media support. ""I support the understandings of what she's saying"", he said, referring to a previous interview with Archer which revealed an apparent split between Russell Means and other members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation. ""She as an individual has integrity."" However, the previous interview missed nuances and the perceived gap between Lakota Oyate and Russell Means' Republic of Lakota is not so great. ""There's no division here....it's communication, that's all. We can always get past this."" With regard to Russell Means, who has declared himself Chief Facilitator of the Republic of Lakotah, he said, ""I've worked with my uncle Russell Means in positive venues. And I'm still behind him, I have love for him;"" He emphasized the familial bond between himelf and Means, noting that Means had adopted him as a nephew. However, ""the Lakota have to be recognized."" It was ""genocide"", he said, that of all the races of humanity, American Indians are not represented at the United Nations. On the subject of Lakota activist Alfred Bone Shirt, who organized the Lakota Oyate's first freedom celebration and information meeting on Saturday, 5 January but has since made comments attacking the legitimacy of Canupa Gluha Mani, Naomi Archer and Lakota Oyate, Canupa Gluha Mani had this to say. ""I have nothing to do with Mr Bone Shirt, nothing against him"". He also noted that Lakota Oyate had respected Bone Shirt's call to take down invitations for donations, but expressed a wish that Mr Bone Shirt would make the same call to any other website inviting donations to Lakotah. The traditional decision making process within the Lakota, he said, was informal discussions among the women of the Lakota rather than pronouncements and declarations. Ideas like western forms of government &amp;mdash; referencing the ""Republic"" &amp;mdash; and the use of the English language were part of the reason for both the misunderstanding of the dispute between Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani and the Lakota's problems: ""It's hard for Indian people to adapt to this modern lifestyle....It's white teaching that cause Indian problem....leave us alone....This country has not learned a thing about its own First Nations people."" US governing of Lakota has led directly to the economic and social decline of the Lakotah people, he argues. Canupa Gluha Mani noted that the life expectancy for Lakota men is only 44, and that alcohol and drug use are epidemic, as are infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. But revival of the Lakota has to be not just economic to improve the circumstances of the people, but cultural too: ""Our language is at stake right now"" but the US government-backed institutions like the Tribal Police are just ""the second coming of the white man's cavalry"". Canupa Gluha Mani is on record as saying in a previous interview that ""we'll probably get killed for"" withdrawing from the United States. Now, he is tight-lipped on the future, and when asked about the possibility of a confrontation with the US will only say that ""anything's plausible."" And if the United States government leaves the Lakota alone? ""Then we can take our practices forward in good will."" Canupa Gluha Mani, who is married to a woman of European descent, says that the traditional American Indian lifestyle can coexist with the western lifestyle, but ""every wound has to heal"". ""We can be self-sufficient. We can govern ourselves."" Having withdrawn from the outstanding treaties with the United States, will Lakota Oyate make a new arrangement with Washington? ""That has yet to be exonerated."" Lakotah continues to seek international recognition; although no country has declared recognition for Lakotah, he is ""confident with the Bolivians"" and also noted a positive response from the ""Bulgarian freedom fighters"" pressuring the US to recognize Lakota independence. Canupa Gluha Mani then addressed the Lakota people directly. ""What needs to get out there is, I love my people....This is your dream come true. That's what the symbolic meaning of Lakotah is. It's called freedom. Hoka hay."""
politics,"China's president, Hu Jintao, held a press conference on Wednesday with United States president Barack Obama at the White House. The two leaders spoke about relations between their countries. Topics included human rights, trade between the US and China, and climate change. Obama noted that China's position on human rights was occasionally a ""source of tension,"" although it did not ""prevent the U.S. and China from cooperating."" Standing next to each other at the White House, the pair took questions from reporters on the scene. One asked how ""the US can work with a country known for treating its people so poorly, using censorship and force to repress its people."" Obama replied ""China has a different political system than we do. China is at a different stage of development than we are. We come from very different cultures and with very different histories. But as I've said before and I repeated to President Hu, we had some core views as Americans about the universality of certain rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly that we think are very important and transcend cultures. I have been very candid with President Hu about these issues."" Hu did not initially respond to this question, blaming technical problems. However, upon being asked later, he stated ""a lot still needs to be done"" with human rights in the country. Hu stated that both China and the United States must appreciate their individual interests. According to CBS News, the Chinese president was in an ""unfamiliar setting""; BBC News noted that the meeting was ""rare""."
politics,"LGBT On Monday, Chilean president Michelle Bachelet signed a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. The bill awaits approval from the two houses of congress to pass, which would also permit LGBT couples to adopt children. Currently, only marriage between a man and a woman is recognised in Chile. Two years ago, Chile legalised civil unions of same-sex couples. The bill was signed at La Moneda Palace, the presidential palace. LGBT activists attended the signing ceremony; at least 200 attendees were expected. Chile is a largely Roman Catholic country, and the Roman Catholic Church has been against the idea of same-sex unions. During the signing ceremony, Bachelet said, ""it is not ethical nor fair to put artificial limits on love"". She tweeted, For love there are no conditions. For moving forward towards an inclusive Chile, today I signed bill of #EqualMarriage Under Bachelet's presidency, Chile saw changes in the abortion laws last week. Abortions are now allowed for cases like pregnancy from rape, or conditions endangering the mother's life or where the foetus cannot survive. Chile saw a total ban on abortion in 1989 under General Pinochet. Bachelet's term is to end in March. Former president and candidate in November's Chilean presidential election Sebastián Piñera is against the legalisation of same-sex marriage, and said: ""There should not be discrimination, but at the same time the essence of an institution such as marriage should be respected, which has always been about conserving the human race"". Sex among partners of the same gender has been legal in Chile since 1999. Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are among South American countries where same-sex couples are allowed to marry."

politics,"2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine On Tuesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing war crimes against civilians during the ongoing invasion via live video feed to the United Nations Security Council. Zelenskyy said: ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country. They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone who is alive. They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" Demanding the perpetrators and their superiors be brought before a war crimes tribunal and held accountable, he specified: ""They cut off limbs, cut their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children."" Russian ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya repeated that the Government of Russia denies the allegations. He asserted that video footage was a ""crude forgery"" arranged by Ukraine. ""You only saw what they showed you. The only ones who would fall for this are Western dilettantes,"" he said. Ukraine said it found hundreds of dead bodies, notably in Bucha, after forces reclaimed areas outside capital city Kyiv. Iryna Venediktova, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, said on Sunday that 410 bodies were found in areas around Kyiv, telling Reuters: ""We need to work with witnesses"" to assess the extent of the crimes. ""People today are so stressed that they are physically unable to speak,"" she said. On Sunday, Zelenskyy accused Russia of seeking: ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine."" Asked if it was genocide on CBS program Face the Nation, Zelenskyy said: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" Ukraine released images depicting people shot in the back of the head, many with their hands tied behind their backs. The Russian Ministry of Defence issued a statement on Monday reading: ""During the time that Bucha has been under the control of the Russian armed forces, not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action. Russian servicemen have delivered and distributed 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid to civilians in the Kyiv Region."" The statement claimed photographs were a hoax and ""provocations of Ukrainian radicals."" Satellite photography over Bucha from Maxar Technologies appeared to show dead bodies in the same positions for weeks, as well as a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. According to CNN, people were hoping to find their relatives in the grave which may contain upwards of a 150 people. Nevertheless, Russia's Director of the Information Maria Zakharova, denied the legitimacy of footage from Bucha. ""Who are the masters of provocation? Of course the United States and NATO,"" she said, saying the outrage was a planned attempt to tarnish Russia's reputation. International responses were issued earlier this week despite Russia's stance. United Kingdom foreign minister Liz Truss said: ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined: ""We’re tightening the existing sanctions. We’re adding new ones. We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world. And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling."" ""You can expect further sanctions announcements this week. And we are coordinating with our allies and partners on what the exact parameters of that will be,"" added US security advisor Jake Sullivan."

politics,"Russia President Vladimir Putin of Russia today signed a new law increasing the fines available against those involved in unlawful protests, overriding concerns from his human rights advisor and the Council of Europe. The measure was proposed by ruling United Russia after May 7 protests coinciding with Putin's third inauguration saw clashes between protestors and police, with 400 arrests. The United Russia-dominated State Duma voted 241&amp;ndash;147 in favour earlier this week, ahead of a protest scheduled for Russia Day, June 12, in Moscow against Putin's twelve-year rule. The new legislation increases maximum fines for individuals involved in illegal protests from 100 rubles (US$3) to 10,000 rubles (US$300), but those breaching ""the established rules of conduct"" face fines of up to 20,000 rubles, up from a previous high of 1,000 rubles. Officials caught engaging in illegal demonstrations have had their maximum penalty increased from 50,000 to 600,000 rubles (upper equivalent: US$20,000). Organisers of protests that result in injury or damage can be fined up to 300,000 rubles. Smaller violations can be dealt with by detention of up to fifteen days, and up to 200 hours of community service is available as an alternative sentence to a fine. Protestors are banned from concealing their faces and nobody with a criminal record may organise a protest. Supporters say the bill is required for public safety. Putin explained protests ""must be organized in such way that they inflict no damages to other citizens, who do not take part in them"" and insisted authorities ""should apply the new law in such a way that it does not limit the citizens’ right for expression over any issue of internal or external politics, including street marches, events and rallies"". Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, said the law would be published in Saturday's edition of the Rossiyskaya Gazeta; it takes effect instantly upon publication. He said the law matched similar legislation in other European nations. Irina Yarovaya, who leads the State Duma's Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, agreed that health and safety was the law's top priority. Yarovaya noted the 'youth' of democracy in Russia, saying ""We are only beginning to have the experience that other countries have been accumulating for decades and centuries."" She said Putin's ""political mission"" is ""protection of public security and national interests of the country"". Putin says he investigated the laws of European Union members, and found ""There is nothing in our law which would have been more tough than similar legislation in the countries I named,"" which included Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. He today spoke of last year's ""mass riots, torched cars and robbed stores"" in the UK. The law has faced local and international criticism. Mikhail Fedotov, chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Council, urged Putin to veto the law and said much depended on enforcement, which he hoped to be ""moderate"". The Council claims it breaches existing legislation including the constitution. 4=Vladimir Putin Igor Lebedev, a prominent Liberal Democrat, said Putin's signature was ""absolutely expected"". The Liberal Democrats opposed the bill. Yalboko leader Sergey Mitrokhin called the law ""a ban on holding rallies and political actions"" which he cannot organise protests against because ""Now anyone can be punished with slave labor or a crazy fine. I can’t gather people for a rally knowing that they might be sent straight to the galleys from there"". Mikhail Gorbachev, ex-President of the former USSR, characterised today's signing as ""a mistake"" that could leave revisions necessary. Putin himself acknowledged the possibility; ""Nothing we have is frozen solid. If we find out the MPs have missed something, that something must be laid out in a different way... we can approach the State Duma deputies, look at how the law is applied and ask them to make some corrections."" Is the legislation a needed part of efforts to combat disorder, or an attack on the right to protest? Russia's opposition says Putin's true motivation is to provide a response to the planned June 12 rally against him, which stems from widespread claims of irregularities in this year's Presidential election. Ilya Yashin, a leader of the movement, called the law ""absolutely irresponsible policy"" that would not deter protestors. ""The authorities are fighting against the protests, instead of fighting against the injustice that is causing them,"" said Yashin. The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly also spoke out against the law. Putin, however, cautioned that ""A society which permits rallies and marches must protect itself from radicalism""."

The withdrawal would precede the upcoming national elections scheduled for May, and would end 25 years of Syrian military occupation in Lebanon. The news conference came after meetings in Damascus between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Lebanese army chief General Michel Suleiman that dealt with the withdrawal timetable. Roed-Larson said, ""Syria has agreed that subject to the acceptance of the Lebanese authorities, a U.N. verification team will be dispatched to verify the full withdrawal."" The removal of Syrian military presence in Lebanon is a main sticking point of the anti-Syrian, or opposition group, objections towards forming a new government. After a February bombing assassination of the previous Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was also anti-Syrian, he was succeeded by Omar Karami. Massive opposition group street protests forced the pro-Syrian Karami to resign, but a week later he was re-installed by President al-Assad to spear-head the new government's formation. Mr. Karami has been unable to secure opposition group support for forming a new government. The Lebanese Parliament must act soon to form consensus in announcing new elections, or its legal mandate to do so will expire."

The report, entitled ""Australians speak 2005: public opinion and foreign policy"", showed that global warming and nuclear proliferation were greater foreign policy concerns than terrorism and illegal immigration. 70 per cent of Australians were worried about global warming, the report stated, while only 63 per cent were worried about international terrorism. The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal. Mark Wakeham of Greenpeace said, ""Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about greenhouse pollution far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line."" He continued by saying, ""Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050.

On February 18, 2008, a permanent court injunction issued in the California Northern District Court in San Francisco by judge Jeffrey White, California to Bank Julius Baer (BJB), a Swiss Bank, took the domain name offline.

politics,"Tatyana Zelenskaya Russia On Thursday three individuals accused of involvement in the October 2006 killing of journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya were acquitted by a 12-person Russian jury. Not present for the trial nor among the defendants was Rustam Makhmudov, the accused trigger man, suspected to be hiding out abroad. Makhmudov's two brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, were accused of acting as accomplices in the murder. Former police officer with the Moscow Directorate for Combating Organized Crime Sergei Khadzhikurbanov was the final defendant in the trial, charged with engaging the Makhmudov brothers for the contract-style killing and providing the pistol with silencer used. Pavel Ryaguzov, a former FSB agent, was a suspect in a separate and unrelated case who was tried concomitantly to the other three due to a previous association with Khadzhikurbanov. Ryaguzov was also acquitted in his case. In what has been described in many reports as an assassination, Politkovskaya was shot five times in the elevator of her apartment building in central Moscow while returning from a trip to the supermarket on 7 October 2006. She was 48 years old at the time of her death and a mother of two. The date of the event coincided with then-president Vladimir Putin's birthday. http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_RUSSIA_POLITKOVSKAYA?SITE=ORLAG&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT via AP Politkovskaya was a harsh and prominent critic of the Kremlin, many aspects and institutions of contemporary Russian society such as the secret services and high-level corruption, and the Moscow-backed government of Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya. Domestic and international sources have claimed government involvement in her death. With or without government complicity the murder may along with other recent killings indicate that journalists can be slain with impunity, a situation that seriously hampers the rule of law in Russia. Family of the defendants cheered upon the jury forewoman's recitation of the verdict. As the judge declared them free to go the three burst from the metal courtroom cage to join their supporters.

Its official publication date is July 25th. Intended as a response to Hillary Clinton's book ""It Takes a Village"", certain passages of the book have already caused concern in certain circles. Also in the book, Santorum compares abortion to slavery, and advocates against public school systems and two income families. Already facing perhaps the toughest re-election bid in the country, opponents and supporters of Santorum are using the book to tout their positions. T.J. Rooney, the state Democratic Party chairman, had this to say: ""References to how families are compromised when both parents work outside the home, how it takes a societal toll on Pennsylvania families or American families, it just shows a complete lack of understanding of the real world in which the vast majority of Pennsylvanians reside."" Although he's a Democrat himself, journalist Jules Siegel disagrees with Rooney, ""From what I read in the July 10 AP story about Sen. Santorum's encounter with Hillary Clinton, I believe that he and I share common views on some aspects of child-rearing.

politics,"Iraq Yesterday the Peshmerga, military of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Iraq, gained control of parts of the Mosul Dam, as part of their advance against insurgents of the Islamic State. International opposition to the Islamic militant group has grown this week. The Peshmerga were supported this weekend by US airstrikes in their attempt to push back the Sunni insurgents, and Kurdish officials reported ""good progress"" in the face of ""fierce resistance"". Reuters reported eyewitness accounts of Kurdish forces successfully retaking Batmaiya and Telasqaf, mostly Christian towns as close to Mosul &amp;mdash; about 18 miles (30 km) &amp;mdash; as they have come since June when government forces were forced out. Mosul Dam, Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, is vital to the region's irrigation, as well as water and power supplies. It was seized by the insurgents of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, on August 7, as part of their advance across Northern Iraq. The advance of the Islamic State has prompted responses from many parts of the international community. On Friday the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution targeting the extremist group's finances and leaders. Six individuals were named and now face travel bans, asset freezes, and arms embargoes. The resolution also warned of the possibility of other sanctions against anyone found to be trading with the Islamic State, in a move aimed at stopping their supply of weapons and economic gain from sale of oil being produced by the oil fields under their control. On the same day as the Security Council's resolution, foreign ministers of the European Union's member states issued a joint statement welcoming the efforts of those European states supporting Kurdish forces. This support includes the supply of military supplies from France, and humanitarian aid from the UK, with Eastern European countries providing military materials also being transported by the UK. Germany and the Netherlands were also reportedly considering the possibility of supplying aid where needed. The US began launching airstrikes on August 8, and have continued to do so in support of the Kurdish forces and civilians stranded on Mount Sinjar. The responses from the international community follow reports of brutality against religious minorities in Northern Iraq &amp;mdash; such as Yazidis and Christians &amp;mdash; accompanying the Islamic State advance across the region. Rudaw reported from within Kurdistan that the local political parties have put aside their differences and are recruiting volunteers to send to the front. Many of these parties can trace their beginnings back to the 1960s&amp;ndash;1990s struggle against the Iraqi army, many of whom continue to maintain militias which are now being deployed to reinforce the Kurdish army in the region. These are reported to have been joined by groups of ethnic Kurds from Iran. Reports say hundreds of Yazidi volunteers are also being trained inside Kurdistan to help fight the Islamic State's advance."
politics,"MexicoLawmakers in the municipality of Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, became the first to approve gay marriage in Latin America yesterday, despite opposition from conservative groups and the Catholic Church. ""It was approved overall by 39 votes in favor and twenty against, with five abstentions,"" said a spokesman for David Razu, the bill's chief sponsor. Razu proposed the bill to allow same-sex couples to have the same access as heterosexual married couples to social security and other benefits. Some cities in countries in Latin America, such as Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador permit homosexual civil unions, Uruguay permits civil unions throughout the country as well as adoption, and last month a court in Argentina blocked a bill proposing gay marriage; the country's Supreme Court has yet to make the final ruling. Spokesman Oscar Oliver said that the next step for the capital's lawmakers was to use a measure in the bill intended to permit adoption for same-sex married couples."
politics,"In testimony at a military hearing yesterday on abuses at the U.S. prison camp in Iraq, the former warden of Abu Ghraib, Maj. David Dinenna, said he attended in September 2003 a meeting with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, who was then commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Maj. Dinenna said Gen. Miller recommended using dogs, because of their effectiveness. Two dog handler soldiers at Abu Ghraib stand accused in the hearing. Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, 31, and Sgt. Michael J. Smith, 24, are alleged to have used the dogs to threaten and intimidate prisoners. During the defendants' testimony on Tuesday, they said the interrogation techniques used by them on prisoners was learned from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. The Article 32 military court proceeding, which concluded Wednesday in Fort Meade, Maryland, is a preliminary hearing to hear prosecution and defense arguments in the case. The Prosecution is seeking a court-martial with claims that the defendants acted criminally. The Defense contends the soldiers were following orders, and that the charges should be dropped. The investigating officer of the military court, Maj. Glenn Simpkins, has two weeks to weigh the evidence that was presented. Some or all charges could be dropped, but if some charges stand, he will make a recommendation on how Sgts. Cardona and Smith should be dealt with when it goes to trial. The two accused said in yesterday’s testimony that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, approved the use of the dogs. Testimony was also heard from Pvt. Ivan L. “Chip” Frederick, now serving an 8-year sentence in Fort Leavenworth for his role as ringleader in the abuse, who testified by phone from prison that approval was given to use the dogs, and that a civilian interrogator was also sometimes involved in directing which prisoner cells were to be visited by dog handlers. In addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were also part of the series of abuses. Staff Sgt. James Vincent Lucas previously had told Army investigators in Guantanamo that he left Cuba in 2003 to go to Iraq where he, as a member of a 6-man team, taught the “lessons learned” at Guantanamo, and served to “provide guidelines” to interrogators at Abu Ghraib. Legislation sponsored by several Senate Republicans seeks to specifically regulate the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and other military prisons. A co-sponsor of the bill, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), recently released declassified internal memos dating from 2003 and written by top military lawyers. They warned the Pentagon about the aggressive tactics at Guantanamo. The memos noted it would heighten the dangers for U.S. troops caught by the enemy. Army charge sheets accuse Cardona and Smith with maltreating detainees from November 15, 2003, to January 15, 2004 by ""directing, encouraging, or permitting their unmuzzled military working dogs to bark and growl at detainees in order to unlawfully harass and threaten the detainees and in order to make the detainees urinate or defecate on themselves."" Cardona, of Fullerton, with the 42nd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with nine counts. Smith, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with the 523rd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Riley, Kan., was charged with 14 counts."
politics,"Turkey According to a report released by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation ( TESEV) for United Nation's Development Plan, the per capita GNP in Eastern Turkey, an area predominantly inhabited by Kurdish people, is as low as seven percent of that of the European Union on average. The report analyzed a region of 21 cities in Eastern Turkey*. One of the cities included in the report, Şırnak, was reported to be as poor as Botswana, Southern Africa. Other points highlighted in the report included: * 60% of the population in the region was under the poverty line. If this situation persists, people may start to migrate to Northern Iraq. * If 1% of the national income is spent on Eastern Turkey's infrastructure and social investment for 7 years, the region will be enabled to finance itself. If the economic and social conditions in the region are fixed, the fragile relationship between the Turkish government and the Kurdish people of the region may improve. * Access to health services is a primary human right. Without access to health services, one cannot expect that people of this region can live in confidence. Health institutions should employ nurses who speak Kurdish so the patients can communicate with the health services staff. * The use of the private sector is not reliable as a solution. The government should act to remedy the lack of infrastructure in the region."
politics,"A military tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is hearing arguments today over the legality of trying Canadian Omar Khadr for alleged war crimes, given his status as a minor at the time of the incident. Khadr is charged with the murder of Sgt. Christopher Speer, in addition to attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The charges stem from a 2002 incident in which the 15-year old allegedly threw a grenade at U.S. troops after they directed an air-strike at the Afghan compound he was sharing with Mujahideen insurgents. A number of groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have sent a letter to Secretary of Defence Robert Gates alleging that the military tribunal is ""not equipped to meet juvenile justice standards"" and that Khadr should either be tried before a civilian court or repatriated to Canada. Jennifer Daskal, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch explained that the United States ""should not make matters worse by prosecuting him before an unfair military tribunal."" Khadr's lawyer Dennis Edney challenged the attempts to label the 21-year old as a war criminal asking ""...Why is he not being treated as a child soldier?"" Lt Cdr Bill Kuebler, the American military commissions counsel in the case, agreed that the charges should be dismissed since the tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute minors. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper however, has said that his country will not intervene in the case to seek extradition of Khadr, re-affirming Canada's status as the only Western country who has not demanded the release or extradition of their citizens held in Guantanamo. Gitmo Claiming to have been abused, threatened with rape and forced into painful positions since his arrival in Guantanamo in 2002 , Omar Khadr has been the subject of two psychiatric assessments that claimed he suffered from mental disorder as a result of his imprisonment, and was at risk of suicide. Khadr was previously charged by the Guantanamo military commission in November 2005, before the judicial body was ruled ""unlawful"" by the Supreme Court. Last June, a military judge dismissed a second series of charges against Khadr because his 2004 Combatant Status Review Tribunal had classified as an ""enemy combatant"" rather than an ""illegal enemy combatant"", meaning that he did not qualify under the Military Commissions Act. Three months later, however, the Court of Military Commission Review ruled that the Commission would be allowed to make its own determination of the legality of a combatant."
politics,"United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon remarked on the post-election situation in Zimbabwe on Wednesday, expressing concern about the failure of the election commission to release the results. He believes the delay could have ""serious implications"" for Zimbabwe's people. 4=Ban Ki-moon At a summit in New York City, which was attended by the UN Security Council and African Union leaders, Ban said the international community is waiting for ""decisive action"" from the governments of southern Africa. ""Absent a transparent solution to this impasse, the situation could deteriorate further with serious implications for the people of Zimbabwe,"" he said. ""The credibility of the democratic process in Africa could be at stake here."" Ban said the UN is willing to help the Southern African Development Community resolve the crisis, and added that a possible second round of elections would have to be conducted fairly and transparently, in the presence of international observers. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown agreed with the Secretary-General's remarks. He called on the international community to put more pressure on Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who has been accused of rigging the election. ""No one thinks, having seen the result at the polling stations, that President Mugabe has won this election,"" Brown said. ""A stolen election would not be an election at all. The credibility of the democratic process depends on there being a legitimate government."" The summit was chaired by South African President Thabo Mbeki, who insisted on Saturday that there was ""no crisis"" in Zimbabwe. Jacob Zuma, leader of South Africa's ruling ANC party, disagreed with Mbeki, saying that ""the situation is more worrying now given the reported violence that has erupted."""
politics,"&amp;ndash; According to The Times, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The Right Honourable Anthony Charles Lynton Blair wants to involve the United States of America in efforts to reduce anthropogenic interference with Earth's climates. Historically, the United Kingdom's closest partner in this endeavor has been the Federal Republic of Germany. The United States government has famously refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough. He would like to involve the private sector also and he has put this item on top of the G8, so all the large countries of the world have to talk about it. Mr Byers said yesterday: ""The reality is that unless we can get the United States engaged - responsible as it is for around a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - then any hopes of successfully tackling global warming will be doomed to failure. Some sources are saying, Blair is saying these things because he can make the more progressive voters change their mind, so they would vote for him."
politics,"China and Russia have today put forward a jointly-crafted resolution regarding sanctions against North Korea. The document was released to counter a Japanese alternative, which was written in response to last week's Taepodong-2 missile tests. This Sino-Russian version, however, removes sections which could advocate military action against Pyongyang. The move comes after a number of Chinese requests this week to revise the original Japanese version, claiming that tensions in the region would increase if it were to be adopted. As a result, Chinese diplomats have been instructed to veto the initial document, which advocates much stronger sanctions against North Korea than neighbours Russia and China would have felt comfortable with. The two nations presented their revised resolution to the United Nations this afternoon. After reviewing a draft copy - which was released to the Associated Press - several influential nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have reaffirmed their support for Japan's initial version. Both Russia and China, who share a border with the nation, have been placed in a difficult position by last week's missile tests. Both countries have relatively positive relations with North Korea but their commitment to the international community - mainly the UN Security Council - has led to an impartial stance on this issue. The publishing of this ""counter-resolution"" is the first active move the two nations have made against the North since the tests, who still approve of sanctions but describe Japan's proposed extensive restrictions as ""over-reacting."" Japan and the United States have announced tonight that they still intend to put their first resolution to a vote, despite the threat of a veto by China and possibly Russia. A Japanese diplomat has said that the Sino-Russian reworking was ""a step in the right direction"" but lacked decisive wording on important issues. The use of weaker language - namely asking instead of demanding - has also been criticised. South Korea has not commented directly on the new resolution, but has instead urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks, which are seen to be a key step forward in ensuring diplomacy between the nation and its democratic peers."
politics,"Canadian news The Conservative Canadian government have decided to obey the Kyoto bill which was a forced decision by the opposition Liberals. Prior to this decision, the Liberal opposition party said the government could be sued if they would ignore the law. ""If and when that becomes law, the government would respect it. I'll just point out ... that the bill has no plan of action in it, the bill gives the government no authority to spend any money to have a plan of action,"" Canadian PM Stephen Harper told the House on Thursday. ""Of course, if and when that becomes law, the government would respect it."" The bill will be sent to the Senate of Canada for approval before it is actually made law. The legislation will only give the government 60 days to come up with a plan that meets with the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto wants to drop 6% of greenhouse gas emissions starting from 1990 to 2012. The Conservatives say it is bad for the Canadian economy. Political experts are now saying that a federal election could come as soon as spring 2007. The Conservatives were elected on the 23 of January in 2006."
politics,"U.S. Congressional Democrats are asking the Justice Department to investigate whether the CIA's destruction of videotapes documenting the interrogation of terrorism suspects amounts to obstruction of justice. The acknowledgement by Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden that his agency destroyed the interrogation videotapes in 2005 sparked a firestorm of criticism among Congressional Democrats. They suggested the tapes could have provided key evidence in ongoing trials brought by terrorism suspects who are alleging they were tortured. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said, ""What would cause the CIA to take this action? The answer is obvious - cover up. The agency was desperate to cover up damning evidence of their practices."" Human Rights Watch's Senior Counterterrorism Counsel commented to Google news saying, ""The CIA was well aware that its interrogations crossed a line considered by many to be torture. Now some in the CIA may also be guilty of obstruction of justice as well - a serious felony that carries a possible 20 year sentence. There needs to be a serious criminal investigation, and those who have committed crimes should be prosecuted and convicted."" The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are vowing to investigate, and other Democrats are calling on the Justice Department to do the same. ""You cannot destroy material if there is an ongoing investigation. There is a law against it,"" said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. At the White House, spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush only learned of the matter two days ago, after he was briefed by CIA Director Hayden. ""He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday,"" said Perino. Perino defended the CIA interrogation program as legal and critical to national security. She said President Bush supports General Hayden's explanation that the tapes were destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators. But the Senate's number two Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, rejected that argument: ""The defence of the CIA is that they wanted to protect the identity of those CIA employees who were engaged in the interrogation,"" said Durbin. ""Mr. Senate President, that is not a credible defence. We know that it is possible, in fact, easy, to cover the identity and faces of those who were involved in any videotape. Something more was involved here."" The tapes, which documented the use of tough interrogation techniques against key terror suspects in 2002, were destroyed three years later, at a time when there was increasing pressure from defence lawyers to obtain videotapes of detainee interrogations and as Congress had been probing allegations of torture. The Bush administration has maintained it does not use torture, but refuses to say what techniques are used by intelligence agencies in interrogations of terror suspects."
politics,"The House of Lords, the UK's highest court, has ruled that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial contravenes British and European human rights legislation. The appeal, on behalf of nine suspected terrorists, was upheld by the Law Lords with a vote of eight to one. Despite the ruling, Home Secretary Charles Clarke, in his first full day in office, has decided that the terrorists will remain in prison; six of the suspects are being held in Belmarsh prison, the other three in Broadmoor Hospital. The solicitor representing eight of the suspects has said that she will take the case to the European Court of Human Rights if the men are not released immediately. The Liberal Democrats have called on Charles Clarke to stand up to the draconian anti-terror measures enacted by his predecessor, David Blunkett, in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This act was passed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The ruling is the second major blow to Prime Minister Tony Blair's anti-terrorist legislation in the space of 24 hours following the resignation of his key ally, and architect of much of the legislation, David Blunkett yesterday."

""I regret to say that I do not believe the party leader is truly sensitive to the needs of each part of the country and just how big and complex Canada really is."" She disagreed with the party on its stance on the federal budget, same-sex marriage, and Conservative leadership's alliance with the separatist Bloc Québécois to bring down the government. Two days after Stronach switched parties, the ruling Liberals won a crucial vote for their budget by a single vote. If Stronach had not joined the Liberals and voted for the budget, the government would have fallen, forcing a new federal election."
politics,"A roadside bombing and ambush attack today in southern Thailand killed seven Royal Thai Army soldiers and left one injured. Blamed on Muslim insurgents, the attack in Bannang Sata district, Yala, was similar to one on May 31, in which 12 soldiers were killed in one of the deadliest days of the south Thailand insurgency. Today's attackers took M16 rifles belonging to the dead soldiers. As they retreated, they laid spikes on the roads to stall any pursuers. A helicopter was dispatched to airlift the victims. The soldiers were part of a unit assigned to protect public school teachers, who are frequent targets of attack. Earlier in the week, four teachers were killed by gunmen and 13 schools burned in arson attacks. Human Rights Watch issued a report today, saying it believed those responsible for the attacks are separatists. ""Insurgents are terrorizing teachers and schools, which they consider symbols of the Thai state,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement, quoted in the Bangkok Post. ""These attacks are grave crimes and cannot be justified by any cause."" In another attack overnight, three local Muslim leaders were killed and a fourth man in an ambush and shooting attack on their car in Mai Kaen district, Pattani."
politics,"Politics and conflicts Djibouti and Eritrea have spoken to the United Nations security council on Thursday to discuss a border dispute. Djibouti has said that unless the UN intervenes there will be war. The dispute dates back to June when violence erupted between the nations in the border region of Doumeira. The resulting clashes killed an estimated 35 people. The unmarked border remains disputed, and the nations have built up troops on each side of the border, keeping the situation tense. Djibouti's ambassador to the UN, Roble Olhaye, has accused Eritrea of avoiding mediation on the problem. Djibouti's President Omah Guelleh told the UN security council ""Continued inaction in whatever form not only will encourage but will benefit Eritrea's attitude. This would only give my country one option, the option of war."" The Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, claimed to have peaceful intentions and that his nation had no wishes to take new territory. He claimed his country desired ""the cultivation of good neighbourly relations with Djibouti,"" and said that ""Contrary to the claims made, Eritrea has not taken any land that belongs to Djibouti and it does not have any territorial ambitions."" Desta accused Ethiopia of worsening the situation by preparing military forces to help Djibouti. ""Ethiopia has built from the Djiboutian side a network of winding roads up the mount and deployed offensive long-range artillery and heavy equipment directed at Eritrea,"" he said. Olhaye dismissed the idea of Ethiopia's involvement with the claim ""Whatever the Eritrean ambassador has said is hogwash."" The UN security council has urged both nations to show restraint; it was the UN who called on the nations to agree to a ceasefire in June."
politics,"Tom Tancredo has been a member of the United States House of Representatives since 1999, representing the 6th Congressional District of Colorado. He rose to national prominence for his strong stance against illegal immigration and his announcement that he was a Republican candidate in the 2008 Presidential election. David Shankbone recently spoke with the Congressman and posed questions from Wikipedia editors and Wikinews reporters: DS: Throughout my life my father, a lifelong Republican and an avid listener of Rush Limbaugh, told me that all we needed in this country was a Republican Congress, Republican Senate and a Republican White House to get this country on the right track. Last year he expressed his disappointment to me. So many Republicans, like my father, feel lied to or let down by the party. The rationale for the Iraq War, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as Alan Greenspan recently pointed out, the fiscal irresponsibility. People feel there have been many broken promises. Why should someone vote Republican today? :TT: The best reason I can give: we’re not the Democrats. The best thing we have going for us is the Democrats. Maybe that’s as far as I can go; I hope that there are candidates out there who will reflect and carry out the values that your father believes in when he votes Republican. To the extent you can ferret those people out from the others, that’s who he should vote for. The party was taught a pretty harsh lesson in this last election. I have noticed in the last several months we have done a better job of defending Republican principles as the minority than we ever did in the majority. I feel more in tune with the party now than I have throughout the Bush Presidency. Even before he came in, we were in the majority and we were still spending too much. Hopefully we can say that we were spanked by the American public and that we learned our lessons. There are true believers out there who will stick to their guns, and it’s a matter of principle. What’s the alternative? Hillary Clinton? DS: You yourself said you would only serve three terms in Congress, but then broke that promise. What caused you to reverse yourself? :TT: What happened was this: having ‘lame duck’ stamped on your forehead in Congress when they know you are not going to be around. Then the committee assignments become less meaningful. That was just one of the factors. Far more significant was my becoming the most visible Congressional member on the immigration issue. When I came into Congress I approached Lamar Smith, who was “The Man” on immigration, and said to him, “I’ve come to help you on this issue.” I felt it was one of the most serious we face as a nation. Lamar said, “It’s all yours! I’ve had it with 10 years of busting my head against the wall!” I started doing special orders---that’s when you speak to an empty chamber and whoever is watching CSPAN--and I did that night after night and wondered if it was worth it; was anyone paying attention? Then I’d go back to my office to pick up my keys and I’d see all the telephone lines illuminated, and the fax machine would be going, and a pile of e-mails would be handed to me the next day. I realized: people pay attention. I started picking it up, speaking around the country, leading the caucus on it. In time it became apparent there was nobody to hand the baton to; there were supporters, but not one single soul was willing to take it on as their issue. It was the first year of my second term that I sent a letter to every supporter I had. I said I had come to this conclusion that at the end of my third term (which is three years away) I don’t know if I will run again or not, but that the decision would not be based upon the term limit pledge, because immigration issue makes me feel I have a responsibility I can not shirk. I said that if anybody who gave me money based upon my term limits pledge wanted it back, I would do so. I received maybe three requests. DS: There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens in the U.S. To round up and deport millions of people would be a major government undertaking, requiring massive federal spending and invasive enforcement. What level of funding would be necessary for U.S. Immigration and Customs to achieve the level of enforcement that you'd like to see? :TT: Only a relatively slight increase because the only thing you have to do, other than building a barrier on the southern border, is go after employers. We need to go aggressively after the employers, and try to identify some of the more high profile employers who are hiring illegal aliens. Go after them with fines, and if they are not only hiring them but also conspiring to bring them in, then they could go to jail. A perp walk would have a chilling effect. If you break that magnet, most illegal aliens would go home voluntarily. An article in the Rocky Mountain News stated there has been an employer crackdown in Colorado, and that they are going home or moving on to other states. If we did it nationally, they will return home, because the jobs are no longer available. It doesn’t have to happen over time or instantaneously. The costs to the American public for 12 million illegals are enormous and far more than are paid for by the illegal immigrants themselves in taxes. DS: How long would full enforcement take for you to succeed? :TT: It would be a couple of years before employers were weaned off illegal immigrants and then a couple more years before you saw a really significant reduction. DS: Can you explain your remarks about bombing the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina as a deterrent to terrorists operating against the United States. :TT: The question I was answering was ""What would you do if Islamic terrorists set off on or more nuclear devices in the United States?"" My response was that we would need to come up with a deterrent, and that deterrent may very well be a threat to take out their holy sites if they did something like that in the United States. I still believe it is something we must consider as a possible deterrent because at the present time there are no negative consequences that would accrue to the people who commit a crime such as a nuclear, chemical or biological attack. There are no negative consequences; they may die in the attack but that is not a negative consequence for them. Usually they aren’t going to be state actors. DS: But wouldn’t an attack on Mecca and Medina be an attack on a sovereign state? :TT: You are not attacking the state, but the religious ideology itself. Holy sites are not just in Saudi Arabia; there’s a number of them. In fact, Iran has one of the holiest cities in Islam. And I never used the word nuclear device; I was talking about taking out a physical structure. The reason I suggested it as a possible deterrent is because it is the only thing that matches the threat itself. The threat is from a religious ideology. Not just from Islam, but from a nation whose requirements include jihad against infidels, and we are a threat to their culture, which is why they believe we need to be destroyed. We must understand what motivates our opponents in order to develop a successful response. I’ve received death threats, enormous criticism, and I’ve been hung in effigy in Pakistan, but nobody has given me an alternative strategy that would be a deterrent to such an event. I guarantee when you read the national intelligence estimates, you would be hard pressed to not walk away from doing something. DS: Aside from becoming President, if you could be granted three wishes, what would they be? :TT: It was the other night that I saw for the third or fourth time Saving Private Ryan and in the last scene Private Ryan asks, ""Have I been a good man, have I earned it?"" My greatest wish is to be a good father and to have earned everything I have been given in this life. And to be a better Christian. DS: Farmers rely heavily on seasonal manual labor. Strict enforcement of immigration laws will inevitably reduce the pool of migrant labor and thus increase costs. Do you support tariffs or other government intervention to keep American farm products competitive? :TT: No, I don’t , because I challenge the premise of the question. The ability for farmers to obtain workers in the United States is only minimally hampered by the immigration process because there is, in fact, H-2A, the visa that is designed specifically for agricultural workers. We can bring in 10,000,000 if we want to. There are no caps. There are restrictions in terms of pay and healthcare benefits, and that’s what makes hiring illegal aliens more attractive. The costs would increase for certain agricultural interest, but it would be regional. You would also see a very aggressive movement toward the mechanization of farm work. We are seeing it today in a lot of areas. We saw it in the tomato industry with the Bracero Program. That was a program many growers relied heavily upon: workers, primarily from Mexico would come up seasonally, work, and then went back home. It was successful. But liberals ended the program as a bad idea because the immigrants couldn’t bring their families. When that happened, tomato growers said they’d go out of business. Lo and behold they developed machinery that can harvest citrus fruit, and now they are genetically engineering trees that have a thicker bark but are more flexible so they can be shaken by these machines. You’ll see it more and more. DS: Do you agree that our forefathers intended birthright citizenship? :TT: No, the Fourteenth Amendment, upon which the concept of birthright citizenship is based, was a response to the Dred Scott decision. :During the original Senate debate there was an understanding that it wouldn’t be provided to people simply because they were born here, but instead to people under our jurisdiction. For instance, nobody assumes a child born to an embassy employee or an ambassador is a citizen of this country. There was an understanding and a reference to ""under the jurisdiction"" of the United States. DS: You and Karl Rove engaged, in your words, in a screaming match over immigration, and Rove said that you would never again ""darken the doorstep of the White House."" Are you still considered persona non grata at the White House? :TT: Yeah, even though he is gone, the President’s feelings about my criticism of him have not changed. It wasn’t my stand on immigration, it was my criticisms of the President that have made me persona non grata. DS: Psychologist Robert Hare has discussed in his work the use of doublespeak as a hallmark of psychopaths, and social scientists have pointed out that the use of doublespeak is most prevalent in the fields of law and politics. Do these two trends alarm you? :TT Laughs Yes and no. Unfortunately doublespeak is all too characteristic of people in my profession. DS: What is the proper role of Congress in the time of war? :TT: To first declare it, and then to fund it or not. DS: Politics is dominated by lawyers. What other group of people or professions would you prefer to see dominate the field of politics and why? :TT: I can’t think of a particular profession from which I would be more comfortable drawing politicians from. DS: Do you think lawyers are better for handling legislation and as politicians? :TT: No, they don’t offer anything particularly advantageous to the process. I don’t think it should be dominated by one profession. I’ll tell you what this profession is, and it doesn’t matter what field you come out of. There’s something I noticed here. I tell every single freshman I come across that there are very few words of wisdom, having only been here for ten years, that I can pass along to you but there is one thing I can tell you: this place is Chinese water torture on your principles. Every single day there is another drip, and it comes from a call from a colleague asking you to sign on to a bill you wouldn’t have signed on to; but it’s a friend, and it’s not that big a deal. Or a constituent who comes in and asks you to do something and you think it wouldn’t be such a big deal; or a special interest group that asks you to vote for something you wouldn’t vote for. After time it erodes the toughest of shells if one isn’t careful doesn’t think about it. Even if you recognize that these small steps lead to a feeling that remaining here is the ultimate goal; that the acquisition of power or the maintenance of power is the ultimate goal, that really does… it doesn’t matter if you are a lawyer or not, it does seem to have an impact on people. It’s a malady that is very common in Washington, and you have to think about it, you really do, or you will succumb to it. I don’t mean to suggest I’ve been impervious to these pressures, but I’ve tried my best to avoid it. One reason I am persona non grata at the White House is not just because of immigration, but because I refuse to support him on his trade policy, his education policy, Medicare and prescription drugs initiatives. I remember leaving that debate at 6:30 on a Saturday morning , after having the President call every freshman off the floor of the House to badger them into submission until there were enough votes to pass it. I remember a woman, a freshman colleague, walking away in tears saying she had never been through anything like that in her life. Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence. Your dad should have been absolutely mortified, because it was against all of our principles. And I know the leadership was torn, but we had the President pressing us: we had to do it, we had to stay in power, the President is asking us to do it. Principles be damned. There were people who caved in that night who I never in a million years thought would. :And the threats! “You like being Committee Chairman?” Yes I do. “Do you want to be Chairman tomorrow?” And that’s how it happens. I was called into Tom Delay’s office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, “You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.” And I said, “Tom, out of all the things you can threaten with me that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.” DS: You have supported proposed constitutional amendments that would ban abortion and same-sex marriage. You are also a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. Why do you believe that the U.S. Constitution should regulate medical procedures and personal relationships, but not gun ownership? :TT: The issue of medical procedures and relationships: I don’t really believe the federal government or any level of government has any business in determining about who I care about, or who anybody cares about, but I do believe they have a legitimate role, and the federal government has a responsibility, because of reciprocity. We are only one federal judge decision away from having gay marriage imposed on all states. That’s why there is a need for a Constitutional Amendment. I really believe a family--male, female, rearing children--I believe that is an important structure for the state itself, the way we procreate, which hopefully provides a stable environment for children. That is important to the state, and that’s why I think it’s legitimate. The reciprocity clause forces us into thinking about a Constitutional Amendment. I believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned because I think it’s lousy law, and many liberal jurists think it’s lousy because it read into the Constitution a right to privacy. I don’t’ see a connection between these things and the 2nd Amendment. Same-sex marriage and abortion, perhaps, but I don’t see a connection to the Second Amendment question. I support the 2nd Amendment because it is one of the most important we have. It’s a right we have to protect a lot of our other rights. And in our urban centers…and I don’t’ believe as some Second Amendment radicals believe that every single person has that right. I don’t think so! If you have committed a felony, or if you are a danger to yourself or someone else, then you shouldn’t be able to obtain a firearm, but law-abiding citizens should because it gives them a sense of security and protection against people who would do you harm. I don’t believe urban communities are more dangerous because people are allowed to own guns, but because dangerous people have guns. I would feel more comfortable if in the District of Columbia I could carry a concealed gun. I have a permit. DS: You recently spoke out against the Black and Hispanic Congressional caucuses, stating, ""It is utterly hypocritical for Congress to extol the virtues of a color-blind society while officially sanctioning caucuses that are based solely on race. If we are serious about achieving the goal of a colorblind society, Congress should lead by example and end these divisive, race-based caucuses."" Do you also believe there is no longer a need for the NAACP? :TT: No, I think it’s fine, because it’s a private organization, and people can belong to whatever private organization they want, and the need will be determined to a great extent by reality. If in fact people feel committed to an organization that they believe represents their interest, and it’s a voluntary association, that’s fine. All I’m saying is that for Congress to support these things, that run on money that is appropriated--though they fund them in a convoluted way, but it gets there-- my point was about leading by example. If people said we don’t think it’s a good idea, maybe that would have an impact on how people feel about things like the NAACP. I would hope there would be, and I would assume Martin Luther King hoped--that’s his quite about a colorblind society--that there will come a time we don’t need them. That it’s an anachronistic organization. I also don’t believe in the creation of districts on race. DS: You were one of a handful of Republicans who voted for a bill proposed by Maurice Hinchey and Dana Rohrabacher to stop the Department of Justice from raiding medical marijuana patients and caregivers in states where medical marijuana is legal, citing states' rights concerns. On the other hand, you have suggested state legislators and mayors should be imprisoned for passing laws contrary to federal immigration law, and you support the Federal Marriage Amendment to ban gay marriage nationally. How do you reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions? :TT: We are talking about issues that are legitimately based upon the Constitutional roles of the state and federal government. I believe there is no Constitutional provision that suggests the federal government has a role to play in preventing states, or punishing states, over laws with regards to medical marijuana. I believe absolutely there is a role for the federal government for punishing states or laws when they contravene federal jurisdiction. For instance, protecting states against invasion. Immigration is federal policy, and there’s a law actually called “Encouragement”: you can’t encourage people to come in illegally or stay here illegally. I believe that is constitutionally a federal area. DS: If you had to support one of the Democratic candidates, which one would it be and why? :TT: Although I couldn’t vote for him, if I had to support one for a nominee it would be Obama, and I would do so because first, I believe we could beat him laughs, but secondly, and less cynically, I think it would be very good to have a black man, a good family man, and a very articulate man, to have him as a role model for a lot of black children in this country."
politics,"India At least thirteen bombs were set off in the northeastern state of Assam in India on Thursday. The blasts went off shortly before noon IST (UTC+5:30) at market places and government buildings in the state capital Guwahati and surrounding area. Reports say that so far 77 people have been confirmed killed and between 200 and 300 injured. 41 of the victims were in Guwahati, 21 in Kokrajhar and 15 in Barpeta. Assam has been the scene of separatist insurgencies for years, most notably by United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) which was outlawed by the Indian government in 1990. The Associated Press says over 10,000 people have died in separatist violence in the past decade. The ULFA has denied any involvement, reported the Press Trust of India. Instead, a previously unheard of group, calling itself Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen (ISF-IM) claimed responsibility in a text message to a television station. The message included a warning of future attacks. Later, people who were apparently upset about the bombings, started rioting in the streets of Guwahati and throwing stones at vehicles. They also torched at least two fire engines. Police shut down roads and implemented a curfew in response to the unrest. Shakeel Ahmad of the Ministry of Home Affairs said conditions in Assam were ""very volatile, the government was on high alert and, even then, this has happened."" In the past, the government has blamed similar attacks on Islamic militants based in nearby Bangladesh. Ban Ki-moon, the secretary-general of the United Nations condemned the attack in a statement. Ban conveyed ""sorrow and sympathy to the Government and people of India for the loss of life and destruction caused by today's series of bombings,"" in the statement which was released on Thursday."
politics,"On Wednesday, the lower house or State Assembly of the State Legislature of the US state of California passed a controversial new bill that would redefine marriage as the union between two people, as opposed to a man and a woman ( text). The California State Senate, the upper house, had already acceded to this. A critical swing vote came from Tom Umberg (D-Santa Ana) of Orange County, the second largest California county, which is predominantly conservative. He was ushered on by Senator Joe Dunn of the same constituency. The voting predominantly followed party lines, with no Republican supporting the bill and few Democrats opposing it . A spokeswoman for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says he will veto the bill ""out of respect for the will of the people"" in the approval of Proposition 22, which opposed recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages."
politics,"2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict One week has passed since Israel responded to a Hezbollah attack along the Lebanon-Israel border. There is no immediate end of the conflict in sight as Israeli airborne, naval and ground units have pounded a wide array of targets in Lebanon. Hezbollah in turn has launched rocket and missile attacks on northern Israel. The Lebanese PM Fouad Siniora condemned Israel saying their attacks have been ""opening the gates of hell and madness"". He reiterated the Lebanese government position, urging Hezbollah to release Israeli soldiers, and calling on Israel to cease its attacks, terming them ""disproportionate"". However, an Israeli general said that the offensive could go on for weeks to come. Israeli PM Ehud Olmert claimed that last week's kidnappings were a timed attempt to divert attention from Iran's nuclear programme. The Rapporteur of Iran's Majlis' National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Kazem Jalali dismissed the allegation, denying any such role. The civilian population in Lebanon has taken the largest toll in the conflict; 200 Lebanese civilians have been reported to be killed in the past seven days, 30 of them today. As a result of Hezbollah fire, at least 24 Israelis have been reported killed, including 9 civilians at the Haifa train station. In addition, 30 Lebanese soldiers have died without engaging Israeli units. Eleven of them were killed today in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese army base east of Beirut. A Lebanese barracks was also hit yesterday, killing several soldiers. The United Nations want an international peace contingent to be stationed in southern Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from firing missiles into Israel. The force would act as a stabilisation force against attacks from both sides in the conflict. 500,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the violence which could end in a humanitarian disaster, UN said. A UN team was in Israel today, holding talks with the Israeli FM about a possible ceasefire agreement. However, the minister reiterated Israel's ultimatum that its two soldiers should be released and the Lebanese government posts troops in southern Lebanon before agreeing on a ceasefire. Lebanon say they fear posting soldiers in it's southern region could spark a civil war in the country. Hezbollah militants have also today fired rockets on towns in northern Israel. Haifa, Acre, Kiryat Shemona and the region of Gush Halav have been hit. One Israeli was killed. Hezbollah have made comparisons between the Israeli ""enemy combatants"" they are holding without trial, and the inmates of Guantanamo Bay who they say have a similar status. Today, transport trucks were again targeted by warplanes. Israel says it believed that the trucks were transporting missiles for Hezbollah. The Israeli military say 750 Hezbollah rockets, missiles and mortars have so far been fired since the start of the crisis. Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Lebanon by any available transportation. Ships, helicopters and buses have been used by several European countries and the United States to ferry their citizens out of the country."
politics,"After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded. To help solve these problems, the United Nations this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters. ""We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters,"" said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9. Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. ""We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much,"" he said. ""Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."" The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands."
politics,"ChinaThe trial of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo started today in Beijing on the grounds of ""inciting subversion of state power"". The United States, European Union and rights groups have called the trial politically motivated and are calling for his release. In prison since 2008 after his arrest for co-writing about political reform, the 53-year-old faces fifteen years in prison if convicted. Foreign diplomats from more than a dozen countries and supporters were forbidden entry by police posted outside the court; even Liu's wife, Liu Xia, was not permitted to attend, although her brother and the dissendent's lawyer Shang Baojun, who expects a verdict by Friday, were allowed inside. China has called international criticism ""unacceptable"" and ignored calls for Liu's release. Rights group Human Rights Watch described the trial as ""a travesty of justice"". Its director for Asia, Sophie Richardson said that ""the only purpose of this trial is to dress up naked political repression in the trappings of legal proceedings … Liu's crimes are non-existent, yet his fate has been pre-determined."" Locals have turned up to voice their support, despite police presence. ""Long live democracy, long live Liu Xiaobo!"" cried Song Zaimin. ""I don't know him and I don't want to know him but I just support his heroic behaviour. We must stand up for our future."" The document co-written by Liu, known as Charter 08, calls for democratic change and more freedom. Signed by over 10,000 people, the petition states: ""We hope that our fellow citizens who feel a similar sense of crisis, responsibility, and mission, whether they are inside the government or not, and regardless of their social status, will set aside small differences to embrace the broad goals of this citizens' movement."" source=Human Rights Watch director Sophie RichardsonOne such signatory, human rights lawyer Teng Biao defended the charter. ""I have the right to express my opinions about society and politics,"" he said, adding that ""if Liu Xiaobo is sentenced, then we should also assume the same crime, and we should bear the same legal responsibility."" The charge of inciting subversion is commonly used to repress critics of the country's Communist Party, according to human rights groups."
politics,"On Wednesday in the US state of Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey signed the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, officially outlawing nearly all circumstances of abortion in the state. This bill passed the Senate of the state on Tuesday. Republican state representative Terri Collins who sponsored the bill remarked the bill was not enforceable under the current interpretation of the US Constitution established by the US Supreme Court ruling in the Roe v. Wade case. Terri said the bill would become enforceable after the Supreme Court revisits the case. Apart from when the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, the bill provides for any terminations to potentially result in life sentence penalties. The bill has sparked controversy and protests. Planned Parenthood, along with the American Civil Liberties Union have announced their plans to oppose the bill by lawsuit. The governor tweeted her reasoning saying, ""Today, I signed into law the Alabama Human Life Protection Act. To the bill’s many supporters, this legislation stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians’ deeply held belief that every life is precious &amp; that every life is a sacred gift from God."""
politics,"USAWashington, D.C. - The Environmental Protection Agency may have a new tool in its arsenal to fight global warming. The agency has submitted a proposal to the Obama administration which aims to list carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The policy had previously been proposed to and rejected by the Bush administration, which said it was the wrong tool to be using. The proposal lists the negative effects of global warming, including longer and hotter heat waves, increased flooding, and the increased spread of diseases due to warmer weather. EPA administrator Lisa Jackson has previously suggested declaring global warming a health threat, and that the agency could use the 1970 Clean Air Act to use to combat it. Environmental groups applauded the finding, with the director of Clean Air Watch, Frank O'Donnell, calling it ""a green-letter day for the environment."" One of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice presidents, William L. Kovacs, said if the the proposal is put into effect that it ""will be devastating to the economy."" It is unclear whether the Obama administration will go along with the proposal. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt commented that ""The president has made clear that to combat climate change, his strong preference is for Congress to pass energy security legislation that includes a cap on greenhouse gas emissions."" No specific timeline has been given for when a decision would be made. An upcoming conference in Copenhagen, Denmark will focus on drawing up a new international global warming treaty, which the United States plans to attend, a clear reversal from the Bush administration's non-participation in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol."
politics,"2020 United States presidential election The following is the sixth and final edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories. This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Free and Equal Elections Foundation holds two presidential debates, three candidates who did not participate in those debates give their final pleas to voters, and three political pundits give their predictions on the outcome of the election. Polls at the start of the final full month on the campaign trail showed Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics average, 50.1 to 42.9 percent. October started with a surprise for the electorate. After it was revealed his aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, President Trump himself, his wife Melania, and son Barron all tested positive for the virus. Trump was said to be suffering ""minor symptoms"", and was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital as a precaution. Video captured Trump wearing a mask while walking to Marine One en route to the hospital. Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as well as the anti-viral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone. His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine. After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House. He tweeted, ""Don't be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life."" A couple days after Trump’s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page. Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected. In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, ""Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions. Politico regarded the debate as ""markedly more civil"" than the prior Trump-Biden debate. The next day, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate. In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC. Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC. With the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett looming, the issue of Court packing returned. Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing. Biden said voters ""don't deserve"" to know his position. A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony. Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus. Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in Sanford, Florida. At the rally, Trump declared himself ""immune"" and offered to kiss members of the crowd. White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days. In another potential ""October surprise,"" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the New York Post published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. According to the Post, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner. E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged influence peddling. Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company Burisma, on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired. The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act. Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and Michael Hayden, signed a letter saying the Post'&amp;zwj;s report ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" Current Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said the information was ""not part of some Russian disinformation campaign."" According to The Washington Post, intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the Post story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform. Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively. While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by Savannah Guthrie, on the main network as well as MSNBC and CNBC, ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with George Stephanopoulos for two hours. The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper The Hill described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the Qanon conspiracy theory and defended his pandemic policies. At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory. On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question. Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate. Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead. At this time, he made critical remarks about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl, that Trump claimed was unfair. Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer Sacha Baron Cohen may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop. Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director Christopher Wray held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election. Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020. Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a New York Times story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States. Just before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them. He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the Nashville, Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC News. Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation. Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious ""big guy"" who received a cut of money, Trump said, ""You're the big man, I think."" Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum. Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19. Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as xenophobic. He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are ""learning to live"" with the virus. Biden countered that people are instead ""learning to die"" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan. He proposed a public option and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare. Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip Medicare and Social Security. He vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health coverage. When asked about climate change, Trump claimed carbon emissions have been lower during his administration and argued against re-entering the Paris Climate Accord. Biden argued that green energy can provide good paying jobs. Trump accused Biden of previously saying he wanted to ban hydraulic fracturing. Biden denied, though Trump said it is on tape. Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website. Welker brought up the separation of immigrant families at the border. Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid ""millions of dollars"" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on oil and gas when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence. Welker received near-universal praise for her performance. Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first. In the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others. Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause. At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby. Biden referred to the people as ""chumps."" At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as ""ugly folks."" Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer. The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on. The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel. This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months. The fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: ""we cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death."" President Trump called it a ""terrible event"" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence. Category Two Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Louisiana coast. Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina. The anonymous insider who wrote New York Times op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor. The Trump campaign described Taylor as ""just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him"". The Commerce department released a report showing growth in GDP of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020. This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950. Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases. Biden described the growth as not ""nearly enough."" At the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent. The Free and Equal Elections Foundation held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates. The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states. The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the Commission on Presidential Debates. Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper Kanye West were each invited but did not attend. Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce, Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins, Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee Brian Carroll, and Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva. All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director Christina Tobin moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate. The debates used the format the League of Women voters developed when they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates. At the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the War in Afghanistan, approval and rank choice voting, national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the War on Drugs, vaccinations, gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of The Center for Election Science, Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor Sean Stone, SpaceX co-founder Jim Cantrell, indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner Ross Ulbricht. The debate closed with final statements from each candidate. In opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as ""pro-life"" and said climate change must be addressed. Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed capitalism as the root of all the nation's ills. Blankenship offered US$1 million to Hunter Biden to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the Green New Deal and the Economic Bill of Rights. The candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that could arise from a hasty withdrawal. While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world. Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and ""diluting"" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting. La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years. Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of ""rigged polls"" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a ""felon"" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic. Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to Defund the Police while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers. Pierce and Carroll endorsed charter schools, though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams. La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals. Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts. Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users. Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm. Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's RNA and turns them into ""genetically modified humans."" Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses. La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights. On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war. In closing, Pierce urged voters to ""vote their conscience."" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation. Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy. Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit. At the final debate held October 24 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist Adam Kokesh, Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist G. Edward Griffin, Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of RepresentUS, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News, and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates. With Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage. In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages. Pierce professed himself ""deeply concerned"" about the future of the US and endorsed using ""life"", ""liberty"", and ""happiness"" as the measure of success. Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons. He noted that the doomsday clock is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces. He found it curious he was called a ""Democratic socialist"" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for The American Conservative. Like the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates. La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the Citizens United decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of Citizens United. Hawkins attacked the ""macho culture"" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the Vietnam War and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a ""horrible"" use of the working class. She called the Korean War a ""genocidal war."" Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea. He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea. Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used. Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction. Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech. La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts. Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the Federal Reserve. Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve. Carroll argued that trade deals like NAFTA have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the 14th Amendment to remove corporations from its protection. Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the open primary system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two. Pierce claimed Abraham Lincoln was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals. Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs ""visionary leadership."" La Riva argued against Universal Basic Income (UBI), proposing minimum wage be increased to US$20 an hour. Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI. He named his economic view as distributism, which he said was an extreme form of capitalism. Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs. Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card. Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary. In conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under. Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination. Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a ""failed state."" He urged voters to vote for what they want. Wikinews provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters. Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins, and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons. File:Jo_Jorgensen_portrait_1_(crop_1).jpg|Jo JorgensenJo Jorgensen for President File:PhilCollins.webp|Phil CollinsProhibition Party File:Bill-Hammons-head-shot-president (Wikinews).jpg|Bill HammonsBill Hammons I'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal. To dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, ""There is a real party of peace and justice."" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold."" To small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, ""There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility."" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold."" My final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol. I tell them that we care about other issues. We support a balanced budget. We're pro-life and pro-gun rights. It is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era. The 12th Amendment outlines that the top three finishers in the Electoral College receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic. I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience. Wikinews asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the Electoral college tally of the 2020 presidential election. The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented Colorado's 6th congressional district as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com. File:Tom Tancredo, official Congressional photo cropped.jpg|Tom Tancredo US Congress File:Tomknapp.jpg|Thomas Knapp Avens O'Brien File:RonGunzburger.jpg|Ron Gunzburger Ron Gunzburger In addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. During his run he spoke to Wikinews in an exclusive interview. Afterwards, Tancredo ran for Governor of Colorado in 2010 as the nominee of the Constitution Party, finishing the race in second place. He later returned to the Republican Party. Tancredo predicts President Trump wins re-election over former Vice President Biden with an electoral count of 362 to 176. In 2008, Knapp stood as the first vice presidential nominee of the Boston Tea Party, which disbanded in 2012. Historian Darcy Richardson picked Knapp as his running mate for his 2016 campaign for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. Knapp runs the politics blog KN@PPSTER and is the director and senior news analyst of The William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism. Knapp predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 319 to 219. Gunzburger, a trial lawyer since 1988, founded the nonpartisan Politics1.com in 1997. He currently serves as senior advisor to Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan. According to Twitter, he describes himself as a centrist Democrat. Gunzburger predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 359 to 179."
politics,"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will formally present a plan this morning to the UN General Assembly when it meets in New York later today. The plan, entitled In Larger Freedom, is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year. If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the Security Council, and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member Human Rights Commission. The Canadian ambassador to the UN, Allan Rock, was the first diplomat to officially respond by saying, ""A lot of hard work lies ahead but we are optimistic."" Oxfam, Amnesty International, and other NGOs, have come out in support of the plan."
politics,"In a televised press statement at 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) today, President of the United States George W. Bush announced that he was appointing John R. Bolton to the position of the United States' ambassador to the United Nations. Stating that Mr. Bolton had received support from ""a majority of Senators"", but had been ""unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserved"" by the ""delaying tactics of a few"", Mr. Bush announced that the post had stood vacant for long enough during what he termed ""a war"", and that he was ""exercising his constitutional authority"" to make the appointment. ""This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform,"" Bush said during an announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Bolton appeared with him and spoke briefly. ""I am profoundly grateful and deeply humbled,"" Bolton said. ""It will be a distinct privilege to be an advocate for America's values and interests at the U.N."" The President can make an appointment without the approval of the Senate while the Congress is in recess, but the term of such a ""recess appointment"" expires at the end of the Congressional session. The next session begins January 3, 2007. The move comes despite a letter to the President last week saying that Mr. Bolton was ""not truthful"" while answering questions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, and should not be given a recess appointment. The New York Times reports the letter was signed by 36 senators -- 35 Democrats and one Independent. Some senators, including Republicans, have raised questions regarding Mr. Bolton's history of criticizing the United Nations, his treatment of subordinates, and over charges that he has tried to influence intelligence assessments to conform to his views, the Times reports. During confirmation hearings, Republican Senator George Voinovich described Bolton as ""the poster child of what someone in the diplomatic corps should not be."" Because of Voinovich's opposition, Bolton's nomination was sent to the floor of the Senate without a recommendation. ""At a time when we need to reassert our diplomatic power in the world, President Bush has decided to send a seriously flawed and weakened candidate to the United Nations,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""The reason Bolton is being recess appointed is because the president chose to stonewall the Senate. Mr. Bolton could have had his up or down vote had President Bush given senators the information they needed. Instead, Bolton arrives at the United Nations with a cloud hanging over his head."" ""The president has done a real disservice to our nation by appointing an individual who lacks the credibility to further U.S. interests at the United Nations. I will be monitoring his performance closely to ensure that he does not abuse his authority as he has in the past,"" said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ""We will work with him as the ambassador and representative of the president and the government,"" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. ""We look forward to working with him, as I do with the other 190 ambassadors"". Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas praised the president for using his authority ""to end the obstruction against John Bolton."" Cornyn said, ""This is an important position and it's critical that it not remain vacant any longer. Bolton is exceptionally well qualified to fill this role at this time."" original reporting"
politics,"The People's Republic of China has commuted the death sentence of a prominent Tibetan monk, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, ordering him instead to spend the rest of his life in prison. In 2002, a Chinese court found Tenzin Delek Rinpoche guilty of involvement in a series of terrorist bombings earlier that year in a region of Sichuan province historically part of Tibet, and of inciting separatist activities. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was then postponed for two years. Upon the expiration of his suspended sentence late last year, Chinese officials suggested they might go ahead with the execution. It was to have taken place last month. But Higher People's Court of Sichuan decided to commute the sentence, saying the monk had obeyed certain conditions that were not disclosed. Officials say he confessed to the bombing, a claim human rights advocates say they do not believe. Tenzin Deleg, who is widely respected among Tibetan Buddhists, has said he was wrongly accused. Anne Callahan, manager of the Free Tibet campaign in Britain, says Communist officials targeted the spiritual leader because they viewed his vast following as a threat to their authority among the large community of ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan province. She says her group believes the real reason for the reprieve of the death sentence was the international pressure brought on Beijing by governments and private organizations. ""The reality is that his case generated a whole international campaign on his behalf and has actually highlighted the degree of religious repression in Sichuan now,"" she said. The reprieve came exactly two years after the execution of another man, Lobsang Dhondup, who was tried and convicted along with Tenzin Delek for the 2002 bombings. The Dalai Lama and his Tibetan government in exile, along with several human rights groups, had called for the sentence to be reversed. The United States expressed serious concern about the monk's closed-door trial, saying Chinese authorities failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of guilt. The issue came up during visits to Beijing by Secretary of State Powell and other high-ranking Bush Administration officials. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing had no immediate comment following the news of the court's decision. Meanwhile, Tashi Phuntsog, described as Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's ""right-hand man,"" walks free. He was released earlier this month after being detained since 2002, 10 days after Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche. The government never said why Tashi Phuntsog was jailed or why he was released early. Human Rights Watch, calling on the Communist government to explain Tashi Phuntsog's detention believes he was released needing medical attention. ""Tashi Phuntsog entered prison as a healthy man in his early 40s, and he was cast out literally as a broken man,"" it said. Xinhua reports he has been ""well and fairly treated."""
politics,"SomaliaIn ongoing clashes that started Tuesday in Somalia, Islamist rebels Al-Shabaab battled troops from the African Union's peacekeeping force, African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). According to rights groups and other sources, 81 people have been killed. Among them are 48 civilians, said the Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation. Another 90 civilians have been injured, the group added. On Sunday, Al-Shabaab attacked Burundi troops with suicide bombers at an AMISOM base in Mogadishu. 11 troops were killed and 15 wounded. Xuddur, the capital of Bakool, is reported to have fallen under Al-Shabaab control. ""Al-Shabaab fighters are now patrolling the town and the other group fled,"" local elder Hussein Abdi Isak told Reuters in a phone interview. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement to ""condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on the African Union mission in Somalia."" The statement was passed unanimously and urges all Somalis ""to reject violence and extremism."" ""This is a kind of setback, no doubt about it, but this is not the time to despair,"" the President of the United Nations Security Council, Japan's Ambassador Yukio Takasu, told reporters. ""On the contrary, I think all of us have much stronger determination to continue to provide and accelerate the logistical support to AMISOM."" The African Union says its peacekeeping force in Somalia — which is supposed to number 8,000, but currently has about 3,500 soldiers from Uganda and Burundi — is in dire need of reinforcement. However, Nigeria, which was supposed to send 850 officers and soldiers within weeks, says it now has second thoughts. ""At the time the commitment was made to go to Somalia, what was on ground was peacekeeping,"" Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe said. ""But the situation in Somalia has deteriorated considerably. We are not in a hurry to start getting the body bags to this country."" ""If we are going to risk the lives of our young men and women, if we are going to put our young men and women in harm's way, it has to be a carefully analyzed mission response. It should not be without adequate planning and it should not be without adequate logistical, material support,"" he added."
politics,"Activist groups in the Philippines led by Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (New Patriotic Alliance) or Bayan are set to submit ""cabinet level documents"" as evidence to international bodies purportedly showing that the office of the President, Malacañang sanctioned the series of extrajudicial killings in the country. The evidence is to be presented to the Permanent People's Tribunal and the United Nations Special Rapporteurs, which is scheduled to visit the country this year. In a press statement, Bayan expressed disappointment with the report of the Melo Commission saying that ""the report merely tells us what we already know, and that the report stops short of finding the roots of the extra-judicial killings."" ""Everyone knows that Palparan is involved in the killings,"" said Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes Jr., asking that ""why is it that after Palparan retired in September 2006, the killings continued?"" Reyes concluded that ""this only shows that the killings go beyond Palparan. We have repeatedly said that there is a national policy involved which sanctions the assassination of activists. The Melo Commission seems to have conveniently ignored this reality and has limited its report to Palparan's responsibility and shielded the administration from any culpability."" The documents, Reyes said, detail a ""step-by-step matrix"" on how to ""neutralize"" legal organizations. He added that the document was presented to the Arroyo Cabinet. Meanwhile, the group challenged Malacañang to abide by the fact-finding commission's recommendation to file charges against retired Major General Jovito Palparan and other military field commanders for their involvement in the killings. He also said President Arroyo, as commander-in-chief, should ""take responsibility for the killings."" Human rights group Karapatan recorded more than 700 leftist activists, farmers, community organizers and journalists killed since Mrs. Arroyo came to power in 2001. The latest victim, Dominador L. De Luna, 51, an employee of the National Food Authority (NFA) in Samar, was gunned down just when the necrological mass for Jose Maria Cui, a professor at University of Eastern Philippines who was shot in front of his students, was being held last January 29. Dita Indah Sari, head of the National Front for the Indonesian Labor Struggle and 2001 recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award for emerging leadership, yesterday said the Philippine government should implement the recommendation of the Melo Commission to hold top generals responsible for the assassination of hundreds of leftist activists. Just like in Indonesia, the Philippine government, according to her, seemed afraid to take its military brass to account on the basis of command responsibility. She said international pressure was imperative at this point to move concerned governments to make appropriate moves regarding human rights cases based on recommendations by a fact-finding body. ""The international pressure will humiliate the government,"" Sari added. Making one general accountable would not solve the extrajudicial killings in the country, according to America Vera-Zavala of Sweden's Left International Forum. ""I'm quite sure this extreme number of people killed is not due to one single general. It would be a unique country if only one general is responsible for all this,"" she said. Vera-Zavala said the European Union was aware of the series of killings in the country and was continuing to monitor the matter. In a related report, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo yesterday said she would ask the European Union to assist in the commission's work, declaring that she had ""no tolerance for human rights violations."" She issued a statement containing detailed instructions after meeting with retired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo in Malacañang. The instructions were not clear though on how she intended to address the latter's recommendation to hold Palparan accountable for the killings. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Gen. Hermogenes Esperon Jr. said Palparan could be brought to court if indeed there is evidence. ""But since he is already retired, we cannot take him under our jurisdiction,"" Esperon added. ""The Melo Commission failed in its public vow to get to the bottom of the killings: its report, based on Justice Melo's statement to the media, is indicative of a whitewash,"" Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Satur Ocampo said in reaction to Melo's statements. He disclosed plans of filing a case against retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan with the International Criminal Court, ""for command responsibility under international humanitarian law."" ""Melo is silent on GMA's (President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's) role. The killings go on even with Palparan out, so what has the commission accomplished?"" Ocampo said in a phone interview. In a text message, Rep. Teodoro Casiño, also of Bayan Muna, said ""the report merely scratches the surface and tells us what we already know."" He said the Melo Commission missed the whole point because ""the institution of policies on counterinsurgency like Oplan Bantay Laya are crucial in allowing the likes of Palparan to wreak terror on a national scale."" Anakpawis party-list Rep. Rafael Mariano said the Melo Commission had ""consciously avoided the responsibility of the President, the Cabinet Oversight Committee on Internal Security and the counterinsurgency program Oplan Bantay Laya in its report."" ""Like we said before, the Melo Commission is a whitewashing machine,"" he said. Mariano also said ""the killings of activists was integral to the Arroyo administration's counterinsurgency policy,"" predicting that ""the killings won't stop as long as the mastermind is not punished."" His colleague in Anakpawis, Rep. Crispin Beltran, who is still detained for rebellion charges, saw in the Melo report a move to make it ""appear that it was a mere matter of negligence of command that set off the spate of extrajudicial killings."" Ocampo emphasized their ""demand that Malacañang immediately make public the full 89-page report for scrutiny by all parties, including the media."" ""The Melo Commission must adhere to established UN protocols and Amnesty International's recommendations on such an independent commission."""
politics,"Toowoomba. I have a broad range of experiences that I can bring to the role of federal MP anchor=Australia. When approached by the Sustainable Australia Party to run and help to raise awareness for our party, I was very happy to contribute. ::I believe that the Groom by-election offers voters an opportunity to send a message to the two major parties that we're not happy with business as usual politics &amp;mdash; including rampant overdevelopment and systemic political corruption that negatively impacts on the environment. WNIQ: You've said that you want to act on climate change &amp;mdash; what would your plan be? ::Sandra Jephcott: There is no silver bullet to addressing climate change. Sustainable Australia Party has a anchor=Adjective plan to act on climate change, including: ::* Funding and subsidising research and development into renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives; ::* Net zero or net negative Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (or ideally sooner); ::* Imposing a moratorium on all new coal mines in Australia such as Adani (and all major coal mine expansions such as New Acland) ::* Imposing a anchor=Noun on all new fracking, including for coal seam gas; ::* Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies; ::* Adopting a globally-consistent carbon pricing mechanism that does not unfairly penalise Australian industries; ::* Promoting the environmental benefits of plant-based food; ::* and Lowering population growth pressures. WNIQ: What do you think needs to be done in Toowoomba to properly protect the environment and water? ::Sandra Jephcott: Despite holding a Carnival of Flowers each year, Toowoomba came in last nationally for its resident's access to green space. It is therefore important that areas in and around Toowoomba &amp;mdash; including Mt Lofty &amp;mdash; are protected and where possible expanded. Housing sprawl and density is a key contributor to destroying tree canopy and green space, so stopping overdevelopment is a key priority. ::In terms of water, we need to better manage Toowoomba's water security, including through lower wastage, an expansion of water tank usage and the revisiting of recycled water options. Strong action on climate change will also be vital to the long-term viability of Toowoomba's water supply. WNIQ: What are your thoughts on the COVID-19 response plan federally from the Morrison government? ::Sandra Jephcott: Overall, the Morrison Government's response has been reasonable, after initially being very reluctant to prioritise health and well-being over economic growth. Also, there were major gaps in coverage for affected workers and industries. For example, casual workers and the arts were not adequately supported throughout the pandemic. WNIQ: Why did you decide to join Sustainable Australia? ::Sandra Jephcott: I come from a science background. It was very important to me that Sustainable Australia Party is from the political centre with an evidence-based, science-based approach to policy. For example, Sustainable Australia Party is the only party in my view with a holistic plan to address our various environmental crises. It was important for me that this plan not only includes strong action on climate change but also stabilising population in Australia and globally. WNIQ: Why do you think that foreign ownership of farms, housing and land is an important issue to combat? ::Sandra Jephcott: Australia is a sovereign nation. We need to be able to both manage our natural resources sustainably and ensure that we maintain profits, jobs and taxes in Australia for the well-being of Australians. Selling off our resources undermines our capacity to achieve these very important economic, environmental and social objectives. WNIQ: How have COVID-19 restrictions impacted your ability to campaign? ::Sandra Jephcott: I've been able to comfortably work at early voting centres and do media interviews, so there has not been much restriction at all. WNIQ: What's one key issue in Groom that you think needs acting on? ::Sandra Jephcott: Sustainable Australia Party has three big priorities in this by-election: Protect our environment; Stop overdevelopment; Stop corruption. But number one is protecting our environment, including strong action on climate change. Of the four parties running &amp;mdash; the others being Labor, Liberal National and Liberal Democrats &amp;mdash; only Sustainable Australia Party advocates for a moratorium on all new coal mines and major coal mine expansions. Locally, this means no to the proposed expansion of New Acland Mine on the Darling Downs. clear"

A South Korean Foreign Ministry official on Saturday stated that Seoul has proposed five-way talks with the U.S., China, Russia and Japan to find a way to deal with the threats given by North Korea. The United States and Japan agreed to attend the 5-way talks but China and Russia have yet to respond.

The report also mentioned economic loss suffered by the country, that reached 7.754 billion dollars, leaving 71 percent of the Haitians in extreme poverty. The document was diffused in Santo Domingo de Guzmán, between the preparatives of a conference about the reconstruction of Haiti, that will take place next March 11 in New York.

politics,"One day after Jon Stanhope, the Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister, posted a confidential draft of the proposed Australian anti-terror bill to his website, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock claims that modifications have been made. Prime Minister John Howard denies that the changes are more than ""minor"", and denies that the legislation is ""draconian"". The legislation, which will only be debated in Parliament for one day, has come under attack by members of parliament (including Senator Bob Brown), civil libertarians, Muslims' rights advocates, the Law Council of Australia and members of the community. Advocates of the proposed legislation claim that the laws are an extension of the existing criminal code. They also claim that Australia is in danger of a terrorist attack, such as the 7 July London bombings. Others have pointed out that the London bombers were not previously known to police and would not have been impacted by this legislation. Western Australian Opposition Leader and Member for Kalgoorlie Matt Birney said ""Look, let's just remember there are lunatics running around the place blowing people up and we need to take these extraordinary measures to deal with what is no doubt an extraordinary period of time in our history"". Prime Minister Howard defended the proposed legislation. He claimed that the laws had ""minor"" modifications (to the ""leaked"" document) but they were essentially the same. ""What is going to be in that legislation is what I announced and the states agreed to – no more, no less,"" Mr Howard told the Nine Network. ""I announced that we were going to have preventative detention, I announced that we were going to have control orders, I announced that we would be expanding the sedition offence to include incitement of violent behaviour against the community."" ""All of those things have been out in the public domain. ""Now obviously people are entitled to have a look at the final form of the legislation and they will, but this idea that we have snuck in a whole lot of attacks on civil liberties beyond what I announced is completely wrong."" ""We are not trying to sneak anything through under the cover of the COAG agreement."" ""Given the circumstances in which we live, they're not draconian. They are unusual but we live in unusual circumstances."" Waleed Kadous of the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network spoke against the proposed laws. He expressed concern that the proposed ""shoot to kill"" laws were too permissive, and could allow an innocent suspect to be such. He said that the ""devil is in the detail and there are plenty of devils in this legislation"". ""Frankly we are disappointed, because while the Prime Minister said there would be lots of safeguards, there don't appear to be that many."" ""We are concerned police can shoot to kill without a crime being committed and that you can be held in preventative detention for 24 hours before you even see a judge."" Even a former Liberal prime minister has used a major speech in Melbourne to outline his concerns about the legislation. Mr Malcom Fraser says it provides no real safeguards to protect rights. Mr Fraser says these laws do not belong in a democracy, and is particularly concerned about control orders. ""These are powers whose breadth and arbitrary nature, with a lack of judicial oversight, should not exist in any democratic country,"" he said. Mr Fraser insists there is not enough protection. ""There are no real safeguards, there is no adequate official review,"" he said. ""The law should be opposed because the process itself is seriously flawed. ""Instead of a wide-ranging discussion, the Government has sought to nobble the field in secret and to prevent debate."" Liberal backbencher Petro Georgiou has expressed reservations about the package, calling for an independent watchdog to monitor the new powers. Three international law experts have also criticised the proposed laws. *date=October 15, 2005"
politics,"On Tuesday, the Governor of the US state of Arizona Doug Ducey signed into law a bill banning abortion if sought solely because of a foetus' genetic abnormality. Senate Bill 1457, which stalled twice for criticism by opponents of abortion, passed both chambers of the Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature last week in a party-line vote, amended twice along the way to alleviate concerns by two hesitant Republicans. The bill makes it a Class 6 felony, the least severe, to seek or perform an abortion ""because of a genetic abnormality of the child"", defined as ""the presence or presumed presence of an abnormal gene expression in an unborn child"", but not a ""severe fetal abnormality"" considered ""incompatible with life."" Intimidating someone to get an abortion and soliciting or accepting monies to finance an abortion for this purpose has been made a Class 3 felony. The bill also allows the unborn child's father or, in case the mother is under 18, a maternal grandparent to sue, as well as including the applicability of state law to ""an unborn child at every stage of development"", which Senator Kirsten Engel and Representative Melody Hernandez wrote in a submitted minority report ""would open up the potential for prosecutors to charge persons including the pregnant individual whose conduct results in a woman having a miscarriage with murder, manslaughter or child endangerment."" Other provisions of the bill includes a prohibition on the distribution ""via courier, delivery or mail service"" of abortion-inducing drugs, a ban on any public educational institution from performing or aiding non-life saving abortion, a ban on the use of public or tax monies paid by the state or students for university research involving foetal remains or somatic cell nuclear transfer, or any state money towards organisations providing abortion care, and requiring all foetal remains to be buried or cremated. KYMA-DT reported Ducey is an anti-abortion rights governor who ran on the Republican ballot and has never vetoed anti-abortion legislation. In a statement, Duckey said, ""there's immeasurable value in every single life — regardless of genetic makeup ... We will continue to prioritize protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives."" The news release, originally published on his website also read, ""with this legislation, Arizona remains among the top pro-life states in the nation."" Senator Nancy Barto said, according to the release ""we need to protect our most vulnerable, especially those with treatable genetic conditions ... They are loved, integral members of our community that make Arizona whole"". Cathi Herrod, president of Center for Arizona Policy said in her own news release, according to the Associated Press ""today, Arizonans win."" Representative Diego Espinoza wrote in a tweet, ""I'm disappointed to see Arizona moving in this direction, ignoring the needs and desires of doctors, women, and families for an extreme political agenda."" Representative and House Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding wrote in a statement ""it's disturbing and wrong that the legislature is not focusing on policies to help women, and instead is stripping away the fundamental freedom to choose if, when, and how to start or grow a family."" In a letter shared to a Facebook post, the union United Campus Workers at Arizona State University urged last Saturday to the Arizona Board of Regents, university president Michael M. Crow and University of Arizona president Robert D. Robbins to ""immediately speak out against SB 1457"", calling it ""a blatant attack on reproductive freedom""."
politics,"Zimbabwe police broke up a prayer rally protesting government policy on Sunday, arresting over 100 people, including the leader of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai. Zimbabwe police claimed that the prayer rally violated a government ban on political protests. Riot police reinforcements cordoned off the area where the rally was to be held, and searched cars as they entered. As political leaders approached the area, they were reportedly pulled out of their cars and detained. Witnesses reported heavily armed military police forces surrounding the area of Highfields, the suburb where the rally was to be held. Police fatally shot one person, after being reportedly attacked by a large mob of protesters. A spokesman for one of the men arrested claimed that a lawyer was beaten and chased away from the Machipisa police station in Highfields, where the arrested people were being held. Opponents of President Robert Mugabe have blamed him for food shortages, repression of people's rights, and failing to control Zimbabwe's record inflation of over 1600%. A spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said the Secretary-General condemned the reported beating of the leaders, and that he urged their release."
politics,"The Australian government has been keeping quiet about a UN committee's repeated criticism of its record on race issues. A report issued over two weeks ago by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has not received comment from the government in the media, and domestic media coverage has been scant, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, and confirmed by a search of news search engine news.google.com. According to Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) National Director David Cooper before the case was heard by the UN committee, ""We fully expect the government is going to deflect it by criticising the UN process."" In fact, this criticism was given in the session, and nothing has been heard from the Australian Federal Government since, on the committee hearing and report. After reciting a list of Australian anti-racism initiatives, ambassador to the UN Mike Smith, described the 18 committee members' work in the previous session five years ago as ""cursory"" and ""unreasonable"". He said they had largely ignored progress being made in Australia, yet displayed ""an unquestioning acceptance"" of critics of the Government. Regis de Gouttes of France called Mr Smith ""exceptionally rude"". Jose Lindgren Alves of Brazil told him, ""As a veteran diplomat, this statement, with its language describing programs and attacks on NGOs, reminds me of the sort of statement from communist bloc countries and Latin American dictatorships that Australia used to condemn."" The committee was positive about a number of improvements in race-related issues in Australia over the five years since its last report. These were, * the criminalising of acts and incitement of racial hatred in most Australian States and Territories * progress in the economic, social and cultural rights by indigenous peoples * commitment of state and federal governments to work together on the issues * programmes and practices among the police and the judiciary, aimed at reducing the number of indigenous juveniles entering the criminal justice system * the abolition of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory * the adoption of a Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society to ensure that government services are provided in a way that is sensitive to the language and cultural needs of all Australians * and the numerous human rights education programmes developed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC). However the report contained a large number of serious criticisms, and a reminder that the Convention prohibits direct as well as indirect discrimination. Australia was asked to report back on progress on a number of items within one year. The criticisms were, * that there was nothing to stop racially discriminative Commonwealth laws * proposed reforms to HREOC that may limit its independence and hinder its effectiveness at monitoring Australia's compliance with the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination * the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an elected body of indigenous representatives, the main policy-making body in Aboriginal affairs * a lack of legislation criminalising serious acts or incitement of racial hatred, in the Commonwealth, the State of Tasmania and the Northern Territory * that reported prejudice against Arabs and Muslims had increased * that counter-terrorism legislation may have an indirect discriminatory effect against Arab and Muslim Australians * reportedly biased treatment of asylum-seekers by the media * difficulty in gaining successful litigation under the Racial Discrimination Act in the absence of direct evidence * that no cases of racial discrimination, as distinct from racial hatred, have been successfully litigated in the Federal courts since 2001 * reversal since 1998 of progress made under 1993's Native Title Act and Mabo case, with new legal certainty for government and third parties provided at the expense of indigenous title * diverging perceptions between governmental authorities and indigenous peoples and others on the compatibility of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act with the Convention * that proof of continuous observance and acknowledgement of the laws and customs of indigenous peoples since the British acquisition of sovereignty over Australia is required to establish native title * very poor conditions of employment, housing, health, education and income for indigenous Australians, compared with non-indigenous * mandatory sentencing in Western Australia, which disproportionately impacts indigenous Australians * the ""striking over-representation"" of indigenous people in prison, and dying in custody * that indigenous women are the fastest growing prison population * allegations, accompanied by State denials, of discrimination in the grant of visas against Asian and Muslim people * Australia's mandatory detention of migrants determined to be illegal, including asylum-seekers, particularly when it affects women, children, unaccompanied minors, and the stateless * that many have been in detention for over three years * lack of access by many migrants and protected refugees to social security * precariousness of circumstances, and denial of right of family reunion, for many protected refugees * that the Federal Government has rejected most of the recommendations adopted by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation given in 2000"
politics,"In their annual report on human rights Amnesty International Secretary General, Irene Khan, said ""Guantanamo has become the gulag of our time."" In this 308-page report, they also called for the United States to shut down the Guantanamo prison. The report continues the critical analysis of the actions of the U.S. government, but criticism is sharper. The introduction to the report states ""The 'war on terror' appeared more effective in eroding international human rights principles than in countering international 'terrorism'."" In calling for changes from the U.S. government, especially regarding Guantanamo Bay, Amnesty International's voice is joined with calls from both the International Red Cross (IRC) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an. The ACLU's Freedom of Information Act requests turned up U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reports which echo the IRC's concerns. The documents are purported to show a consistency with reports from detainees of abuse to their religious symbols, as well as reports of beatings and other interrogation methods. Amnesty International's Secretary General, in her introduction to the report, points to the United State's foreign and military policy as providing a justification for other governments to ignore human rights. ""The USA, as the unrivalled political, military and economic hyper-power, sets the tone for governmental behaviour worldwide. When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights, it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity,"" said Irene Khan. White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were ""ridiculous and unsupported by the facts. The United States is leading the way when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting human dignity. We have liberated 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have worked to advance freedom and democracy in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for minority rights, that women's rights are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot"", as well as supporting the fight against AIDS in Africa. About the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, ""We hold people accountable when there is abuse. We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in."""
politics,"LGBT A federal judge in San Francisco has ruled that California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state, violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. ""Plaintiffs challenge Proposition 8 under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" wrote U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker. ""Each challenge is independently meritorious, as Proposition 8 both unconstitutionally burdens the exercise of the fundamental right to marry and creates an irrational classification on the basis of sexual orientation."" Proposition 8, which was passed by California voters by referendum in November 2008, banned same-sex marriage in the state, which had been legal after a California Supreme Court ruling on May 15, 2008. The proposition's passage did not reverse the marriages of thousands of same-sex couples who had gotten married in the state in the interval. The case, Perry et al. v. Schwarzenegger et al., was heard by Chief Judge Walker. Anticipating a defeat, the pro-Proposition 8 coalition of ""defendant-intervenors"" filed this morning a ""motion for stay pending appeal"", asking the court for its ruling to not take effect unless the decision is upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals; both sides in the case say an appeal is inevitable. Speaking for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, Jennifer C. Pizer said, ""In holding that Prop 8 cannot stand because it violates the equal protection and due process rights of California’s lesbian and gay couples, this decision adds to the growing consensus in courts and legislatures across the country that there are no good reasons for excluding same-sex couples from marriage."" Courtenay Semel, an actress and LGBT activist, told Wikinews ""today marks another day in history! A big win for equal marriage. It's about time that progress is being made towards equality for all."""
politics,"The Canadian House of Commons has voted 175 to 123 to defeat a motion by the Conservative minority government to re-open the same-sex marriage debate. If the motion had passed the government would have proposed a bill to restore the traditional definition of marriage as being exclusively a union between a man and a woman. The Conservative and Liberal parties did not whip the vote allowing their MPs a free vote. The motion voted on read as follows: ""That this House call on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages."" Prime Minister Stephen Harper, 47, made holding the vote a key promise in the 2006 federal election campaign. About a dozen Conservative MPs, including several cabinet ministers voted against the motion in the free vote while about a dozen Liberal opposition MPs voted for the motion. No MPs for the opposition Bloc Quebecois and New Democratic Party voted in favour the motion although two members of the BQ did not vote because they were paired and a third was absent from the vote. ""We made a promise to have a free vote on this issue; we kept that promise, and obviously the vote was decisive and obviously we'll accept the democratic result of the people's representatives,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday at a news conference in Ottawa following the vote. ""I don't see reopening this question in the future."" The Liberals said that even if a new law banning same-sex marriage was passed it would be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. Constitutional lawyers say that the Tories would have to change the law by invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which Harper opposes doing. ""It was the wrong move to question the rights of the people and to try to override the Charter of rights...He must not be very proud of that,"" said Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion. High profile Tory cabinet ministers Peter MacKay, David Emerson, John Baird, Jim Prentice, Lawrence Cannon, and Josée Verne voted against the motion. House Speaker Peter Milliken, who is a Liberal, did not vote as the Speaker only votes to break a tie. Harper declared the matter closed, following the vote, ruling out the possibility of revisiting the issue. ""I don't see reopening this question in the future,"" the prime minister told reporters when asked if his government would reintroduce the motion after the next election should the Conservatives win a majority government. Same-sex marriage was legalized in 2005 by the former Liberal government lead by Paul Martin after a series of court rulings legalized same-sex marriage across most of the country. The 2005 legislation made Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize gay marriage. Over 12,000 gay couples have married in Canada since Bill C-38 passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, and Canada are currently the only countries that allow gay marriage.

politics,"SomaliaThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that, in the last month, 258 civilians were killed and a further 80,000 displaced by the ongoing violence in Somalia, between the government and rebel groups. ""According to local sources, intense clashes between government forces and militia groups fighting for control of the conflict- torn central regions have left at least 258 civilians dead and another 253 wounded, which makes January the deadliest month since last August,"" the UN agency said in a statement. ""We estimate that more than 80,000 Somalis have been displaced since the beginning of the year. Thousands were also forced to leave their homes in other parts of Somalia."" The violence has made it difficult for humanitarian aid workers to access the population effectively. Andrej Mahecic, the spokesman of the UN refugees agency, noted: ""So far, the deteriorating security conditions have made it hard, if not impossible, for humanitarian workers to access the needy population."" The Xinhua news agency reports that UNHCR intends to send relief and shelter supplies to upwards of 18,000 people in 27 locations, where displaced residents are living temporarily, when it is considered safe to do so. Among those displaced were 18,000 people who fled their homes in the capital, Mogadishu; meanwhile, 29,000 were displaced in Dhusamareebb, in the Galgaduud region, and 25,000 in Beledweyne in the Hiraan region. A total of 1.4 million Somalis are currently internally displaced, 560,000 more are refugees in adjacent countries; last year, 120,000 residents sought refuge, primarily in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Yemen. The UN says Somalia is in its worst humanitarian crisis for eighteen years."
politics,"Alexandermacpherson According to the North Korean government, a US citizen, Aijali Mahli Gomes, has attempted suicide in a North Korean prison. In April, Gomes was sentenced to eight years of hard labour for illegally attempting to cross into the reclusive country in January, though his reasons for doing so remain unclear. In addition to the prison term, the man was also fined the equivalent of US$700,000 for a ""hostile act"". ""Driven by his strong guilty conscience, disappointment and despair at the US government that has not taken any measure for his freedom, he attempted to commit suicide,"" the North's Korean Central News Agency reported. This report did not specify where and how Gomes attempted suicide, or his state at present, only adding that Gomes ""is now being given first-aid treatment at a hospital"", and that Swedish diplomats at their Pyongyang embassy who handle diplomatic affairs between the US and North Korea have been made aware of Gomes' condition. Gomes was an English teacher in South Korea before trying to cross into the North. Gomes had also attended rallies that supported human rights activist Robert Park, who crossed into the North to protest the Communist country's poor human rights record. Park was later expelled from North Korea 40 days after he entered. North Korea's international relations remain tense after the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, and this report was issued just hours before the United Nations Security Council was expected to pass a resolution censuring the explosion of the Cheonan. North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking of the warship and has declared that any sanctions from the international community will lead to war."
politics,"Yesterday, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to establish a United Nations Human Rights Council ""to promote and protect fundamental rights, and deal with major human rights offenders,"" according to a press release. 170 countries voted for the proposed resolution and four voted against (Israel, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the United States), with three abstentions (Belarus, Iran, and Venezuela). The Council will replace the Commission on Human Rights, which has lost credibility in past years due to politicization. The United States objected that the resolution did not go far enough to exclude from membership in the new Council those nations which it alleges are the worst human rights abusers. Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, the Cuban Ambassador, declared that a ""huge discredit"" had befallen the previous Commission due to the ""political manipulation, hypocrisy and double standards imposed on its work by the United States and the European Union."" The 191-member General Assembly approved the resolution, which stated ""members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, fully cooperate with the Council, and be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism, during their term of membership."" The resolution calls for elections for the new body on May 9, 2006 and an inaugural meeting on June 19, while the Commission will be abolished on June 16. The Council will consist of 47 members, each elected individually by a majority (96 members or more) of the General Assembly. If the Council members fail to uphold high standards of human rights, they can be suspended from the Council by a two-thirds majority of Assembly members present at the meeting."
politics,"FinlandOn March 4, 2008 a demonstration against censorship is planned to be held at the Finnish Parliament, part of the continuing controversy over the Finnish Internet child porn filter. The organizers of the demonstration expect at least two-hundred participants, with representatives of the digital rights organization Electronic Frontier Finland (Effi) and several political parties will also present. The controversy arose after the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) blacklisted censorship critic Matti Nikki's site. Matti Nikki himself is now under criminal investigation for aiding in the distribution of child pornography, as he published a large portion of the filtering blacklist on his still-censored website. MP Jyrki Kasvi has made an official inquiry in the Finnish Parliament on the matter, and Effi has filed an official complaint to the parliamentary ombudsman. The Finnish Minister of Communication, Suvi Lindén, and the NBI have been severely criticized over the filtering system, which has been under heavy scrutiny by the media. After stating that she will not tolerate discussion criticizing the filtering system, as the situation is not a matter of freedom of speech, a petition was signed by over 12,000 people demanding her resignation. This was accompanied by a Thai civil rights group questioning the blocking as child porn of a memorial site dedicated to a member of the Thai royal family. Eventually the NBI removed the memorial site from the blacklist, explaining that the DNS based system blocks only whole sites, and that there was child pornography site under the same domain; this raised questions about the efficiency of the filtering system. Lindén later admitted that she did not know the details of the filtering system, as it had been established by her predecessors, before the change of government in early 2007. She has nevertheless defended the system, citing the protection of children, but admitted that there are problems with the Finnish system, and in other countries with similar systems. The NBI have published a statement explaining their actions, at the request of Lindén. In it the NBI stated that there are filtered sites that do not contain any child pornography, but claimed that it was not their fault, rather a side effect of the system. They also noted that they are planning to address this issue by switching from a DNS based filter to a URL based system. According to a prominent Finnish expert of filtering technology, the planned URL filtering would cost least two million euros. This estimate comes at the same time that the government cut back funds for work against child abuse, causing further uproar. The NBI's official position is that they block pornographic sites where the actors look too young, and sites which link to these sites. The argument for the filtering is that there is a large amount of child pornography on the Internet, most of it based on servers in countries where the authorities are indifferent to the issue. The general opinion after analysis by multiple people is that the list of at least 1,700 sites contains a handful of actual child pornographic sites, most of which are not located in Western countries. However, some sites in the list are located in countries like the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany, and very few of those contain even questionable or borderline material. Dutch journalist Karin Spaink reviewed 40 sites on the list which were physically located in the Netherlands. She concluded that some of the sites have illegal child pornography, and that four of those are also blocked in the Netherlands by their equivalent filtering system. She estimated that about half of the 40 did not contain any illegal material. Effi's response to the NBI's statement was that the issue with censorship is not technical but that it has no place in an open, democratic society."
politics,"As the US Senate is about to take its annual August recess, they have not yet taken action on the controversial United Nations ambassador nomination of John Bolton. With Congress gone and President Bush at his ranch in Texas, White House press secretary Scott McClellan, speaking unofficially, hinted that Bush might exercise his constitutional authority and post him to the U.N. by use of a recess appointment. The appointment would stand until January 2007 before it would once again become subject to Senate confirmation. The Bolton nomination was passed on to the full Senate for consideration on March 17. This was done without a favorable recommendation from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) succeeded twice in leading Democrats to block efforts of Republican chamber leaders to bring the matter to a vote. Democrats raised questions on whether Bolton abused subordinates while acting in his role as undersecretary of state, and whether he tried to pressure intelligence analysts to issue reports that conformed to his views. There was also the question of Bolton's past criticisms of the body of the United Nations itself. Democratic filibusters demanded of the Bush administration that it release classified information regarding the involvements of Bolton in his position as the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security since May 11, 2001. In the past, however, Senate confirmation was granted him to fill positions in government posts on four occasions. With a week to go before recess, there are no signs of a Senate breakthrough. In 1998, former President Bill Clinton selected Richard Holbrooke. In what some have called ""partisan bickering"", Republicans blocked Holbrooke for 14 months, before he was finally confirmed in August 1999."
politics,"With the announcement Monday of €2 million in new funding from the European Union (EU), the Republic of Djibouti's Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions. The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones. UNICEF is to contribute a further €60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work. “The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,” said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti. At the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. ""What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields,"" said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman. ""And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens."" Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. “Life is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,” said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli. A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project. “WFP couldn’t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,” said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti. When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. ""The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance,"" said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. ""We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government’s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible,"" he added."
politics,"Afghanistan According to a newly-released report compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), bribes paid to police, military, and public officials over the past year have cost Afghan civilians collectively over US$2.5 billion, nearly the equivalent of a quarter of the country's legitimate GDP. Entitled ""Corruption in Afghanistan"", the report was based on polling of approximately 7,600 people in cities and villages around the nation. According to the report, 59% of those surveyed said that government sanctioned corruption was a more pressing concern to them than insecurity (54%) or unemployment (52%). The report adds that more than half the population had to pay out at least one bribe in 2009. Furthermore, in a country where the economic output is only $425 per person, the average bribe cost nearly $160. Three out of four bribes were paid in cash. Another finding is that one in every three Afghans believed that bribery was just a normal part of society. That being the case, only 9% of those surveyed—for whatever reason—ever chose to report these type acts to the proper authorities. The reports go on to say that there is a widely-held perception among 54% of Afghans that foreign nations and non-governmental organizations are just in their country ""to get rich."" The head of the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, said in a statement to the international media, ""The Afghans say that it is impossible to obtain a public service without paying a bribe. Bribery is a crippling tax on people who are already among the world's poorest."" source=Antonio Maria Costa, Head of the U.N. Office on Drugs &amp; Crime Costa went on to note that there is a ""new caste of rich and powerful individuals who operate outside the traditional power and tribal structures and bid the cost of favors and loyalty to levels not compatible with the under-developed nature of the country. Criminal graft has become similarly monumental, perverse and growing and is having political, economic and even security consequences."" ""It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Afghanistan, to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole. Corruption is the biggest impediment to improving security, development and governance in Afghanistan."" This report was released Tuesday, nine days before a scheduled international conference on Afghanistan in London. There, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is expected to face criticism for his perceived passive stance on corruption from the coalition of nations—especially the United States—that have thousands of troops committed to Afghanistan as part of the Global War on Terrorism. President Karzai was sworn in for a second five-year term last November after a controversial and hard-fought election during which he was widely accused of various types of fraud. Nevertheless, he has staunchly defended his record on corruption, stating that the entire issue had been ""blown out of proportion by Western media."""
politics,"Despite allegations that the Mayor of London's office exerted pressure on the organisers of WorldPride in London to change the start time of the event to reduce the number of people attending, thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people and their supporters marched from Portman Square to Whitehall today. The event celebrated forty years since the first gay pride march in London in 1972.

politics,"Libya The human rights group Human Rights Watch has published a 154-page document accusing the United States of cooperating with Libya under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, in the interrogation and torture of members of the armed group, Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), according to a report in the Huffington Post. The report alleges that the United States and Libya, together with governments from Africa, Asia, and Europe such as the United Kingdom, collaborated in detaining former members of LIFG living outside Libya then deporting them back to Libya where they were allegedly tortured. According to the report, some of those detained where abused even before the were returned to Libya such as those held in United States military bases in Afghanistan. News reports have revealed that the abuse may have occurred between April 2003 and April 2005. Upon the release of the document, Human Rights Watch has stated that their key source of information came from a pile of abandoned documents found on September 3, 2011 from the offices of former Libyan intelligence chief Musa Kusa. They also said that they have interviewed 14 former detainees who allege that they were subjected to abuses ranging from waterboarding, sexual assault, stress positions, beatings, and sleep deprivation."
politics,"LGBT On Thursday the High Court of Australia struck down the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) same-sex marriage legislation. In a landmark decision, the High Court unanimously ruled the term ""marriage"" in Section 51(xxi) of the Constitution of Australia did indeed include marriages between people of the same sex. However, the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961 does not permit or recognise same-sex marriages. Section 109 of the Constitution says when a law is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter prevails. The High Court therefore struck down the ACT legislation in its entirety, ruling it was wholly inconsistent with the Commonwealth law. Some 31 same-sex couples were married under the law in the five days from when it became effective last Saturday, December 7, and when the High Court struck it down on Thursday. Their marriages are now invalid. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said they knew this was a possibility. The ACT Legislative Assembly legalised same-sex marriages in October. The Commonwealth Government challenged the law in the High Court promptly once passed."

politics,"Yesterday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said if the goal is peace and security, then foreign powers should ""get out of the region"" as their presence could cause an arms race. He also announced a new security initiative for the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz to be unveiled at the United Nations General Assembly later this week. Rouhani was speaking at the opening of Sacred Defence Week, an annual commemoration of the eight-year Iran–Iraq War, which features military parades. ""The presence of foreign forces can be dangerous for the region, international waters, as well as the security of shipping lines and energy, but our path is to create unity and coordination with regional countries,"" he said. ""Those who want to link the region’s incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed ... If they are truthful and really seek security in the region, they must not send weapons, fighter jets, bombs and dangerous arms to the region."" ""Your presence has always been a calamity for this region and the farther you go from our region and our nations, the more security would come for our region"", he continued in the speech which was delivered in Tehran, the capital. Rouhani's new security plan would be led by Iran and feature support from regional countries in securing the waterways in the region. According to the Associated Press, Iran has increased cooperation in the last few years with the navies of China, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Russia. The speech came approximately one week after an attack on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia which halved Saudi oil output. The attack was claimed by the Houthi movement in Yemen, but both Saudi Arabia and the United States have alleged Iranian involvement. The initial reports were of drone attacks, but the Saudi government said the attack included cruise missles which could not have originated in Yemen. The United States was more forceful in blaming Iran for the attack, committing to send more troops to Saudi Arabia. Recently, the United States announced a naval coalition to patrol the Persian Gulf which was joined by Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly is set to open tomorrow."
politics,"Economy and business The British Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition government has scrapped plans by the previous government to change the rules on equal pay between men and women. The previous Labour government included a provision in the Equality Act 2010—Section 78—to allow the government the option to introduce regulations that would require companies to publish details of the difference in pay between male and female employees. If the government had activated such regulations, they would have come into force in 2013. The current government have decided not to activate this requirement and instead will only ask businesses to provide this data voluntarily and will set an ""aspiration"" to dramatically increase the number of women in senior positions in business. Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP and coalition Equalities Minister, in announcing the plans stated that the government wishes ""to move away from the arrogant notion that government knows best, to one where government empowers individuals, businesses and communities to make change happen."" Featherstone announced the policy at the School of Management at Cranfield University, who have conducted research finding that only 12.5% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women, up from 12.2% last year—""glacially slow"" progress according to business commentator David Prosser. Featherstone justified not implementing the pay audits due to the economic costs: ""Right at this moment of financial peril to the nation is perhaps not the moment to introduce mandatory pay audits."" This breaks with a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment, as well as contradicting Featherstone's own words two years ago in support of the audit: ""A voluntary audit system for private industry is hardly worth the paper it's printed on. We need to know when the government actually plans to step in if progress isn't made."" Women's groups and trade unions have condemned this move. Dave Prentis, the general secretary of UNISON, Britain's second largest trade union, said that this is an example of the government ""stripping down its commitment to equality"". source=Dave Prentis Prentis continued: ""It is a disgrace that women are still getting paid less than men. This move threatens to turn the clock back on all the progress already made with equal pay."" Ceri Goddard, the chief executive of the feminist campaigning group the Fawcett Society, condemned the plans: ""The persistent gap in pay between men and women is one of the starkest examples of inequality in the UK today. The government's decision not to bring into force section 78 is a huge disappointment and means this injustice will continue for a long time to come. The government has today consigned another generation of women to lower pay. Their proposal to rely only on voluntary business action on pay isn't just naive, it sends a dangerous signal that tackling discrimination against women is a choice, not a requirement."" Yvette Cooper, Featherstone's shadow minister on the Labour benches, called the news ""another broken promise from the government"" and said that ""scrapping Labour's plan to increase transparency in pay is a backwards step for women's equality."""
politics,"Democrats in the United States House of Representatives have sent a letter to new Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asking her to release funds to reconstruct agencies in the Gaza Strip. The letter also said she should try to reason with Israel to allow people in Gaza in need of medical attention and emergency transportation between the Israel and Gaza border. The letter, released to the AFP news agency, says ""we... urge you to express this concern directly to Israeli government officials"". The letter says the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) need an estimated $350 million dollars for rebuilding of Gaza and to provide relief to residents. ""Failure to address this humanitarian emergency has the potential to produce a crisis of even more unspeakable proportions,"" the letter added, ""we therefore respectfully request that the State Department release emergency funds to UNRWA for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance"". They also urged Clinton and her team to make a list of ""actions taken to date and the strategy you will pursue to address the humanitarian crisis"", saying ""with the ceasefire now in effect, it is critical that the United States play a leading role in alleviating the suffering of civilians in Gaza and we respectfully urge your assistance in this task"".

politics,"Portugal's Superior Council of National Defence (CSDN) decided Wednesday the composition of the countries' participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The decision reached by the Superior Council of National Defence yesterday evening will be to send a Engineering Company with 140 troops as part of its participation in UN's peacekeeping force in Lebanon. At the end of the Council's meeting CSDN's spokesman, General Goulão de Melo told the journalists that the Portuguese contingent would participate in the ""reconstruction of the infrastructures destroyed during the war"", adding that the duration of the mission will be established in agreement with the UN's established calendar. Portugal's Defense Minister Nuno Severiano Teixeira said Wednesday night, during a news conference that the Company, based in Santa Margarida, near Abrantes, will be deployed on October 14, integrating this way what the Minister considers UNIFIL' third generation forces. ""They will be on the ground but they are not a fighting force; they will be working on reconstruction so the risk they face is moderate"", Teixeira said. This confirms what already was foreseen by defence specialists, due the fact that Portugal doesn't have any adequate means available for the Lebanese Theater of Operations, and since countries like Germany and the Netherlands already confirmed the possibility of sending warships, a Portuguese offer of a frigate to patrol the Lebanese coast would become redundant. Also at the meeting held by the CSDN the reduction of the Portuguese participation in international peacekeeping missions was approved. The Defense Minister responded by saying that Portugal already has manifested the interest in reducing its participation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also the reduction of the Portuguese Marines currently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is scheduled to begin on November. The Portuguese participation in the UNIFIL is calculated in €9.3 millions. Portugal will spend this year about €88.4 millions with all its international missions in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Democratic Republic of the Congo, East Timor, and Kosovo."

It follows the lead taken by Uruguay which ratified it earlier this year. Only two countries are needed in order for it to take effect. Upon taking effect, the convention is intended to protect the rights of around 53 to 100 million domestic workers around the world. Based on UN estimates, many of them are women and migrant workers. The ILO has noted that these workers work in a sector that lacks regulation and is informal. According to the UN, the convention intends to grant the workers several rights. These include freedom of association and collective bargaining, protection from child labor, forced labor, and discrimination. Also included are chapters that entitles domestic workers to a contract that specifies the type of work, salary, the hours of work, paid leave, and days off."
politics,"Invited to participate in a debate at Columbia University during his visit to New York City this week to address the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad engaged University president Lee Bollinger on a number of topics, including his country's human rights record, opinions on Israel and the Holocaust and the role of nuclear weapons and terrorism on the global stage. The Iranian president's speech was marked by protests, but also drew applause from students. Bollinger opened the debate addressing critics, stating that ""To those who believe that this event should never have happened, that it is inappropriate for the university to conduct such an event, I want to say that I understand your perspective and respect it as reasonable...it is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. This is the right thing to do and indeed, it is required by the existing norms of free speech"" Bollinger then gave his opening address, turning to Ahmadinejad and stating: homosexuals and so many of our academic colleagues become targets of persecution in your country?"" ""Why do you support well-documented terrorist organizations that continue to strike at peace and democracy in the Middle East, destroying lives and the civil society of the region? Frankly, and in all candor Mr. President, I doubt that you will have the intellectual courage to answer these questions, but your avoiding them will in itself be meaningful to us. I do expect you to exhibit the fanatical mind-set that characterizes what you say and do. After reciting the Bismillah and asking for guidance from God, Ahmadinejad countered that ""In Iran, tradition requires that when we invite a person to be a speaker, we actually respect our students and the professors by allowing them to make their own judgment and we don’t think it’s necessary before the speech is even given to come in with a series of claims..."" Ahmadinejad's most pointed arguments, though, were directed at the administration of George W. Bush. ""They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls … They create an insecure psychological atmosphere, in order to justify their war-mongering acts in different parts of the world."" The Iranian president attacked what he considered to be errors of American imperialism. ""By using precise scientific methods and planning, they begin their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations, which are the result of thousands of years of interaction, creativity and artistic activity. They try to eliminate these cultures in order to strip people of their identity."" Ahmadinejad questioned U.S. nuclear policy. ""Making nuclear, chemical and biological bombs and weapons of mass destruction is yet another result of the misuse of science and research by the big powers."" He added, ""Without the cooperation of certain scientists and scholars, we would not have witnessed production of different nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Are these weapons to protect global security? What can a perpetual nuclear umbrella achieve for the sake of humanity? If nuclear war is waged between nuclear powers, what human catastrophe will take place?"" In a rebuttal to claims that his country oppressed women and homosexuals, Ahmadinejad responded by claiming ""It is wrong for some governments, when they disagree with another government, to...spread lies"", pointing to the fact that over 50% of Iranian voters are female, and the two female Vice Presidents. When challenged by Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays he stated that ""In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,"" drawing laughter from the audience. ""In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."" He framed questioning of the Holocaust as stifled academic debate: ""Right now, there are a number of European academics who have been sent to prison because they attempted to write about the Holocaust or research it from a different perspective, questioning certain aspects of it,"" later adding that ""you shouldn't ask me why I'm asking questions, you should ask yourselves why you...want to stop. Do you ever take what is known as absolute in physics? We had principles in mathematics that were granted to be absolute for over 800 years, but new science has...gone forward."" The first question from the audience addressed the controversial issue of the leader's position on Israel. Ahmadinejad did not directly respond to the subject of Israel - stating ""We love all nations. We love the Jewish people. There are many Jews living in Iran, with peace and security."", and concluded that it was not a question of Israel's right to exist, but of Palestinian self-determination. Countering claims that his country supports terrorism, he replied, ""We’re a cultured nation. We don’t need to resort to terrorism. We’ve been victims of terrorism ourselves. It’s regrettable that people who argued they are fighting terrorism — instead of supporting the Iranian nation — are supporting the terrorists and then turn the finger at us."" The final question from the audience asked whether Iran would engage in talks with the United States, to which he replied ""If the U.S. government recognizes the rights of the Iranian people, respects all nations and extends a hand of friendship to all Iranians, they will see that Iranians will be among their best friends."" In closing, Ahmadinejad extended gratitude and thanks to the University, and welcomed both students and faculty to attend Iranian universities and give lectures themselves to the students."
politics,"The Australian presence in East Timor so far has been characterised by vigorous patrolling into the capital Dili, with the main goal being to lock down the city in order to separate and concentrate the various conflicting forces in East Timor. Despite the Australian military being provided strong rules of engagement by the East Timorese government, so far no soldiers have fired their weapons or been fired upon, although they might have been fired over by gangs earlier today. Outside the Hotel Timor today, where East Timorese Prime Minister Alkatiri was about to hold a press conference, an Australian patrol arrested what appeared to be two gangs about to storm the hotel with the help of reinforcements. The men numbered around 30, carrying machetes, knifes, spears, slingshots, and arrows. The Prime Minister claimed that the gangs were attempting a coup d'etat. Civilian gangs, allegedly provided arms by the East Timorese military, have so far been blamed for much of the violence in Dili. As the rest of the 1300 strong Australian deployment is expected to arrive in East Timor tomorrow, Australian Prime Minister John Howard has said that although his government did foresee the current situation in East Timor, military action would have constituted an invasion until mandated through the United Nations' or East Timorese government's request. ""...People say you should have seen it coming. The answer is yes, I did, but until you are asked, it happens to be an invasion."" said Mr Howard. East Timor requested military assistance from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal on May 23, Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta explaining that the government ""...couldn't control the situation,""; all four nations responded positively to the request. 2006 East Timor crisis Despite one newspaper running the headline ""We'll stay till job's done, says PM"", the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston has said that he hopes the Australian military will be able to be replaced within a few months by a UN peacekeepers. In any case, ACM Houston has said that he is believes the Australian presence will stabilise the situation soon, perhaps aided by the good relations that exist between the ADF and the leader of the rebel group, Major Alfredo Reinado. MAJ Reinado was trained by the ADF for three months and has openly welcomed the arrival of the peacekeeping force, saying that the deployment is the ""only solution"" in the face of the government's inability to resolve the conflict. After praising the speed of the deployment, Washington revealed that the US assisted the transport of Australian troops to position in Townsville and Darwin two weeks earlier. Indonesia has now closed its border to East Timor, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono saying that ""besides security reasons, the closure of the border is to prevent the possibility of issues that may worsen the image of Indonesia."""
politics,"Syria After the Syrian government denied the army used chemical weapons against the densely populated eastern Ghouta region of Damascus on Wednesday, armed forces heavily bombed the neighborhood yesterday. Reports say anywhere between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in Wednesday's alleged chemical attack, but there are no reports of injuries or deaths in yesterday's bombings. Many of those killed appeared to be children. Some of the pictures and video coming out of the country don't show blood and dismembered bodies, but instead show, according to witnesses, those who died from apparent suffocation; some were foaming at the mouth and others were having convulsions. One video posted to YouTube purportedly shows a young girl who survived the alleged attack, yelling ""I’m alive, I’m alive."" At one point, according to The Washington Post, the girl even tries to convince the hospital official she is still alive. The bombings come as United Nations observers began to arrive to investigate claims of chemical weapons use elsewhere in the nation. According to Russian officials, the Syrian government is ready to give UN observers ""maximum cooperation"" while they perform their investigation. ""We hope that the results will clarify the issue and will help to dispel numerous speculations around the alleged use of the Syrian chemical weapons while simultaneously creating a positive background for the moves towards the start of the political process of settlement of the Syrian crisis,"" Aleksandr Lukashevich, Russia's foreign minister, said yesterday. Syrian officials say the alleged chemical attack was staged and carried out by rebel forces to ""draw attention to their cause"" ahead of the arrival of UN observers. Deputy Secretary-General of the UN, Jan Eliasson, called the alleged chemical attack 'shocking' and hopes the Syrian government will allow UN observers into the neighborhood as soon as possible. ""We see the need to investigate this as soon as possible; no matter what the conclusions, this represents a serious escalation with grave humanitarian and human consequences,"" said Eliasson who also added there is no confirmation that chemical weapons were used in Wednesday's bombing. A previous attempt by the UN to end the violence in Syria failed. In May of 2012, a UN convoy was hit by an IED (improvised explosive device) while a human rights group reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province. Later that year in August, a 300 person team left the country after their mandate expired, and was never renewed. Commander of the 2012 observation team General Babacar Gaye expressed frustration against both the Syrian armed forces and rebels for not allowing the UN to complete its mission. ""Initially the ceasefire was respected, violence decreased and we were able to do our work throughout the country, but by the middle of June it was clear that the parties were no longer committed to the ceasefire and the result has been an escalation in violence,"" said Gaye in 2012. The UN's 2012 mandate was to; ""monitor a cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor and support the full implementation of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States six-point-plan."" Part of the plan included both sides working and cooperating with the UN special envoy, commitment to ceasing hostilities, and the Syrian army ceasing troop and tank movements against rebels in ""population centers"" throughout the country."
politics,"Wikinews There are suggestions China wants to maintain its financial ties with Syria as its third largest importer in 2010. Would you agree with this? :*Brown: I don't think that is China's key priority. China has a massive economy, and Syria is a very minor player in this. It has some, but not much, energy from Syria. Its real concerns in the current conflict are for stability, and geopolitical. :*Farhi: China's conduct in Syria has been similar to its conduct elsewhere. It has given support to Russia in international forum such as the UNSC United Nations Security Council and has acted opportunistically wherever its economic interest could be pursued. But, Syria is really not an area of interest for China. Its actions and support for the Russian position is derived from its general concerns regarding American imperialism and unilateralism. :*Mitter: China will want, in general, to maintain financial ties with Syria as it does with many countries. China's general position is that internal politics of countries should not interfere with economic ties. WNIQ Do you think China is talking from experience when it says that foreign countries shouldn't get involved with Syria's internal affairs? :*Roggeveen: That stance reflects China’s history as a weak, developing country with a host of territorial disputes with its neighbours. Beijing does not want to set international precedents that will allow third parties to interfere with, for example, the Taiwan issue, Tibet, the East China Sea or the South China Sea. ::But increasingly, China’s stance will conflict with its growing strength and growing responsibilities on the world stage. China is already the world’s second biggest economy and a major strategic power in the Asia Pacific region; and, it will increasingly be expected to take up responsibilities that come with such power. Also, as we saw in the case of Libya &amp;mdash; where China sent a fleet of ships and aircraft to evacuate its nationals &amp;mdash; China has interests and citizens all over the world, both of which need to be protected. :*Brown: It China has always stood by non interference of other counties in the internal affairs of sovereign states; though, this position has changed over time since it was formulated on the back of China's experience of colonisation in the early part of the twentieth-century. Its main priority now is to not see the escalation of issues, as was seen in Iraq and Afghanistan; where it runs the risk of being sucked into lengthy conflicts with no real gameplan, and no clear outcome that is relevant to it. It does not see the Syrian conflict as one where there is a an easy, viable, alternative option waiting to govern the country. And, it is very sceptical about US and others' claims that they can control this problem. :*Farhi: Yes, rejection of interference in the internal affairs of other countries &amp;mdash; particularly of a military kind &amp;mdash; is a principled Chinese position in areas where China doesn't have an over-riding interest. :*Mitter: China has been a hardline advocate of strong territorial sovereignty for decades. This is, in part, a product of its own history of being invaded and occupied by other countries. WNIQ China abstained from a UN Security Council resolution on Libya &amp;mdash; do you think they are trying to reprise what happened in Libya in terms of regime change? :*Roggeveen: China and Russia suspect the 'responsibility to protect' doctrine, which was used by Western powers to justify the Libya intervention, was a smokescreen for regime change. So, they are wary of seeing something similar happen in Syria. China also prefers not to be on its own in the Security Council; so, if the Russians come down against a Libya-like resolution, the chances are that China will join them. :*Brown: They felt there was clear mission-creep with Libya. What, however, has most emboldened them in opposing action in Syria is the position of Russia; which they have been able to stand behind. Diplomatically they dislike isolation, so this has proved the issue they have taken cover from. :*Farhi: Libya has set a bad precedent for many countries who supported, or did not object to, NATO action. So, yes, the Libya example is a precedent; but, in any case, the Syrian dynamics are much more complex than Libya and both Russia and China &amp;mdash; as well as Iran &amp;mdash; genuinely see the attempt to resolve the imbroglio in Syria through military means as truly dangerous. In other words, they see the conduct of Western powers in the past two years as spawning policies that are tactically geared to weaken the Assad regime without a clear sense or strategy regarding what the end game should be. Particularly since at least part of the opposition to Assad has also elicited support from Islamic radicals. :*Mitter: In general China is reluctant to take decisive action in international society, and at the UN. It prefers its partners, such as Russia, to take on confrontational roles while it tries to remain more neutral and passive. WNIQ Do you think a political solution is the only realistic means to resolve the Syrian issue? :* Roggeveen: At the moment, both sides in Syria evidently feel they can still obtain their objectives through force. Perhaps one of them will be proved right; or, perhaps there will be a long-term stalemate with Syria split between regime and opposition forces. :: One important change is the chemical weapons agreement; which now makes it much more difficult for the US or Israel to intervene militarily. The deal also gives the regime some degree of status as a legal authority with which outside powers must negotiate. That weakens the hand of the opposition; but, it could open a door for an international diplomatic intervention to achieve &amp;mdash; firstly &amp;mdash; a cease fire. and perhaps then something more substantive. :* Brown: There is no appetite for the kinds of expensive and very hard interventions undertaken in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, in any case, the US and its allies don't have the money to fund this, and their publics evidently feel no case has been made yet for getting involved. People are weary of the endless arguments in the Middle-East, and feel that they should now be left to deal with their own issues. China, in particular, has tried to maintain as strong a ... network of benign support in the region as possible, while avoiding getting sucked into problems. There is no viable opposition in Syria that would make it easier to justify intervention; and, no easy way of seeing how this tragic civil war is going to be easily ended. :* Farhi: Syria has become the arena for a proxy war among regional and extra-regional players and yes its civil war will not end until all key players and their external supporters develop a political will to end the conflict. For the conflict to end, the bankers feeding the conflict should agree to stop funding it. :* Mitter: Yes. But, it will depend on Russia, China, and the US, being able to come up with a compromise solution. That looks to be a long way off. Wikinews For many years, Syria has been considered Iran's ""closest ally"". What vested interest does the Iranian government have in keeping Bashar al-Assad in power? :*Kamrava: These interests are primarily strategic, with both countries sharing common interests in relation to Lebanon &amp;mdash; particularly the Hezbollah group &amp;mdash; and as deterrence against Israeli intervention. :*Martel: Iran's interests align very closely with that of Russia in supporting Syria and opposing the United States. Further, during this last week, President Putin offered to help Iran build a second nuclear reactor. The policies of Russia, Iran, and Syria align quite closely; thus leading some &amp;mdash; such as myself &amp;mdash; to argue that we are seeing the rise of an ""authoritarian axis"" of states, whose policies are coordinated. :*Posch: First, Syria was Iran's only ally against Saddam Hussein and an indispensable partner in Lebanon since the early 1980s. :: Even before the fall of Saddam in 2003, Iran reinterpreted the basically pragmatic cooperation in the field of intelligence and security. Ever since Syria was part of a so called ""axis of resistance"" consisting of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the sole common strategic denominator of these different actors is hostility against Israel, which is always depicted as an aggressor against whom the Muslims should resist &amp;mdash; hence, the designation as an ""axis of resistance"". Of course, forming an alliance 'officially against Israel' serves another purpose too: to take a stand against Saudi Arabia without naming it. Much of the current crisis in Syria has to do with this scheme. :*Farhi: Syria supported Iran during the Iran–Iraq war; and, that dynamic forged a long-standing relationship between the two countries that includes economic, political, and military cooperation. In more recent years, Iran, Syria and Hezbollah have self-identified as an axis of resistance against Israeli&amp;ndash;American involvement in the region. Despite this, Iran initially mostly followed the Russian lead in the Syria. However as other regional players &amp;mdash; such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as extra-regional players such as the United States &amp;mdash; began to see, and articulate the weakening of, the Assad regime as a first step to the weakening of Iran, this enhanced Iran's threat perception, and gave it an incentive for further involvement in support of Assad. Wikinews Do you think Iranian support for the Syrian government is a way of standing up against UN sanctions imposed on them, and opposing American imperialism? :* Kamrava: No. Iranian&amp;ndash;Syrian relations are rooted in common strategic interests rather than in assumptions about US imperialism, or the role of the UN sanctions. :* Martel: Both Iran and Syria share a strategic interest in undermining the influence of the US and the West. :* Posch: Definitely not. The sanctions track is a different one, checking American ""imperialism"" &amp;mdash; as you call it &amp;mdash; is, of course. one aim. :* Farhi: As has become evident in the past few weeks, the primary interactive dynamic regarding the Syrian imbroglio is being played out mostly in terms of US&amp;ndash;Russian rivalry; and, Iran is following the Russian lead. Wikinews The UN has ""overwhelmingly"" confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria. Do you think both sides have used chemical weapons? :* Kamrava: It is undeniable that chemical weapons were used in Syria. But, I have not yet seen conclusive evidence for the responsibility of the use of chemical gas by one side or another. Until valid evidence is made available &amp;mdash; proving who used chemical weapons &amp;mdash; affixing blame to either the government forces, or to one of the fractious rebel groups, is only a matter of speculation. :* Martel: I remain skeptical that anyone other than the Syrian government used chemical weapons. It is widely accepted that the Syrian government was behind the use of chemical weapons. :* Posch: I think the Report is quite clear on that. :* Farhi: I &amp;mdash;as an academic, with no access to on the ground information &amp;mdash; am in no position to know whether both sides have used chemical weapons. Wikinews Would you agree that part of Iran's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: religion and strategy? :* Kamrava: No, I do not agree. Iran's ""vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad"" is a product only of Iran's strategic calculations. :: While foreign policies anywhere may be expressed &amp;mdash; and justified &amp;mdash; through slogans and ideological rhetoric, they are based on strategic considerations and calculations. Despite common, journalistic misconceptions, religion has not played a role in Iranian foreign policy; whether in relation to Syria or anywhere else. :* Martel: Iran's vested interest in Syria is entirely geo-strategic. Iran's support for Syria is designed to undermine US power and influence. For Iran, no policy objective is more important than to possess nuclear weapons. When the U.S. declared a ""redline"" if Syria ""used or moved"" chemical weapons, and then backed away from that redline, it is likely that Iran's leadership drew one principal conclusion: ::: the US redline on Iran's nuclear program is in doubt, the US commitment to preventing Iran from possessing nuclear weapons is in doubt, :: and that Iran likely will test US resolve. :: In strategic terms, doubts about the credibility of the US redline on Iran dwarfs any concerns about Syria's chemical weapons. :: The belief in Iran &amp;mdash; that the US may not be willing to prevent Iran from possessing nuclear weapons &amp;mdash; could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It is difficult to exaggerate just how dangerous a nuclear-armed Iran is for regional and global security. :*Posch: No, it is strategy, and perhaps ideology. Religion doesn't play too much of a role, even though the conflict has been thoroughly ""sectarianised"". This happened a few years back when the Saudis baptised (if that term is appropriate) the ""axis of resistance"" to ""shiite crescent"". The domination of the Syrian Baath Party by members of one sect plays no role in Iran's security equation. Attempts to convert Syrian Alevites to Mainstream Shiites are initiatives of some individual Ayatollahs. I have already mentioned the strategic aspect, an axis of resistance against Israel and Saudi Arabia simultaneously; to this I would add Iranian concern over the Kurdish issue. :* Farhi: The Assad government is a secular government, and Iran's relationship with it has nothing to do with religion or religious affinities. The relationship is a complex one &amp;mdash; and, as mentioned before &amp;mdash; forged as a strategic bond during the Iran&amp;ndash;Iraq War, when Saddam's regime was deemed aggressively expansionist by both regimes. Wikinews Iran is home to the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation. The Syrian rebels are Sunni. Could this be a Sunni vs. Shiite alignment in the Middle East? :* Kamrava: No. While sectarianism may be the lens through which some of the Syrian rebels see their fight against the government, ultimately the contest is over state power and capitalizing on opportunities created by the Arab uprisings in general; and, the Syrian civil war in particular. Sunni&amp;ndash;Shia 'alignments' have nothing to do with it. :* Posch: Usually, the Sunni&amp;ndash;Shia divide is something Iranians and Saudis play up in order to put pressure on one another; usually, they were also able to deescalate. Syria, however, is the game-changer &amp;mdash; for the simple reason that nobody believes the Saudis would control the post Al-Qaeda Networks in Syria. What Iran fears is an increase of the most-radical Sunni anti-shiism, the so called takfiris, spilling over onto Iranian territory. :* Farhi: The Sunni governments in the region are working hard to use sectarian tensions as an instrument to fan popular resentments, in the region, towards Shi'ite Iran. But, the rivalry is actually political; and, has to do with the fears rivals have of what they consider &amp;mdash; I think wrongly &amp;mdash; to be Iran's hegemonic aspirations in the region. :: Sectarianism is an instrument for shaping regional rivalries, and not the source of problems, in the region. Wikinews Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. Do you think this means Russia's interest lies in economic benefit, as opposed to the humanitarian crisis? :* Blank: Although Russia sells Syria weapons, Russia's main interest has nothing to do with humanitarianism or economics. :: Rather, its main interests are to force the US to accept Russia as an equal &amp;mdash; so that Moscow has an effective veto power over any further American actions of a strategic nature there and elsewhere &amp;mdash; and second, to restore Russia's standing as an indispensable great power in the Middle East without whom nothing strategic can be resolved. :: It should be noted that in neither case is Russia actively interested in finding solutions to existing problems. Rather, it seeks to create a bloc of pro-Russian, anti-American states and maintain simmering conflicts at their present level while weakening US power. :* Martel: Russia's principal interests in Syria are twofold. First, Moscow's support is geopolitical in design. It is designed precisely to undermine and weaken American influence in the Middle East and globally. The extent to which Russia can undermine American influence directly helps to bolster Russia's influence. For now, Russia is such a vastly diminished power &amp;mdash; both politically, economically, militarily, and technologically &amp;mdash; that Russian policymakers are pursuing policies they believe will help to reverse Russia's strategic decline. ::Second, Syria is Russia's strongest ally in the region, if not the world, while Syria is the home to Russia's only foreign naval base. :* Farhi: Syria is Russia's only solid strategic ally in the Middle East. Syria, in effect, is a Russian client. Russia's interests lie in maintaining that foothold, and perhaps extending it. :: It also has a concern regarding the civil war in Syria spawning what it considers to be extremist Islamist activities, which it has had to contend with within its own borders. WNIQ Do you believe Russia distrusts US intentions in the region &amp;mdash; in the sense of countering the West on regime change? :* Blank: It is clear that Russia not only does not trust US interests and judgment in the Middle East, it regards Washington as too-ready to use force to unseat regimes it does not like and believes these could lead to wars; more importantly, to the attempt to overthrow the present Russian government. That is critical to understanding Moscow's staunch support for Assad. :* Martel: Russia's policymakers understand that American and Russia interests directly diverge. Russia seeks to undermine US geopolitical influence, and increase its own. It is using its support of the Syrian regime to accomplish that objective. American interests, by contrast, are largely to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons. :: Appallingly, Russia is supporting Syria despite the fact that all evidence points to Syria's use of chemical weapons. ::One would think that American policymakers would be more critical of Russia; which is directly supporting a regime that used poison gas to slaughter its own men, women, and children. :* Farhi: It is less about trust and more about protection of geopolitical interests and prevention of even more dire consequences if Assad goes. It is true that Russia feels that the United States and NATO went beyond the mandate afforded to them by the UN Security Council in going after regime change in Libya. :: However, Russia's geopolitical, and economic, interests in Syria are much more important; and, the relationship between the two countries is much deeper. WNIQ The Russian Government accepts that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. How does it come to claim that the rebels are behind the attacks even though it is widely accepted that the al-Assad government has stocks of weapons? :* Blank: It Russia simply intends to defend Assad to the hilt; and is hardly unwilling to lie &amp;mdash; especially as its intelligence service is notorious for fabricating mendacious and biased threat assessments, and is not under any form of effective democratic control. :* Martel: Russia's claims that Syrian rebels were behind the chemical weapon attacks is, frankly, inexplicable. Worse, Russia's basic credibility is undermined by such statements. :* Farhi: Russia claims Syria has presented it with evidence that the rebels have used chemical weapons; and Russia, in turn, has given the evidence to the UNSC. It has also called the UN report one-sided and biased. The bottom line is &amp;mdash; the claim that the opposition to the Assad regime is at least as culpable in the violence being committed in Syria, opens the path for Russia to continue calling for a political solution which brings to the table all parties to the conflict in Syria, including Assad and his supporters; something the multi-voiced opposition has so far refused. WNIQ Would you agree that Russia's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: economics and ideology? :* Blank: As I said above, Russia's interest in Assad is bound to two geopolitical factors: maintaining the security of its regime; and, equally important, weakening America in the Middle-East &amp;mdash; if not globally &amp;mdash; and ensuring that Russia's great power status is thereby ensured. :* Martel: Russia's vested interest in protecting Syria's al-Assad is driven by geopolitics. :: To support Assad, is to counter US policy and influence; which is precisely what Putin's government seeks to accomplish. In many senses, Russia's support for Syria is entirely secondary to Russia's strategy of reversing its two-decade long decline in every measure of power. With its weak economy, dependence on petroleum for half of its national income, and increasingly authoritarian government, Russia has relatively little to offer the world &amp;mdash; other than to oppose the United States as part of its strategy of reversing its decline. :: While Russia's geopolitical influence clearly increased as a result of its support for Syria, its long-term economic prospects remain quite dim. :* Farhi: It is economic as well as political. :: Syria is a customer of Russian arms and goods; hosting a naval supply base in Tartus. But, as mentioned above, Russia has serious concerns regarding what comes after Assad. For Russia, the current regime is better than chaos or control by Islamists."
politics,"North Korea nuclear program According to South Korea-based Yonhap News service, and the Associated Press, North Korea has announced that it has successfully conducted its first nuclear test. North Korea first announced it possessed nuclear weapons in 2005, though because it had not conducted a nuclear test its nuclear capability remained ambiguous. The United States, Japan, China, and South Korea have all urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. North Korea released a statement on October 3 saying that it would soon conduct a nuclear test, and also emphasized that it would neither use nuclear weapons first nor aid other countries in nuclear proliferation. The state claimed that it would only use the weapons as a deterrent against the United States and its allies. In 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said that they ""would not tolerate"" a nuclear North Korea. China and Japan have also expressed concern. U.S. officials have reported that the government of the People's Republic of China was given a 20-minute advance warning that the test was about to occur. The PRC sent an emergency alert to Washington through the United States embassy in Beijing and President George W. Bush was told shortly after 10 p.m. that a test was imminent by National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. Rumors of an impending nuclear test have circulated since North Korea announced its weapons capability. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that North Korea may have up to 10 or 12 nuclear devices already built. According to North Korea's Central News Agency, the country conducted an underground nuclear test successfully without any radioactive leakage. Underground tests, if they fully contain the nuclear blast, can result in a minimum of nuclear fallout contamination. If confirmed, the nuclear test by North Korea would be the first nuclear test since the dual Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests of 1998. The U.S. Geological Service has recorded a magnitude 4.2 event in eastern North Korea at 01:35:27 (UTC), or 10:35:27 North Korean local time. U.S. President George W Bush speaking at the White House ahead of an emergency closed session of the UN Security Council called the action ""unacceptable ... North Korea has defied the will of the international community and the international community will respond."" He also described it as ""a threat to international peace and security. The United States condemns this provocative act."" Bush contacted the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, the other nations that have been engaged in negotiations with North Korea. All have already denounced the action. China using the harshest language yet against its old war time ally, calling the test ""brazen"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insisted on ""decisive action."" Some experts are speculating that the test may push the United Nations to back sanctions against the North Koreans, Japan's U.N Ambassador Kenzo Oshima has told reporters in New York that the United States is drafting the resolutions, which could range from trade restrictions to monetary dealings and even a sea based blockade. The sitting members have strongly condemned the nuclear test. In the first significant reaction to the announcement the South Korean government has decided to suspend a scheduled shipment of its emergency relief aid to its northern neighbor. An official from the Unification Ministry said ""A ship was scheduled to depart ... carrying 4,000 tons of concrete on Tuesday, but we decided to delay the shipment under the current circumstances."" The yield of the device has not been conclusively confirmed. Fox News has reported the yield at below 4 kilotons, citing a unspecified senior Bush administration official; however, Russian military sources estimate the yield as between 5-15 kilotons. The Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources stated its estimate of the yield as 550 tons, but later scaled it up to 800 tons. A senior seismologist at the Australian Seismology Research Centre said that a 4.2 magnitude quake would roughly correspond with a one kiloton explosion, but would not say it was conclusive, since it depends on the type of rock that the test was set off in. It has been reported that the Korea Exchange, South Korea's main stock exchange, suspended trading for five minutes upon hearing news of the test."
politics,"The Roman Catholic Church has elected Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires as the new pope. He is to take the papal name Francis and take over from the recently retired Benedict XVI. White smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel chimney at 7:06pm (Rome time) yesterday, signifying that the conclave had elected a new pope after four unsuccessful attempts. Following his election, he appeared at a balcony in St. Peter's Square to greet crowds of onlookers. Introducing himself in St. Peter's Square, Francis was jovial: ""Brothers and sisters, good evening. You know that the work of the conclave is to give a bishop to Rome. It seems as if my brother cardinals went to find him from the end of the earth. Thank you for the welcome."" He went on to say: ""Let's begin this long road from the Bishop of Rome to the people. Let us all behave with love and charity. Let us pray always not just for ourselves, but for others, for everyone in the word"". Born in Buenos Aires on December 17, 1936 and now aged 76, the new pope became a bishop in 1992, and was elevated to cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. As a child, he lost a lung due to an infection. He is the first Jesuit pope and the first from the Americas. He was the President of the Bishops' Conference of Argentina from 2005 to 2011. US President Barack Obama made a statement about the election of the new pope: ""On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I offer our warm wishes to His Holiness Pope Francis as he ascends to the Chair of Saint Peter and begins his papacy."" Obama's statement noted the new pope was a ""champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us"", and ""as the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world"". US House Speaker John Boehner also pointed out the new pope came from the Americas: ""I think that reaching out beyond the traditional continent of our church is another big step in the right direction of our church."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said that the papal election was ""a momentous day for the 1.2 billion Catholics around the world"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the election of a new Pope was of ""great significance to Christians everywhere, not least Anglicans"". He went on to describe the new pope: ""Pope Francis is well known as a compassionate pastor of real stature who has served the poor in Latin America, and whose simplicity and holiness of life is remarkable. He is an evangelist, sharing the love of Christ which he himself knows."" In Argentina, he was outspoken against socially liberal policies including the provision of free contraception and gay marriage. Bergoglio said plans to legalize gay marriage in Argentina were ""a plan to destroy God's plan"" and ""a move by the father of lies to confuse and deceive the children of God"". Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Francis would be known as Pope Francis; ""It will become Francis I after we have a Francis II""."
politics,"At least 45 people have been killed in a new surge of violence that began after Kenya's disputed December 27 presidential election. Some sources have said that there have been over 80 deaths in the last 3 days. The latest deaths come as former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is in Kenya to try to broker a compromise. Police had imposed an overnight curfew in the city of Nakuru, about two hours north of Nairobi, after new violence broke out on Friday. The killings appear to be ethnically motivated, as Kikuyus seek revenge for attacks against their fellow tribesmen in recent weeks. Officials estimate that nearly 800 people have been killed since the vote, which saw President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, defeat opposition candidate Raila Odinga by just 230,000 votes. Odinga supporters from the Luo, Kalenjin and other smaller ethnic groups claim the election was stolen, and international observers say the vote was flawed. Widespread anger at the election results sparked violence in Nairobi's slums and parts of the west, and tens of thousands of Kikuyus fled their homes. The violence had largely died down in recent days, but has erupted again in Nakuru. Police also said Saturday that at least 15 people have been killed in the town of Molo, west of Nakuru. The two towns are in the Rift Valley, an ethnically mixed area that has seen violence in the past over land and resources. 4=Jimmy Mucheru, resident of Nakuru ""The Kalenjins had already pushed and got the Kikuyus earlier so what they are doing is the Kikuyus are trying to revenge and get back their places, get back their houses,"" said Jimmy Mucheru, who is a local safari guide in Nakuru. ""There is not much hope for peace because the two groups are really after each other."" The new wave of violence came as former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan was in Kenya trying to resolve the crisis. In a news conference on Saturday, he urged followers of the two leaders to remain calm. He said he saw several camps for people who have been displaced by the crisis. 4=Former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan ""What we saw was rather tragic,"" he noted. ""We visited several IDP camps, we saw people pushed from their homes, from their farms, grandmothers, children, families uprooted. And I think it is important that all Kenyans respond with sympathy and understanding and not try to seek revenge."" On Thursday, Mr. Annan managed to secure the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga, a move hailed as a breakthrough. But the two sides have shown no willingness to negotiate issues of substance. Mr. Kibaki insists he is the legitimate president of Kenya, while Mr. Odinga is demanding a new vote. Mr. Annan urged people to give more time to Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga to work out a solution. ""No one should take the law into his or her own hands,"" he added. ""Allow the leaders the opportunity to resolve these issues - and as I said - including the long-term issues. And we are here to help them, that was the purpose and objective of that meeting."" Mr. Annan told reporters it is unacceptable that no one has been held accountable for the violence, though he did not apportion blame. Earlier this week, the New York-based Human Rights Watch reported what it said was evidence that the opposition had organized some attacks. Mr. Odinga's team has denied those claims."
politics,"New information surfaced on Saturday, 28 May, that suggest that the US and UK increased air strikes against Iraq in mid 2002. The Ministry of Defence figures, provided in response to a question from Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, show that allied aircraft doubled the rate at which they were dropping bombs on Iraq beginning in May of 2002. This apparent escalation in the number and intensity of air strikes was initiated prior to the passage of UN Resolution 1441 in November 2002 and prior to the US Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq in October 2002. Critics claim that this was an attempt to provoke Saddam Hussein or soften his military infrastructure in preparation for a more comprehensive military campaign, and that it reaffirms their assertions that the Bush administrations was determined to go to war long before the official decision was made. In August 2002, allied commander Tommy Franks admitted that this operation was designed to ""degrade"" Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf war, but according to legal guidance appended to the Downing Street memo (dated 23 July 2002) the allied aircraft were only ""entitled to use force in self-defence where such a use of force is a necessary and proportionate response to actual or imminent attack from Iraqi ground systems"". According to military documents shown to the Sunday Express in 2002, the Allies invaded Iraq from Turkey on August 8th, 2002, after an air strike on the 6th that took out a crucial air defence system. Pentagon officials initially denied there had been any military action or incursion, but when challenged with specific military details a spokesman called back two hours later issuing the terse statement: ""We can't comment on current or future operations."" The evidence seems to corroborate information in the Downing Street memo: :""CDS said that military planners would brief CENTCOM on 1-2 August, Rumsfeld on 3 August and Bush on 4 August. :The two broad US options were: :(a) Generated Start. A slow build-up of 250,000 US troops, a short (72 hour) air campaign, then a move up to Baghdad from the south. Lead time of 90 days (30 days preparation plus 60 days deployment to Kuwait). :(b) Running Start. Use forces already in theatre (3 x 6,000), continuous air campaign, initiated by an Iraqi casus belli. Total lead time of 60 days with the air campaign beginning even earlier. A hazardous option. :The US saw the UK (and Kuwait) as essential, with basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus critical for either option. Turkey and other Gulf states were also important, but less vital. The three main options for UK involvement were: :(i) Basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus, plus three SF squadrons. :(ii) As above, with maritime and air assets in addition. :(iii) As above, plus a land contribution of up to 40,000, perhaps with a discrete role in Northern Iraq entering from Turkey, tying down two Iraqi divisions. :The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun ""spikes of activity"" to put pressure on the regime. No decisions had been taken, but he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections."" In light of these revelations, Representative John Conyers has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield. A draft of the letter is available here. In Conyer's draft, he states: :""The allegations and factual assertions made in the May 29 London Times are in many respects just as serious as those made in the earlier article. If true, these assertions indicate that not only had our nation secretly and perhaps illegally agreed to go to war by the summer of 2002, but that we had gone on to take specific and tangible military actions before asking Congress or the United Nations for authority."" :Thus, while there is considerable doubt as to whether the U.S. had authority to invade Iraq, given, among other things, the failure of the U.N. to issue a follow-up resolution to the November 8, 2002 Resolution 1441, it would seem that the act of engaging in military action via stepped up bombing raids that were not in response to an actual or imminent threat before our government asked for military authority would be even more problematic from a legal as well as a moral perspective. :As a result of these new disclosures, I would ask that you respond as promptly as possible to the following questions: :1) Did the RAF and the United States military increase the rate that they were dropping bombs in Iraq in 2002? If so, what was the extent and timing of the increase? :2) What was the justification for any such increase in the rate of bombing in Iraq at this time? Was this justification reviewed by legal authorities in the U.S.? :3) To the best of your knowledge, was there any agreement with any representative of the British government to engage in military action in Iraq before authority was sought from the Congress or the U.N.? If so, what was the nature of the agreement? :In connection with all of the above questions, please provide me with any memorandum, notes, minutes, documents, phone and other records, e-mails, computer files (including back-up records) or other material of any kind or nature concerning or relating thereto in the possession or accessible by the Department of Defense."""
politics,"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, denied responsibility for military brothels set up during World War II. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Abe said, ""There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it. So, in respect to this declaration, you have to keep in mind that things have changed greatly."" His statement contrasts with earlier comments in which he seemed to support a 1993 government declaration that Japan had in fact set up wartime military brothels. Korean believe around 200,000 women from a multitude of different nations were forced into brothels during the war, where they would be raped dozens of times daily. However, conservative elements in the Japanese government have often denied or minimized the extent of war crimes taking place during World War II. In 1992, historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi discovered a document titled Regarding the Recruitment of Women for Military Brothels in the Defense Agency's library (The content of this order is ""A Japanese army prohibits the use for the malignant Korean people broker. ""), prompting the government's 1993 declaration. Over the years, several former sex slaves have stepped forward, providing testimony in direct contrast with the Japanese government's."
politics,"Canadian news The Prime Ministers Office announced today there will be a free vote on reopening the gay marriage debate in the House of Commons. Stephen Harper had already talked about having a free vote many times but the date was never set. The previous government lead by former Liberal leader Paul Martin approved same-sex marriage last year. Harper made this vote one of his promises during the federal election campaign. The 2005 legislation made Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize gay marriage after the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. A gay marriage lobby group argued that it was not fair to ""leave this issue hanging over our heads"" and urged the Conservative government to have a vote soon. ""Either get on with the vote or admit that the equal-marriage ship has sailed,"" Laurie Arron, national co-ordinator of Canadians for Equal Marriage said at a news conference. It will not directly challenge the existing legislation but it will ask MPs if they would like to reopen the debate. Because of the composition of the house of commons, the Conservative government's minority status and its lack of allies in the house on this question, the motion is almost sure to be voted down. Many see this motion as a symbolic gesture to satisfy the government's conservative base. Over 12,000 gay couples have married in Canada since Bill C-38 passed. The vote will have to happen before December 15, when the MPs go home for the Christmas holidays."
politics,"Canada The Dalai Lama XIV visited Toronto for the last two day's of his visit to Canada yesterday. He arrived at the Fairmont Royal York hotel in downtown Toronto. He blessed the Tibetan Canadian Community Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario this morning, he also talked about ""The Art of Happiness"" to a crowd of 30,000 people at the Rogers Centre this afternoon, as well as making visits to other places. Tibetan Canadians waited outside of the hotel to meet the Dalai Lama for more than an hour. ""I am just one man. If humanity tomorrow faces great difficulties, one individual cannot escape,"" he said. ""The situation inside Tibet is not as rosy as the Chinese propaganda would say,"" said the Dalai Lama in response to China's ""dissatisfaction"". ""My Chinese brothers and sisters are always very sensitive. And the Tibet issue is very sensitive."" The Dalai Lama fled from Tibet to India after the Tibetan resistance movement collapsed in 1959. China expressed dissatisfaction at the meeting, but did not specify what they are dissatisfied with. However, the Dalai Lama's recent visits to countries around the world is one factor and China says he is pushing to separate Tibet, but he said he wants autonomy, not separatism. There is an unofficial report that the Dalai Lama will be meeting with Pope Benedict XVI on December 13, but the Vatican has not yet commented on whether this is true. ""We express strong dissatisfaction with Monday's meeting,"" said ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao. ""We hope they can reflect on and correct the erroneous actions."" ""It is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and will gravely undermine the relationship between China and Canada,"" said political counsellor, Sun Lushan. The Dalai Lama told Prime Minister Stephen Harper during their meeting on Monday to ""please take a few thousand more"" Tibetan refugees living in exile in Nepal and India, but a spokesman for Immigration Minister Diane Finley said ""According to the UNHCR, they're not facing persecution in India. But having said that, we are prepared to review applications on a case-by-case basis if they're referred to us by the UNHCR."" Secretary of state for multiculturalism Jason Kenney, who is a defender of human rights, particularly freedom of religion, said he hopes the ""entire world gets the message that attacking a 72-year-old Buddhist monk who advocates nothing more than cultural autonomy for his people is counterproductive."" He also said exports to China and Chinese tourism rose after the Dalai Lama was given honorary citizenship in July 2006."

One Israeli soldier was killed and two injured. Three Hezbollah members were killed according to Lebanese security officials. Spokesman Mark Regev defended the action, saying ""Israel reserves the right to act in order to enforce the spirit of the UN resolution,"". The resolution called for a cessation of all hostilities, and an arms embargo. The Israeli Prime minister, Ehud Olmert justified the attack, stating that it was intended to prevent the supply of new weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah. ""The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about a violation by the Israeli side of the cessation of hostilities as laid out in Security Council resolution 1701,"" said a UN spokesperson. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general said violations of the resolution like Israel's ""endanger the fragile calm that was reached after much negotiation and undermine the authority of the Government of Lebanon."" He called on all parties ""to respect strictly the arms embargo, exercise maximum restraint, avoid provocative actions and display responsibility in implementing resolution 1701."""
politics,"Crime and law Former Bosnian president Dr. Ejup Ganić was arrested by the Metropolitan Police at Heathrow Airport, London on Monday. He was attempting to leave the United Kingdom when authorities apprehended him. Ganić was arrested on an extradition warrant issued by the Serbian government for alleged warcrimes he committed during the 1990s Balkans conflict. He is accused of involvement in a 1992 attack on a Yugoslav army convoy in Sarajevo where more than 40 people were killed. Scotland Yard said Ganić ""was arrested on behalf of the Serbian authorities under a provisional extradition warrant alleging 'conspiracy to murder with other named people and breach of the Geneva Convention, namely killing wounded soldiers...',"". A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed Ganić's arrest following ""a extradition request"" from Serbian government. Ganić, now 63 years old, appeared later at the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he was remanded in custody for four weeks. Another court hearing will take place on March 29 when the Serbian authorities are expected to file papers to support the extradition request. Serbian Justice Minister Snezana Malovic told the Beta news agency that her ministry would send the extradition request on Tuesday. Ganić had been in the UK for several days, attending events at Buckingham University, which is partnered with Sarajevo School of Science and Technology where Ganić is a academic. He was also detained on Friday after arriving in London, but was released immediately as no extradition request had been received. Students at the Sarajevo university have phoned radio stations, urging Sarajevans to protest at the British embassy. The Serbian Government had accused Ganić and eighteen others and issued warrants against them in 2009 over the May 1992 attack. He had dismissed these allegations as being ""ridiculous"" and said ""For Serbia, anyone who defended our country must be arrested."" Damir Arnaut, political adviser to Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) president Haris Silajdžić said, ""Bosnia has tried to establish correct relations with Serbia, but this political act is obviously directed against Bosnia's sovereignty."" Ganić's daughter Emina accused Serbia of implicating her father ""on the grounds of the evidence that already was dismissed by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague."" The Association of Detainees of Republika Srpska stated ""by arresting Ganić the international community has finally understood that the time has come that war crimes committed against Bosnian Serbs be processed also."" Ganić has a PhD in Engineering Science from the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston and had lectured in two American universities. He served as both vice-president and president of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina after it broke from the former Yugoslavia. The ethnic cleansing that ensued claimed more than 100,000 victims."
politics,"UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan delivered his farewell address today at the Truman Presidential Museum &amp; Library, Independence, Missouri. He reminded his audience of the far sighted leadership provided by President Harry S Truman in championing the United Nations in its early years. Annan went on to offer five lessons, every one of which led him to conclude that ""such leadership is no less sorely needed now than it was sixty years ago"". The lessons he had learned while in office were that the security of everyone is linked to that of everyone else and that we are all responsible for each other’s welfare; that security and development ultimately depend on respect for human rights and the rule of law; that governments must be accountable for their actions in the international arena, as well as in the domestic one; and that, only by working together through the United Nations, can security, welfare and development be achieved. In the course of his speech, Kofi Annan referred to America as being in the vanguard of the global human rights movement but he warned ""that lead can only be maintained if America remains true to its principles, including in the struggle against terrorism"". He concluded his address saying ""More than ever today Americans, like the rest of humanity, need a functioning global system through which the world’s peoples can face global challenges together. And in order to function, the system still cries out for far-sighted American leadership, in the Truman tradition. I hope and pray that the American leaders of today, and tomorrow, will provide it."" Afterwards, he was asked why he had chosen in his farewell speech to make such a pointed attack on America. He replied, sharply, that ""An appeal for cooperation and leadership should never be seen as an attack""."
politics,"A video provided by the American Enterprise Institute intends to show tortures committed by the soldiers of Saddam Hussein during his rule. The film shows extremely graphic scenes and it is NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN. It depicts Iraqi soldiers singing and praising Saddam, beating prisoners and cutting prisoners' fingers and hands off. During Saddam Hussein's regime, about a quarter of a million Iraqis were executed. Many individual Iraqis of all faiths and ethnicities were tortured and killed for real or perceived opposition to Iraq's government. Torture during Saddam's regime was characterized by: medical experiments, crucifixions, genital amputations, hot iron marking, tongue fixing with a nail, teeth extraction with pincers, public beheadings, etc. The four minute video (27.4 MiB) can be downloaded from the AEI website. This video was released in June 2004. Most of the American and international media didn't show it until now, despite the fact that channels of mass communication regularly released Abu Ghraib's torture photos."
politics,"ScientologyNews media in the United Kingdom are reporting that a boy under the age of 18 was served with a court summons by City of London Police because he held a placard calling Scientology a ""cult"" at a peaceful protest on May 10. Human rights activists have criticized the decision to issue the 15-year-old the summons as an affront to freedom of speech, and representatives for the City of London Police force explained the actions of the police. Individuals from the group Anonymous were protesting Scientology in the fourth protest in as many months, as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring Tom Cruise removed from websites YouTube and Gawker.com. Members of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. At the May 10 protest, the 15-year-old boy was present and held up a placard which stated: ""Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult,"" with a mention at the bottom of the sign to the anti-Scientology website Xenu.net. He attended the protest held outside the Church of Scientology building on Queen Victoria Street, near St Paul's Cathedral in London. In a post made by the boy on the anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org, he stated: ""Within five minutes of arriving I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use that word, and that the final decision would be made by the inspector."" The website describes itself as ""A Source for Information on Dianetics and the Scientology Organization"". Using the pseudonym ""EpicNoseGuy"" at the Enturbulation.org message board, the boy goes on to describe how he was ""strongly advised"" by police to remove the placard. City of London Police cited section five of the Public Order Act 1986 to the boy, which deals with ""harassment, alarm or distress"". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice of Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales, in which Latey called Scientology a ""cult"" and said it was ""corrupt, sinister and dangerous"". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: ""Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. ... In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. ... It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others."" According to the boy's post at Enturbulation.org, the City of London Police told him he had 15 minutes to remove the sign in question. He was given a court summons by the police about a half-hour later, and his sign was removed and taken by the police as evidence. 4=15-year-old boy In videos of the May 10 protest posted to YouTube, City of London Police can be seen telling protesters not to use the word ""cult"" in their signs. Protesters discussed the issue with police and stated that they had checked with lawyers and verified that criticizing religion was a valid form of protest. The police warned protesters that if they violated police instructions regarding usage of signs ""you will be prosecuted"". A female police officer read a form statement to the 15-year-old and stated: ""I've been asked, if you could remove it the sign by 11:30, if not then I'll have to come back and either summons you or arrest you."" The boy read Mr. Justice Latey's 1984 judgment to the police, and then said: ""I'm not going to take this sign down."" He told fellow protesters: ""If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here holding up his sign, I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or given a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen."" After the boy was given a summons one of the protesters asked a member of the City of London Police force: ""Are we allowed to say Justice Latey says Scientology is a cult?"", to which the police officer responded: ""I've already had this discussion with people. Direct quotes by individuals, I haven't got a problem with."" 4=Shami Chakrabarti, director, Liberty ""This barmy prosecution makes a mockery of Britain's free speech traditions. After criminalising the use of the word 'cult', perhaps the next step is to ban the words 'war' and 'tax' from peaceful demonstrations?"" said Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti in a statement in The Guardian. The boy has appealed for help in order to fight the potential charges and possible legal action from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Ian Haworth of the United Kingdom-based Cult Information Centre also commented on the actions of the City of London Police to The Guardian, saying: ""This is an extraordinary situation. If it wasn't so serious it would be farcical. The police's job is to protect and serve. Who is being served and who is being protected in this situation? I find it very worrying."" News of the summons issued to the UK minor has received significant attention on the Internet, hitting the front pages of websites Slashdot, Digg, and Boing Boing on Wednesday. The story has also been discussed in hundreds of blog postings, including sites related to the tech-sector and others related to civil liberties. 4=City of London Police In a statement given to publications including The Guardian and The Register, a representative for the City of London Police explained the rationale for the summons: ""City of London police had received complaints about demonstrators using the words 'cult' and 'Scientology kills' during protests against the Church of Scientology on Saturday 10 May. Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service some demonstrators were warned verbally and in writing that their signs breached section five of the Public Order Act 1986. One demonstrator, a juvenile, continued to display a placard despite police warnings and was reported for an offence under section five. A file on the case will be sent to the CPS."" ""City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully, but we have to balance that with the rights of all sections of the community not to be alarmed, distressed or harassed as a result of others' actions,"" said City of London Chief Superintendent Rob Bastable in a statement given to The Register and The Daily Telegraph. Unlike the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service (the territorial police force responsible for Greater London excluding the City of London) has not raised an issue with protesters using the word ""cult"", according to Londonist. 4=Crown Prosecution Service A spokesman for the CPS told The Guardian that they did not give City of London Police specific instruction about the boy's protest sign. The spokesman said that the CPS gave the City of London Police ""general advice"" about the laws governing protests and ""religiously aggravated crime"", but did not give advice about this specific case. ""... if we receive a file we will review it in the normal way according to the code for crown prosecutors,"" said the CPS spokesman. The City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to The Guardian over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. Janet Kenyon-Laveau, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in the UK, told The Guardian that the relationship between the City of London Police and Scientology was mutually beneficial, and said that Scientologists conducted clean-up campaigns in urban areas affected by drug use problems. A City of London Police spokesman released a statement in November 2006 saying: ""We are conducting a review to ensure that all members of staff are aware of the force policy on accepting hospitality and to assess whether clarification or amendment of this policy is necessary."" Each of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of Lisa McPherson, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of ""Fair Game"" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite ""Sea Organization"" or ""Sea Org"".

politics,"Iran, has decided to pull its finances out of European banks and into different foreign banks. A senior Iranian official stated that this is an attempt to pre-empt possible U.N. sanctions over its resumption of nuclear fuel enrichment activities. Comments by Iran's central bank governor Ebrahim Sheibani, carried on air by the ISNA student news agency, confirmed that Iran had started transferring funds. ""We transfer foreign reserves to wherever we see as expedient. On this issue, we have started transferring. We are doing that,"" Sheibani told the ISNA agency. Ebrahim Sheibani also told the agency that the assets were being moved to an ""undisclosed"" location. It is unknown exactly how much money is involved or whether or not Iran's investments in Europe would be affected by the move. Traders have said that they had already factored such a possibility into the market. Gary Samore, an expert on Iran and vice president for international programs at the McArthur Foundation in Chicago, said ""the move reflected concern by Tehran that the Europeans might take unilateral measures amid the crisis over its nuclear program."" He also added that its decision to pull its assets from Europe ""makes sense in terms of preparing for the possibility that Europe might take some measure to impose some financial sanctions. I don't know that it changes the diplomatic formula. The key issue is still the question of whether or not the Western group can engineer a formal referral to the Security Council."" It is unclear if an asset freeze or other punishment is imminent in Iran, but it has happened before. The country's assets in the United States have been frozen since Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostage after the 1979 Islamic revolution. An Italian court last year had ordered an Iranian bank account to be frozen at the request of U.S. plaintiffs who were seeking compensation for terrorist acts they believe were supported by the country (Iran). Earlier the EU drafted a resolution that calls for referring Iran to the 15-nation council. But it is said to stop short of asking for punitive measures against Iran. The IAEA is expected to meet on February 2, 2006 to discuss Europe's draft."
politics,"Crime and law An international court in Strasbourg issued a ruling yesterday that powers allowing UK police to stop and search anyone without reason are in breach of European law. The European Court of Human Rights deemed powers contained in the Terrorism Act 2000 denied the human right of privacy. Under the European Convention of Human Rights people in the UK are granted the right to privacy, although their government felt that the threat of terrorism meant that the breach of this was justifiable and allowable under exemptions in the Convention. Previously, the powers have been unsuccessfully challenged before the English and Welsh High Court, upheld by those nations' Court of Appeals and finally upheld again before the UK's House of Lords. Section 44 of the Terrorism Act allows the Home Secretary to designate an area for use of the powers for a certain period. If this period was more than a month then at the end of the month then the Home Secretary can renew them. The entirety of Greater London has spent several years with the powers in effect. Under the Act, the police do not need to have any reason to search whoever they like and have the power to confiscate articles they believe to be of use to terrorists. They can also make arrests if these are found. Yesterday's ruling was made in a case brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, both stopped outside a military exhibition in London's Docklands area. Gillan was stopped while cycling past and kept there for twenty minutes while journalist Quinton was ordered to stop filming even after showing her press card. She claims to have been detained for roughly thirty minutes at the scene, while police claim she was there for five minutes. The court awarded €33,850 (£30,400) to cover the costs incurred by bringing the case. UK Home Secretary Alan Johnson expressed disappointment at the ruling and stated that an appeal will be launched. Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said that while this appeal was pending Section 44 of the Act would continue to be used by police. The court found that the humiliation and embarrassment of searching people in public was a clear breach of privacy as well as criticising that the way power was authorised did not require a test that its use be ""necessary,"" merely ""expedient."" The court singled out London's designation under the Act as an area where the powers could be used continuously since it became law as an example of why this was not appropriate. Further criticism in the ruling was aimed at the idea that the decision to search could be ""based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition' of the police officer"". The judgement added that ""the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,"" with no judicial oversight. Racism was a further concern, with the court expressing a fear that the powers could easily be used in a discrimminatory manner. Four times as many blacks and Asians have been searched compared to whites."
politics,"Syria More than 270 civilians were killed in 24 hours from militant shelling in Syrian cities according to a report on Saturday from the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Opposing Sides in Syria. The report, published on the Russian Defense Ministry website, also stated that hundreds of civilians have been injured. In a message directed to the UN's Secretary General and Security Council head, the Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry reported the attacks came from ""moderate"" opposition groups that were joining the Al-Nusra Front and its affiliates in Aleppo, Syria. According to the Center on Saturday, one of the opposition groups, Ahram al-Sham, joined the Al-Nusra Front for an attack against Kurdish militias, which effectively forced Kurds to retreat from their positions in the city on Saturday. The militants' reported new offensive took place in a cessation of Russian and Syrian warplane activity beginning over a week earlier, which enabled the militants to regroup. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the cessation was meant to permit groups coordinating with the United States and Russia to separate themselves from the the Al-Nusra Front. However, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said on television that the United States had requested Russia avoid targeting the Al-Nusra Front, which has affiliations with al-Qaeda. In response, a US State Department spokesperson stated on Friday that the request was to avoid targeting civilians or legitimate opposition. HYS"
politics,"After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that Kofi Annan, head of the United Nations, failed to halt corruption in the Oil for Food program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished Iraqi citizens. According to Paul Volcker, head of the Independent Inquiry Committee, ""Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both."" The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program. While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism."" On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

The group have been released into the Sydney community. Three of the Sierra Leoneans say they face forced female circumcision if they go back. Department of Immigration spokesperson Sandi Logan said the bridging visas were only a stop-gap measure. ""The bridging visa simply enables them to be here lawfully if in the period of time between now and then the type of visa they apply for requires further investigation on a country basis or a country profile, if in fact that's the type of visa and the type of investigation that's required,"" he said. A group of six Sierra Leoneans contacted the Northern Beaches Refugee Sanctuary - who had previously given shelter and assistance to six other missing athletes. Members of the first group of athletes told media that they feared for their safety if they were forced to return to Sierra Leone. Originally 14 of the nation's 22-strong Games delegation were reported missing. Two other Sierra Leone athletes remain at large after visas allowing them to compete in the Games were cancelled by the Department of Immigration. In total, eleven athletes are still missing after the Games finished on Sunday, including seven from Cameroon, a Bangladeshi runner, and a Tanzanian boxer.

politics,"Climate change Campaigners opposed to the expansion of London Heathrow Airport have today scaled the roof of the U.K. Houses of Parliament and hung protest banners reading 'BAA HQ' and 'No 3rd Runway' from the building, before and during Prime Minister's Questions inside the building. The three men and two women were from climate action group, Plane Stupid. The non-violent direct action comes on the day a government consultation into the Heathrow expansion of a third runway ends. The protesters made paper aeroplanes out of confidential Whitehall documents that allegedly show collusion between the British Airports Authority (B.A.A.) and the Government department of transport to subvert the public consultation process on the proposed third runway. These documents were obtained from the Department for Transport by Greenpeace under the freedom of information act. B.A.A. claims a third runway is essential for Britain's economy, and would reduce congestion at Heathrow, actually cutting emissions, and is necessary to keep up with the booming aviation industry. This would allow the number of flights to increase from 480,000 a year to around 702,000 . In a statement given by one of the protesters from the roof to the Guardian newspaper: We've come to this symbolic home of democracy to make clear that the consultation process of the third runway at Heathrow has, from the beginning, been a sham. We're taking direct action as a last resort because we don't believe that the consultation has been a democratic process. This is the beginning of a campaign of direct action that will not cease until we feel we're being listened to and until we're satisfied that it's Londoners' views, rather than B.A.A.'s, that the government paying attention to. Matthew Knowles from the Society of British Aerospace Companies made a statement to the B.B.C. that: ""These stunts are becoming tiresome and do nothing more than peddle inaccurate propaganda."" The rooftop occupation comes two days after Greenpeace protesters scaled an Airbus A320 which had just touched down at Heathrow from Manchester, and follows a succession of direct action protests in the U.K. in relation to climate change."

Daisuke Matsuzaka recorded the win with a 1.38 ERA and was named the tournament's most valuable player. The game was played in PETCO Park before a crowd of 42,696. The highly-touted Japanese team took a commanding lead in the first inning. Vicyohandry Odelin walked one man with the bases loaded, and hit another. The four-run first inning was capped off by Toshiake Imae's two-run single. Cuba used three pitchers in the inning, including starter Omari Romero and reliever Norberto Gonzalez. Japan also added two more runs in the fifth inning, after three straight base hits to start the inning and Michihiro Ogasawara's sacrifice fly with one out. Ichiro Suzuki's one-out RBI single off of Adiel Palma in the ninth drove in Osmani Urrutia, which proved to be the winning run. After an intentional walk, Kosuke Fukudome put the game away with a base hit to left that scored two. Michihiro Ogaswara added a sacrifice fly. Cuba's Eduardo Paret started the bottom of the first inning with a solo home run that landed in the first row of the left field stands. Cuba mounted a rally in the ninth, when Ariel Pastano led off with a double. He was eventually driven in by Cuban shortstop Eduardo Peret's infield single, but Cuba was unable to score any more runs. Cuba responded with four straight hits of their own in the bottom of the sixth, scoring two runs. Designated hitter Yoandy Garlobo grounded into an inning-ending double play, with men on first and third. Frederich Cepeda's two-run home run in the bottom of the eighth inning off of Soichi Fujita cut the Japanese lead to 6-5, before the four-run Japanese ninth put the game away. After 5 failed tries at the Olympics, Japan has finally capped it off with this gold-medal win at the Classic. ""My players showed me a fantastic performance tonight,"" Sadaharu Oh, the team's coach, said through a translator after the game. ""I know they did it for Japan."" Most people agree that this victory has driven home the fact that baseball is now an international sport, not just an American sport. The team has stuck with the tournament, through bad calls and good alike, and the reward was the sterling silver trophy presented to them as champions of the World Baseball Classic. Even Ichiro Suzuki was amazed by their work, saying ""To be honest, I never imagined we'd get there. We had a great team, the best. I hope we showed everyone what a great sport baseball is."" Cuba's amazing run was stopped short, but beisbol was still at the top of Cuba's mind after the defeat. “Personally, I think we have shown the quality of Cuban players,” Cuba manager Higinio Velez said. “I told everybody to have patience. I said we are team of men, not names.” The Cuban team barreled through so many major leaguers, but today everything cracked, especially the pitching. However, they never gave up, rallying in the last inning, but just like Frederich Cepeda said, “We went and fought for this game just like every other game in this tournament, but Japan also went out and fought for this game. We tried to get back on top, but they played better than we did and they deserve the victory because they played better.” Due to the deal that allowed Cuba into the WBC, they are donating all their money to Hurricane Katrina Victims. MLB commissioner and WBC organizer Bud Selig admitted, ""The intensity in the stands as well as the intensity on the playing field was absolutely remarkable, and I'm not sure that going into it you could have felt that. I'm very confident that this will be the platform that we use to take this sport internationally to the dimension that I want to take it and believe that we will."" Spikes worn by Oh, a jersey worn by Matsuzaka, a baseball cap worn by Nobuhiko Matsunaka, a helmet worn by Ichiro, and a warm-up jacket worn by Koji Uehara, will all be sent to Cooperstown's Baseball Hall of Fame to be displayed."

He said the Ukrainian Paralympic team is very democratic, and reached this decision together. Their view is if they boycotted the Games, their message of peace would be forgotten in a few hours. While stating the team intends to compete, the Ukrainian team reserved the right to leave the Games immediately should peace not happen, and the Russian military does further intervention in the Ukraine. Sushkevich, who is also a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, denied accusations their comments and decisions have been political in regards to the two hour delay for the team's welcome to the Paralympic village, and actions taken during the welcome ceremony. Rather, he claimed these actions were motivated by a message of peace and human rights. He claimed the situation for Ukraine is unique. According to Sushkevich, never before during the Paralympic Games has the host country invaded a participating country. Suskevich talked about a discussion he had yesterday with Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, where Sushkevich talked to Putin as a member of the Paralympic family. He said he asked Putin for peace, for detente at least until the Paralympic Games are over. The response he received from Putin was that he was heard and Putin would think about what he said. The President said that he views the achievements of the Paralympics above that of the Olympics, that the Paralympics play a vital role in the lives of the athletes. He said the 31 members of the Ukrainian team want to compete. There is a problem being the national team of the Ukraine, though, when the country is not whole. He later said the team has representatives from ten regions of the country, including the western Russian parts. Further comments were made by Ukrainian Paralympic Committee President that in past few years, all of Ukraine's Paralympians who were veterans of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He hoped in the future, there would be peace and there would be no need to have veterans on the team who had disabilities that were a result of war. Ukrainian biathlon competitor Grygorii Vovchynskyii also spoke during the press conference. He said Ukrainian Paralympians are part of a big family, and supporters ask them every day how they feel. According to Vovchynskyii, Ukrainian Paralympians want peace. They are ready to compete. They want to show they are a free and independent people who love fair competition. At a press conference immediately following the Ukrainian one, IPC representative Craig Spence said IPC learned of Ukraine's decision to compete at the same time as the media. He said he would prefer Ukraine competes but would understand if they decided to leave. Spence also said all 45 teams and all competing athletes were reminded there could be no alterations to their kits, and no protests. Everyone is bound by these rules, and the IPC is monitoring social media for athlete compliance."

They hope to cover the route, which is roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) long, in just ten days. They started on June 7, 2013 and plan to finish by June 16. Along the way, they intend to do outreach, and mentor people with disabilities. They hope to raise A$13,000. So far, they have raised over A$12,400. They are using crowdfunding to finance their sporting event. Del Toso suffered muscle deterioration in her legs and hands due to a degenerative neurological condition when she was 19, and rides her bike with the aid of orthotics. Chaplin was born a paraplegic, and is using a handcycle. They won silver medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London with the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, commonly known as the Gliders.

Robič died after colliding with a 55-year-old driver whilst riding down hill in Jesenice. He was on a training ride in preparation for the Australia's Crocodile Trophy mountain bike race. An investigation into the accident is underway. Robič was a five-time winner of the Race Across America men's solo, with his first victory in 2004. He dropped out of the 2009 race whilst in second place due to a time penalty he felt he unfairly received. His last victory in the race was earlier this year. Robič's five wins is a record in men's solo races. Before competing in ultra-marathons, Robič was a member of the Slovenian national cycling team from 1988 to 1994.

sport,"Canada Four months and 3,200 kilometres ago, Canadian runner Jonathan Howard began his run across the second-largest country in the world, to raise awareness for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A graduate of McMaster University, Howard arrived in Toronto this week, to address the nation's largest city before continuing his westward run which will take him through all ten Canadian provinces. Howard was met Monday at a charity barbecue by Senator Art Eggleton. The fundraiser was part of Howard's strategy to raise 2.5 million dollars to assist families that support children with ASD. ""Spectrum is a very puzzling word,"" he told the gathering ""because there are many types of autism on that spectrum"". The real goal of his RunTheDream.ca charity drive though, Howard explained, was simply to ""get people involved in the issue"" and generate attention for the little-understood disorder. Eggleton, who welcomed Terry Fox to the city as mayor in 1980, drew comparisons to the Marathon of Hope runner who became a Canadian icon. While praising Howard's efforts to raise money and awareness, the senator said he believed that ""an awful lot more needs to be done"" at the political level to combat the financial and emotional difficulties that face those dealing with autism. Howard reassured supporters that he still intended to reach Victoria, B.C. before December 31. ""The challenges are great,"" he confessed ""but as long as the determination is greater, anything can be achieved"". Terry Robinson, a two-time Canadian Paralympic contender born with cerebral palsy, pledged to follow Howard's journey two weeks ago on its three-month leg from Ottawa to Winnipeg. Robinson addressed the city, speaking about how his own disabilities left him with an appreciation for how important it was to ensure that people struggling with autism had access to services that could support them."

Her travels culminated in a visit on Monday to Spring Brook Elementary School, where as a fourth-grader she set the goal of some day being an Olympian. Schaus's dream was fulfilled this year during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, when she played for the US women's ice hockey team and won a silver medal. As she addressed and answered questions from students and teachers at the grade school, Schaus explained the large amount of work she had to invest to achieve her goals. The Chicago Daily Herald reports that ""she has been practicing for three to four hours a day nearly every day for the past year."" She told the students to ""make a dream and follow it because you never know what can happen and just have fun with it."" The nostalgic visit to her elementary school followed a weekend of other appearances in Naperville, including a celebration last Saturday at Rosebud's Italian Specialties and Pizzeria. Saturday had been declared Molly Schaus Day by Naperville Mayor A. George Pradel, who also gave Schaus a key to the city. Schaus has not been the only Olympic alumnus to return to the school; figure skater and gold medalist Evan Lysacek returned to his Naperville hometown and spoke to the students at Spring Brook on March 26. ""It's amazing we had two Olympians come to our school. It's like 1 million to one that they both get medals,"" remarked fourth-grader Alexandra Van Cleave. Schaus lived in Naperville until moving to Massachusetts during her sophomore year in high school, having attended Gregory Middle School for junior high and Benet Academy during her freshman year of high school. After speaking at Spring Brook on Monday, she visited Gregory later that day and then went home to Massachusetts. She is expected to visit the White House with the rest of her team later this year. She will also start preparing for her final season at Boston College."
sport,"Spain Juan Antonio Samaranch, former head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has died in Barcelona at the age of 89. A former diplomat and Spanish ambassador in Moscow elected to the IOC in 1980, Samaranch was largely credited with the renewal of the Olympic movement over two decades marked by boycotts, bribery and drug scandals. While appearing to be small in stature and uncomfortable speaking in public, he was viewed as an often ruthless operator who could forge consensus within an often fractious Olympic movement and bring IOC members to deliver what he wanted. Samaranch was admitted to hospital on Sunday with heart trouble and died at approximately 11:25 UTC, marking one of a number of occasions he has fallen ill. Even in retirement, with advancing age and medical issues, Samaranch continued to travel and be active in Olympic circles, working to try and secure both the 2012 Olympics and 2016 Olympics for Madrid as well as attending various sport conferences. ""I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic Family,"" current IOC president Jacques Rogge was quoted as saying, also making mention of the personal inspiration he drew from Samaranch. During his time in office, Samaranch worked to help increase the number of participating countries at the Olympics, oversaw the creation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the creation of the IOC Athletes Commission. Prior to his election to the role of IOC president in 1980, he had a long background in sports, having held roles with the Spanish Skating Federation, Spanish National Olympic Committee and as Chef de Mission at the games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Rome and Tokyo."

The five were Louise Sauvage, Roberto Marson, Trischa Zorn-Hudson, Frank Ponta, and Chris Holmes. Between them, they have won 100 Paralympic medals. The ceremony was hosted by Chris Wadell, a Paralympic skier who was himself inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 2010 Winter Paralympics, alongside Sir Philip Craven, the current President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Louise Sauvage, an Australian Paralympic wheelchair racer, won thirteen Paralympic medals &amp;ndash; including nine gold medals, was presented by Sir Philip Craven with a set of pins from the last six summer Paralympics. She noted that she had been to all of them, and is currently in London as a coach. Two of her new protégées attended the Hall of Fame induction. Roberto Marson was an Italian athlete, fencer, and swimmer who won 26 Paralympic medals, including sixteen golds in his career, died last November. His award was a posthumous one, accepted on his behalf by his daughter. Trischa Zorn-Hudson, from the United States, is the most successful Paralympian of all time, having won 55 medals, of which 41 were gold. Her medal tally also included nine silver and five bronze. Today, she works with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; helping disabled veterans to achieve their potential. Wadell noted this brings the Paralympics full circle, the Games having began with disabled servicemen. Frank Ponta was an Australian athlete, swimmer, fencer, and basketball player, who was influential in the development of wheelchair sport in Australia. As an athlete, he won a silver medal at the first Paralympic games in Rome in 1960; as a coach, he trained the likes of Louise Sauvage and Priya Cooper. He died in June last year, and was another posthumous inductee. Finally, Chris Holmes, a British swimmer who won sixteen medals, including nine golds, during his Paralympic career. He is very busy these days with, in his words, ""a sporting event that is going on in London at the moment"". This is the fourth time that Visa have hosted such an event. For the first time, the IPC invited members of the public to nominate athletes and coaches. Nominations also came from the national Paralympic committees, and international sporting bodies. The inductions are conducted every two years, alternating between winter and summer Paralympics. According to Sir Philip Craven, the Hall of Fame is both a way of celebrating sporting achievement, and of creating a sort of corporate memory. To be eligible, nominees must have competed in at least two games, the more the better; and won, or coached athletes who have won, multiple medals, again the more the better. They must have retired before the previous games, in this case before Beijing in 2008. However, the award also recognizes sportsmanship and service to the Paralympic community."

However, he only appeared in the introductory video and on the website, while the three others appear in costumed character form around the country, and as merchandise ""created in effigy by the thousands"". Only 205 Vancouver Island marmots are known to exist, due to predators (mostly wolves and eagles), and loggers. Writer Jeff Lee is asking readers to join their ""campaign to make him a real, live mascot instead of a virtual sidekick"". He's asking for public opinion to send to The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (or simply, ""Vanoc"") on why Mukmuk would make a good mascot, or even why he wouldn't. Lee will be regularly writing articles for the paper, as well as blogging, publishing reader thoughts, drawings, and ideas of ""who Mukmuk really is""; all the other characters have detailed back stories. According to press materials, ""Mukmuk is a small and friendly Vancouver Island marmot who always supports and cheers loudly for his friends during games and races. When he is not hibernating or sunbathing on rocks and logs, he enjoys getting out to meet other types of marmots and animals. In fact, this is how he became friends with the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic mascots."" The Vancouver Sun first received reader feedback sympathetic to Mukmuk, as a Nanaimo resident wrote in, noting their paper was the only one to even picture the character.

sport,"AS Roma CL2007 Manchester United advanced to the semi-finals of the Champions League after a thumping of Italian club AS Roma Tuesday night. Holding a 2-1 advantage after the first leg, Roma travelled to Old Trafford in hopes of knocking Manchester United out of the competition, ruining their hopes of a treble. The winning goal scorer from the first leg, Marko Vucinic, had to replace the ill Rodrigo Taddei for Roma, and he was paired with Roma's talisman striker Francesco Totti. Louis Saha was still out through injury for United, so Alan Smith started his fourth match of the season with strike partner Wayne Rooney. Roma started the match quite strongly with several attempts early. David Pizarro first blasted a long drive wide before Totti came close with a 25-yard shot. Michael Carrick then opened the scoring for United as he was supplied the ball by Ronaldo, and the Englishman's shot curled past Doni. Some quick counterattacking football then earned United their second goal as Brown, Rooney, Carrick, and Heinze all combined to get the ball out to Giggs. His pass into Smith left Doni exposed, and the striker scored his first goal since returning from injury. A third goal was scored only minutes later after play from Ronaldo and Smith released Giggs on the right, and his cross was turned in by Rooney off the post. Roma finally had a chance to respond through De Rossi, but his header from Pizarro's cross was sent over the bar. Ronaldo was then knocking on the door for Uniteds fourth, as he fizzled a shot just wide, and had a free kick blocked by a stretching Doni. The Portuguese winger would score just before the break however, as more good work by Giggs gave Ronaldo room to maneuver, and he sprinted in before firing a low shot into the corner. Van Der Sar was then called into action to bat away a hard free kick by Totti, but the scoreline stayed 4-0 into the break. Totti started off the chances in the second half with a free kick that went just wide, but United would score again only four minutes in. Giggs was again the supplier as his low cross was knocked in by a lunging Ronaldo, his twentieth goal of the season. Roma looked for a consolation goal, but it looked as if United would not even conceed that as Darren Fletcher cleared Allesandro Mancini's header off the line. Carrick then earned himself a brace on the night, as he blasted home a 25 yard drive into the top corner. Giggs was then replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the Norweigen nearly added another goal as he lofted the ball on to the top of the net. Roma finally got their goal in the 69th minute through Daniel De Rossi as his fine coushioned volley from Totti's cross was beyond Van Der Sar. Substitute Patrice Evra then rounded out the scoring in the 81'st minute after a nice interchange of play between himself, Solskjaer, and Rooney, the defender hit in a low shot off the post. Ronaldo, in search of a hat-trick, pushed forward near the end of the game, but his low drive was saved well by Doni. Manchester United will now move on to face either AC Milan or Bayern Munich in the next round of the Champions League, and their next match is the FA Cup semi-final against Watford. Roma meanwhile take on Sampdoria next in the Serie A, though they no longer have a chance to catch leaders Internazionale. bookings_away = Cassetti, Mexes (Yellow (2))"
sport,"Studies conducted by a team of physicists at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) conclude that new synthetic NBA basketballs are less lively, more slippery when damp, and bounce more erratically than the traditional leather balls. James Horwitz, Chairman of the UTA Department of Physics was contacted by the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to study the new ball. Horwitz asked UTA physics professor Kaushik De to lead the project. De's team found that the new balls are tackier when dry, but become much more slippery than leather balls when they get damp. Traditional leather basketballs provide more grip when they are slightly wet. The synthetic balls bounce 30% more sporadically, possibly due to deep embossing, and are less lively than leather basketballs. Some of these issues could be fixed with a variety of methods, including modification of the embossing, increasing the air pressure in the balls beyond the regulation 8.5 psi, and constantly drying the balls with towels during the game or frequently replacing them with fresh basketballs, say De and Horwitz."
sport,"The Suns had been on fire for the entire month of January. Unfortunately for them, Kevin Garnett was holding the extinguisher when the Suns came into the Target Center on Monday night. Garnett posted a double-double, scoring 44 points and snaring 11 rebounds, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 121-112. The loss prevented the Suns from posting a perfect record in the month of January, and ended the Suns' season-high 17-game winning streak. The Suns had problems answering Garnett's scoring prowess, but it was the Minnesota defense that doomed the Suns, limiting them to 17 points in the final quarter after allowing 95 from Phoenix in the first three periods. Steve Nash had 20 points and 18 assists, but in the fourth quarter he was only able to score 3 points and provide one assist. In the fourth quarter, it was simply the Kevin Garnett show. Garnett scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, with 13 of those points coming in the final 6:20 of the period. ""It's just about being a presence,"" Garnett said. ""It's about making them have to deal with me. I will continue to take that approach."" In addition to his 44-point night, Garnett helped his team by not turning the ball over at all during the game. Such a performance was not the case for Steve Nash, who turned the ball over an uncharacteristic five times during the game. The Suns had 14 turnovers as a team. It was a case of Garnett and the Timberwolves taking full advantage of the mistakes the Suns made and turning it into an opportunity to win. However, the loss certainly didn't leave the Suns or their coach, Mike D'Antoni, discouraged. ""We'll start another streak. This is fun."""

His family issued a statement saying, ""It is with profound sadness that the family of George M. Steinbrenner III announces his passing. He was an incredible and charitable man....He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports. He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion again."" Born on July 4, 1930, Steinbrenner, a former shipping magnate, bought the Yankees from CBS in 1973. As owner of the Yankees, he led the team to eleven American League pennants and seven World Series titles. Nicknamed ""The Boss,"" Steinbrenner pursued free agents with great fervor, signing Reggie Jackson to a five-year, US$3.5 million deal after the 1976 season. He also frequently changed managers, including firing and rehiring Billy Martin five times. Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in 1990 for paying US$400,000 to get information to discredit former Yankees outfielder David Winfield, but was reinstated in 1993. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered flags at City Hall Plaza to be lowered to half mast, saying, ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the entire Steinbrenner family. This is a sad day not only for Yankee fans, but for our entire city, as few people have had a bigger impact on New York over the past four decades than George Steinbrenner.""

Yankees legend Yogi Berra said, ""George was The Boss, make no mistake. He built the Yankees into champions and that's something nobody can ever deny. He was a very generous, caring, passionate man. George and I had our differences, but who didn't? We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much."" Current Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig said that he is ""very saddened"" to hear of the loss and added, ""George was a giant of the game and his devotion to baseball was surpassed only by his devotion to his family and his beloved New York Yankees....We will miss him, especially Tuesday night when the baseball family will be gathered at Angel Stadium for the All-Star Game."" Steinbrenner is survived by his wife Joan, two sisters, four children, including Hank and Hal, who took over Yankees operations in 2007, and his grandchildren. The Steinbrenner family said that he will have a private funeral and a public service would be held at a later date. His death comes at a time of great sadness for the Yankees, as two days earlier longtime Yankees public announcer Bob Sheppard died at 99."

The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 3-2 pitch, which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. Matt Murphy, a 22-year-old from Queens in New York City, got the ball and was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of San Francisco police officers. After Bonds finished his home-run trot, a ten-minute delay in the game marked the occasion. This included a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bonds on breaking the record which Aaron had held for 33 years. An impromptu emotional statement by Bonds on the field, with Willie Mays at his side, followed. ""I move over now and offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historic achievement,"" said Aaron in his video-taped statement, which was played on the scoreboard. After the game Bacsik said of Bonds, ""He's the greatest of all time ... Giving it up to Barry Bonds is nothing to be ashamed of.""

The operation extended across Brasilia, Sao Paulo and Macapa. The arrests were made following an operation involving up to 200 police officers. Five wanted officials remain at large. Federal Police allege the officials were involved in a scheme that has the potential to destabilise the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The group are said to have used up to units=millions—allocated in government funding to train almost 2000 taxi drivers, waiters and hotel staff in the lead-up to the events—for private gain. Federal Police say they intend to charge all 38 (including the five not yet apprehended) with criminal associations, fraud and embezzlement. If found guilty, they face up to twelve years imprisonment.

sport,"Manchester United F.C. bookings_away = Rooney, Carrick (Yellow (2)) Manchester United and Watford met Saturday at the neutral ground of Villa Park for the semi-final of the FA Cup. Both teams went into the game on highs, as United had thrashed Roma 7-1 during the week, and Watford had defeated Portsmouth 4-2 in the Premiership. With that confidence boost for Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd, Watford sported an attacking lineup with Hameur Bouazza and Tamas Priskin as strikers. United's recent injury troubles allowed Alan Smith to play as strike partner to Wayne Rooney with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on the bench. The first chance in the match fell to United, and the Red Devils capitalized. A long ball by Carrick was left by both Smith and Giggs before it came to Rooney, and he cut inside before blasting a shot high to the right of Richard Lee, giving United an early lead. Watford were not dispirited by the early goal, and soon began to create chances through set pieces. A flailing boot by a Watford player in the area connected with Edwin Van Der Sar's recently healed nose, and the big Dutch keeper had to have splints put in before play could continue. Watford took advantage of the stoppage to catch their breath, and scored as soon as play resumed when Hameur Bouazza's side footed volley caught Van Der Sar unaware, and crept in off the crossbar after deflecting off Gabriel Heinze. United's response was nearly instant, as Smith's pass into Rooney released him on the right. After Lee nearly blocked a pass into Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger was able to bobble the ball home, scoring his twenty-first goal of the season, and restoring United's lead. Gavin Mahon then had a chance to equalize again for Watford, but his side footed volley was saved by Van Der Sar. Ronaldo then had a chance for his second as he was released by Rooney, but a last ditch tackle by DeMerit kept the scoreline at 2-1. A groin injury for United's Rio Ferdinand then forced Alex Ferguson to replace him with Darren Fletcher, a move which saw a shuffle in the entire back line. Rooney then had a chance for a brace, but his hard shot was palmed away by Lee. Watford started the second half strongly with Bouazza nearly scoring off a long throw, but his side footed effort went just wide. Alan Smith then set up Rooney's second goal of the match as his curling cross was easily deflected in by Rooney's left foot. Cristiano Ronaldo was then replaced with Kieran Richardson, and the substitute made nearly an instant impact, scoring United's fourth goal of the afternoon. A well timed pass by Smith was met by the sprinting Richardson, and he easily chipped the ball over Lee and into the back of the net to secure a place in the final for United. Relegation bound Watford will meet Blackburn in the Premiership next, while United have a league game of their own at Old Trafford against Sheffield United."

Landis, who came in first on this year’s Tour de France, has previously tested positive for an abnormally high testosterone balance in his blood stream. This led to claims that he was involved with doping, in order to improve performance.

sport,"Strong road victories for the Columbus Crew and the Chicago Fire strengthened their positions at the top of the stacked Eastern Conference, while in the Western Conference defending champions Houston Dynamo became the final team to record a win. Columbus trailed the San Jose Earthquakes going into the 73rd minute, before a double-salvo by Robbie Rogers and a first of the season for Brad Evans handed the Crew a 3-1 lead. A consolation from the Earthquakes could not prevent Columbus securing a fifth consecutive win. Chicago Fire are just 2 points off Columbus' tail after they defeated D.C. United 2-0 at RFK Stadium. A cool side-footed finish by Justin Mapp opened the scoring for the visitors, and a spectacular 30 yard drive by Cuauhtemoc Blanco sealed a 4th defeat in 5 for DC, who were without Designated Player Marcelo Gallardo. DC United are now 4 points adrift at the bottom of the Eastern Conference. Elsewhere in the Eastern Conference, both New England Revolution and the New York Red Bulls boosted their early season play-off hopes with victories in Los Angeles. New York defeated LA Galaxy 2-1, with Juan Pablo Angel bagging the game-winner and his first of the season. The Red Bulls had taken the lead in the first half through rookie Danleigh Borman's first career goal, before Alan Gordon equalised for the Galaxy. However, almost immediately from the restart Dane Richards drove down the pitch and slid Angel in, who subsequently rounded Cronin and slotted home. In the second game at the Home Depot Center in Week 7, Taylor Twellman announced his return from injury with the 2nd goal in New England Revolution's 2-1 win over Chivas USA. Gambian teenager Kenny Mansally had put the Revs in front with his 2nd of the season, and Twellman's left-footed strike gave New England a 2-0 advantage. It proved crucial as Justin Braun netted his first career goal in injury time to give Chivas USA only a consolation. Out in the Western Conference, leaders, the Colorado Rapids, succumbed to an ill-tempered 2-1 defeat to the Houston Dynamo. Omar Cummings' equaliser for the Rapids was sandwiched between Brian Ching and Dwayne De Rosario strikes for the 2007 Champions, who became the last team in this year's competition to record a victory. The Rapids remain top of the Western Conference with 9 points. In the 2nd all-West match-up, Real Salt Lake continued their fine home form with a 2-1 success over FC Dallas. Argentine playmaker Javier Morales built on a two-assist performance last week with the opening goal at Rice-Eccles Stadium. While Kenny Cooper would equalise for Dallas with a well taken strike from an acute angle, Kyle Beckerman got a touch to Andy Williams' deft through ball to hand RSL just their 2nd win of the season."

Yet with a lot of determination and a strong defense, the Benet Academy varsity boys basketball team defeated the Rams 68–54. The game marks Benet's sixteenth straight victory this season, giving the Redwings a 26–3 overall record. It is also their first sectional championship since the 1982–1983 season, which was the last time Benet advanced to the Class AA state tournament; there they lost to Thornton Township High School in the quarterfinals. The Redwings' aggressive man-to-man defense certainly kept the Rams out of their comfort zone amidst the crowds in the sold-out Neuqua gym. As Benet forward Mike Runger said, ""We made them play to their weaknesses instead of letting them get comfortable doing what they want to do.” Benet scored 71 percent of its shots in the first half, while Glenbard East scored only 27. While the Rams led twice in the first few minutes (3–0 and 7–5), the Redwings led 12–7 after the first quarter. A three-point shot made by Dave Sobolewski two seconds before the buzzer gave Benet a 27–16 lead at the end of the first half. Glenbard East desperately attempted a comeback in the second half, but Benet maintained a lead ranging from 10 to 18 points. Rams guard made four three-pointers in the fourth quarter, but to no avail. As Benet coach Gene Heidkamp said, ""...we knew they were going to come at us and give us a ton of pressure.

sport,"With the home-crowd Russian fans on the side of the Italians, the United States defeated Italy in sledge hockey by a score of 5&amp;ndash;1 today in both teams' opening game at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. The United States started the first period with possession, but much of this was on their own third of the ice. Both teams did a full line change within the first minute of play following an Italian penalty by Bruno Balossetti that resulted in a United States power player. While the USA got possession on the penalty, it was after a few seconds where who had possession was questionable. The puck then changed possession several times. Both goalies had to work in the opening minutes of the game. With 12:20 left in the first, Italy had a fast break down the ice. In defending his goal, the Team USA goalie fell over and there was a mob in front of the goal trying to move the puck. The USA managed to prevent the Italians from scoring. Following this, there was a line change and a similar pile up in front of the Team USA net at 12:13. After a penalty that saw Andy Yohe get 2 minutes for roughing, the United States got possession. Both sides had their fans in arena, with several large Italian flags behind their team's bench. There were a pair of United States flags. When the Italians had the puck and looked likely to score, the multitude of Russian flags were waved and the fans cheered in support of the team. The United States allowed Italy to get possession after two players crashed into each other and had to untangle their sledges. At 10:20 left, Italy managed to get a shot on goal, which the USA goalie stopped. With 10:09, both teams were to full strength. There was another pile up, this time in front of the Italian net, at 9:12 left. The United States had problems passing during much of this time, and with keeping the puck out of their third. A United States fan was screaming at the team at one point shouting, ""Get it out."" Italy had several good chances but they were not able to capitalize on them. At 2:30 left, the United States and Italy were about equal with shots on goal: 4 for USA, 5 for Italy. At 2:30 left in the first, Valerio Corvino of Italy got 2 minutes in the penalty box for roughing. With 1:15, good passes by Nikko Landeros and Taylor Chance lead to a goal by Declan Farmer on a power player opportunity. Immediately following the goal, Italian Werner Winkler got a 2 minute penalty for roughing. The pace of the game slowed down in the final minutes, and there were fewer hits. The occasional United States fan chanted ""USA, USA, USA."" The first period ended 1&amp;ndash;0 in favour of the United States. The second period started with lots of Italian cheering from the stands, while the Americans possessed the puck on the Italian third of the ice. Both teams were shorthanded, each with a player in the penalty box. The penalties were over and both teams were at full strength by 14:10 left in the second. Early in the period, Italy got a two minute penalty for too many players on the ice. The United States also addressed possession problems they had in the first period and kept the puck in front of the Italian goal. Team USA still had problems with executing passes though. Whenever the Italians got possession of the puck and looked like they might have a remote chance of scoring, the Russian fans started cheering loudly. With 3:48 left in the second, Brody Roybal scored with an assist from Declan Farmer. With 1:18 left in the second, Guiseppe Condello got a 2 minute penalty for teeing when he rammed the front of his sledge into a USA player's sledge. The period ended 2&amp;ndash;0 in favour of the the United States. During the intermission, a Paralympic presenter went into the audience to talk to Team USA fans in the stands for the screens found on display in the arena. Following a little patter, she asked the fans to do the Team USA chant, which they did. In response to the requested, ""USA! USA! USA!"" chant, a number of people inside the arena booed. The third period started with Team USA possession. Early in the period, Taylor Chase had a 2 minute penalty for teeing, and both teams were shorthanded with 14:38 left in the third. Italy was back at full strength by 14:17. Despite the teeing penalty, the number of collisions appeared down from earlier in the game. Both teams were at full strength with 12:33 left in the third period. With 11:56 left in the third, Joshua Sweeney got the puck, moved it down the ice and then slid it past the Italian goalkeeper to score an unassisted goal. Midway through the third period, and most of the puck possession took place on the Italian third of the ice. With 4:42 left in the third, with assists from Joshua Pauls and Nikko Landeros, Brody Roybal scored on the Italians to little applause from people in the arena. The score was 4&amp;ndash;0. Following the goal, Team USA took a timeout and made a goalkeeper change, with Steve Cash out and Jen Lee in. With 3:26 left in the third, Team USA player Paul Schaus earned a 2 minute penalty for roughing. The Team USA goalie made a fantastic above-the-head glove save with 3:05 left in the third. With 1:26 left in the game, Italian Florian Planker scored off an assist from Gianluca Cavaliere. The stadium erupted into loud chanting, and lots of waving of Russian flags. Adam Page was injured with 1:08 left in the game, and left the ice to a round of applause from the fans. The United States's Paul Schaus scored off an assist from Nikko Landeros with just under 5 seconds left in the game, bringing the final score to 5&amp;ndash;1.

Ottmar Hitzfeld: “I’m very satisfied, we played well for long periods. Collecting three points was the important thing today. We had more of the possession and made the most of our opponents’ mistakes. The opening goal eased us mentally, but our opponents were boosted when they pulled one back. Our counter-attacks weren’t accurate enough, we wasted three or four chances. We’re still not as stable as we were at the start of the season. It was obvious we suffered an attack of nerves at the end. Ribéry was sensational again today, I took him aside for a one-hour motivational talk yesterday.“ Oliver Kahn: “Especially in the first half, we were a lot better than we have been in recent matches and we were a lot more passionate again. The way the breaks for internationals work always causes us problems. You have players appearing for their national teams, on Saturday and again on Wednesday, for Italy, France and Argentina, and that obviously takes its toll. There needs to be a discussion about overhauling the match calendar. It affects the battle for the German championship.“ Felix Magath: “It was good to be back at the Allianz Arena. I had the feeling we were holding out well in the first half-hour, but their opening goal indicated we’re not quite solid enough yet. We lost our shape for a while after that. We only pulled ourselves together after they went 2-0 up. We played with a lot of heart, but not a great deal of intelligence. We never found the right solutions. Bayern were well worth the win.“"

sport,"Anyone planning on attending the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China can forget about renting a car when they get there. Newspapers reported on September 18 that no private cars would be allowed near any of the venues in the host city, in an attempt to combat the gridlock that has plagued the city. Known for its stand-still traffic, Beijing's transport authority believes it needs to curb at least 20% of traffic flow to ensure the Games run smoothly. The number of cars in the city is set to increase from 2.7 million to 3 million by the time of the Olympics. Country-wide, annual car sales are expected to reach 10 million annually by 2010. A good infrastructure is one of the International Olympic Committee's top priorities when searching for bid cities. The IOC requires that athletes, support staff such as coaches, venue volunteers, spectators, and the press all should be able to get from venue to venue without hassle. Existing plans in Beijing say that private cars may only drive in the city on alternate days. Plates with odd numbers would drive one day, while even numbered licenses would drive the next day. Wired magazine has suggested fuel-cell vehicles may be China's next cultural revolution. Vancouver-based venture capitalist Mike Brown told the National Post: ""If they get aggressive about this, and they decided to build up a fuel cell manufacturing capability to sell half a million of these things, they'll get the costs down faster than anybody else."""
sport,"On Monday in Canberra, the Australian government released its annual budget, one that promises a A$1.5 billion surplus for the year, but little was said of the potential impact of the budget on Australian sport in an Olympic year when Australia is looking to earn the fewest medals since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. There were no apparent surprises for the sports sector in Australia in this budget. The budget, available online, claims A$380 million has been spent preparing for the 2012 Olympic Games. According to Keith Lyons, the University of Canberra Director of the National Institute of Sport Studies, sport is an important part of Australian culture and the development of sport enjoys bipartisan support. The sport ""budget supports infrastructure developments and reflects a renewal of Australian sport venues post Sydney Olympics 2000. The Active After School investment reflects a commitment to support participation and engagement in physical activity and sport."" When Tony Naar of the Australian Paralympic Committee was asked about the impact of the budget on his organisation's efforts, he said there was little to report as there were ""very few previously unannounced initiatives... the overall level of program funding was in line with the final year of the current funding cycle"". The budget promises to support cricket, specifically the 2015 Cricket World Cup, and soccer (football) with the 2015 Asian Cup by allocating funding for facility improvement. A$50 million will be spent on redeveloping the Sydney Cricket Ground, A$30 million on redeveloping the Adelaide Oval, and A$15 million on redeveloping the Bellerive Oval in Hobart."

The number of olympians may increase by 10, as the Committee has given a number of athletes a final chance to qualify, including Lidia Chojecka and Małgorzata Trybańska. There are 101 women and 157 men on the team. The 28-year-old canoer Marek Twardowski has been chosen for the national flag bearer. ""There was, of course, a discussion. We rejected the candidacy of Otylia Jędrzejczak, because she starts her Olympics on August 9, the same situation was with Leszek Blanik. We needed a titled sportsman for whom the function of flag bearer will not interrupt preparations. Marek starts on August 19, he won 20 World Championships and European Championships medals and he's a cool guy"", said Kajetan Broniewski, the chief of the Polish Olympic Mission. The Committee spent over PLN186 million (almost US$90 million) on preparations for the Olympics in last four years, with PLN73 million of it spent this year alone. ""With such a big team, we should improve the results from Athens and win over 10 medals"", said the PKOL president Piotr Nurowski. When asked about the protests over China's violation of human rights in Tibet, Nurowski said: ""Demonstrating one's political views at the venues as well as in the Olympic Village is forbidden. It is a violation of the Olympic Oath. It means that the IOC may even expel one from the Village and take away the medals. I have talked a lot about it with our sportsmen. They have answered that politics is not interesting for them in Beijing. They are concentrating on sports."" It will be the third biggest Polish Olympic team in history; there were more sportsmen at the Olympics in 1972 (Munich, 288) and 1980 (Moscow, 321). Fours years ago the team numbered 202 sportsmen. The players on the men's and women's volleyball teams, as well as the men's handball team are still not known.

Wikinews Hello I'm interviewing David Casinos, Spain's most famous track and field athlete in Paralympic sport, for Wikinews. So you're competing at the IPC World Championships are going to win a whole lot of medals? Which medals are you going to win? ::David Casinos :Bueno, me gustaría sobre todo, primero hacerlo bien, eso significaría que voy a acercarme a esas medallas. Soy muy humilde en ese aspecto. WNIQ As somebody who's been competing a long time in track and field, how has stuff changed form when you first started out to now? ::David Casinos: El mayor cambio que he vivido yo ha sido la comunicación, pero sobre todo el Plan ADO Paralímpico. Profesionalizar el Plan ADO. Ser deportistas profesionales. El deporte paralímpico español es más conocido ahora por los medios de comunicación y en el mundo entero. WNIQ Have there been more opportunities for sponsorship as your Paralympics profile has grown? ::David Casinos: Yes! WNIQ Would you like to promote a few of them? ::David Casinos: Tengo bastantes patrocinadores, uno de ellos es Toro Loco, una bebida energética, Diputación de Valencia, Fundación Trinidad Alfonso, que es de Juan Roig, Mercadona, Moncada, mi ayuntamiento, Valencia Terra i Mar... Igual me olvido de alguno ahora. Tengo varios. WNIQ Resulta que los australianos han hecho que los patrocinadores patrocinen sus zapatos. ¿Esto pasa en los atletas españoles también? ::David Casinos: No. No sucede. WNIQ Is this going to be an issue? I mean is Spain at the level where it can become an issue? ::David Casinos: Yo por ejemplo tengo un patrocinador muy grande, se llama Macrón Sports, italiano, y es patrocinador de la liga italiana, la española, de fútbol, y yo tengo su patrocinador. Yo no tengo ese problema. Me siento muy arropado. WNIQ Okay. So, you're a visual-impaired athlete, and do you run with a guide? ::David Casinos: No corro con un guía, pero sí necesito a ese guía para hacer series, saltar, hacer todo lo que tengo que hacer, para lanzar lejos. WNIQ How helpful are guides in terms of how much they potentially impact outcomes, do you think? ::David Casinos: Para mi el guía es una pieza fundamental en mi día a día. En la competición simplemente te ayudan a entrar y salir del círculo, lo demás lo haces tú, pero en el día a día, en el backstage que le digo yo, es el que te ayuda con las pesas, a saltar, acolocarte en el foso, hay más trabajo incluso, detrás de la competición. WNIQ Spain has a long history of blind sports, compared to other countries. Do you have an explanation as to why there are so many blind athletes? ::David Casinos: Bueno, en primer lugar tenemos la organización ONCE, que es la gran precursora de que las personas con discapacidad tengamos una serie de opciones, entre ellas el deporte. Y en ese aspecto ha sido la ONCE muy pionera. Pioneros absolutos. Y eso es bueno. Lo que pasa es que ahora otros países están descubriendo sus paralímpicos. WNIQ Is there anything you think an international audience should know about you or the Paralympic movement in Spain? ::David Casinos: Soy un deportista más, que lucha por mi sueño, que es el deporte, superarme, día a día, después de una gran dificultad que ha sido perder la visión. Y este mensaje es el que me gusta transmitir a muchas personas mediante el coaching. WNIQ Okay. ¡Muchas gracias! ::David Casinos: Okay!"

sport,"2012 Olympic Paralympics London, England&amp;mdash; A 62 points to 37 quarter-final win against Mexico on Tuesday night saw Australia's Gliders go forward into the medal round in front of a four-thousand-plus crowd at the Greenwich North Arena. Winners of their group, Australia have never taken the gold in wheelchair basketball; their opponents, Mexico, were previously ranked ninth at the opening of the tournament, so making it thus-far boosts their ranking to eighth. They were, however, beaten by Australia 75 points to 45 in a pre-tournament warm up match. Australia's first shot at goal was taken by Bridie Kean, from the free throw line; but, she missed both shots. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then became the opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, their biggest of the entire game. Seconds later, Cobo Crispin had a shot from the paint, but missed; Kylie Gauci then finally put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Cobi Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Kylie Gauci. This was repeated on the next play, with Sarah Stewart providing the assist. Mexico then scored, the Gliders responding with another shot from Cobi Crispin. On the next play, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Clare Nott took a defensive rebound, leading to Cobi Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled. but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Sarah Stewart took another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14 points to 4. Mexico had great difficulty moving the ball up the court; suffering by timing out, or being forced into long shots that missed. But, when the same happened to the Gliders, Kylie Gauci, a two-point player, took a spectacular three point shot to take the score to 17 points to 8 in Australia's favour. Mexico then managed to score again before Amber Merritt came on with only three minutes left in the quarter, and missed her first shot at goal. A second attempt, coming from a pass by Kylie Gauci, put more points on the scoreboard. With only a few seconds remaining in the quarter, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and delivered it to Shelley Chaplin, who scored again. The two teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10. In the opening minutes of the second quarter, Shelley Chaplin assisted Cobi Crispin, and then Amber Merritt, to add another four points. Attempting to respond, Mexico missed two shots before scoring then, on the next play, allowed Amanda Carter to steal the ball, which led to Amber Merritt scoring again. Australia followed this up with steals by Cobi Crispin and Amber Merritt, giving Shelley Chaplin more scoring opportunities. Mexico scored twice; but, Australia responded each time, with goals by Amber Merritt and Amanda Carter, who was fouled, making her's a three-point play. A steal led to a runaway break by Amber Merritt, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38 points to 16. Mexico seemed unable to shake a pattern of turnovers and hasty shots, resulting in a 44 to 20 points difference at the half-time break. In the third quarter, the Glider's intensity dropped off; A timeout, and a series of missed shots by Katie Hill, Brodie Kean and Cobi Crispin, gave Mexico a chance to stage a minor recovery by outscoring Australia for the quarter by one point, leaving the score at 50 to 27 at the end of the third quarter. The final quarter got off to an unimpressive start for both teams; Australia's Leanne del Toso missed a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal missed one at the the other. Sarah Stewart missed too before a Mexican turnover led to the first scoring of the quarter, by Sarah Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response, another shot by Sarah Stewart missed; but, Amanda Carter took an offensive rebound, which eventually made it into the basket. Turnovers by Bridie Kean and Leanne del Toso led Mexico putting points on the board consecutively, but successive fouls sent Bridie Kean to the free throw line to score three points. Amber Merritt brought the score to 59 points to 35 with her seventh scoring shot. By this point, Australia was deliberately running down the clock, passing the ball around, and taking shots at the last minute. This led to several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Katie Hill, with Mexico unable to capitalise on the opportunities. Under intense Australian defensive pressure, Mexico missed shots and turned over the ball as-often as before. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Katie Hill took a two point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, the final score of 62 points to 37 meant the Mexican team's Paralympic campaign was over. Australia must now confront the winner of tonight's United States versus Canada game on Thursday."
sport,"sports Yesterday, Wikinews interviewed Steve Redhead, a Professor of Sports Media and Acting Head of School of Human Movement Studies at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, about the Australian women's national soccer team (Matildas), the Australian men's national soccer team (Socceroos) and the current differences between the state of women and men's soccer in Australia. The Socceroos are currently getting international attention following yesterday's 2014 FIFA World Cup draw which placed the 59th FIFA ranked team in the same group as top FIFA ranked Spain, fifteenth ranked Chile and the ninth ranked Netherlands. The Matildas were in the news late last month, following their AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2014 draw which saw them placed in the group with Japan, Vietnam and Jordan. With the competition scheduled to take place in May, the Matildas are looking to repeat their performance as AFC champions. Domestically, Australia's top women's club team Sydney FC finish third in the International Women’s Club Championship held in Japan this past week after defeating South American club champions Colo-Colo in a penalty shootout. Wikinews: The Socceroos are ranked 59th by FIFA. The Matildas are ranked 8th by FIFA in the latest rankings. Should media coverage correlate to team performance and international rankings? Is there an element of tall poppy syndrome in the coverage of the Socceroos? What other factors can be used to explain the relative differences in media attention other than performance? ::Steve Redhead: Women's sports performances are seen as less than men's &amp;mdash; deep structural sexism (globally replicated). WNIQ: What's the difference in style of play between the men and women's national teams? ::Steve Redhead: If we take soccer teams, with the newish rules on tackling from behind globally soccer has become almost a non-contact sport &amp;mdash; this has helped the women's game enormously and the styles of play don't differ very much at all. If you were from outer space watching games, you would not know that a game was being played by men or women at the top level. The big remaining difference is goalkeeping. Men's team goalkeepers are invariably way over six feet at the top level. Goalkeeping in the women's game looks different because of this difference. WNIQ: Why are the Matildas more successful in international competitions and ranking wise than the Socceroos? ::SR: Socceroos have been in decline since Hiddink stopped being coach. Aging team, no great young players coming through to replace the golden generation. No such problem with Matildas &amp;mdash; just steady improvement, and good coaching. WNIQ: Soccer is one of most popular spectator sports for women. Why do you think the W-League has been unable to capitalize on the female audience like netball has? ::SR: This is a difficult question &amp;mdash; I just think it is going to take time, and articles like this one &amp;mdash; it has been the same problem all over the world for women's football and increasing the audience is always difficult. WNIQ: Why do you think men don't watch the Matildas in the same numbers as they watch the Socceroos? ::SR: The soccer culture for men's football is long standing, there is a real history for the culture. Not so in the women's game. WNIQ: Do problems with A-League finances translate into broader problems for the W-League and its ability to attract investors? ::SR: Yes, I think so. But there is a deep structural sexism in the culture too. WNIQ: None of the Socceroos received DAS Direct Athlete Support grants from the Australian Sports Commission in the past year while almost every single player on the Matildas received DAS or SLGSfW Sports Leadership Grants and Scholarships for Women funding. What accounts for difference in Australian Sports Commission/Australian Institute of Sport funding and what would it take to change that? ::SR: Can't really answer that one. WNIQ: What role should the government play in encouraging media organizations, both newspapers and television networks, to cover women's soccer in Australia? ::SR: I think it does take federal government intervention &amp;mdash; educational programmes in sport long term, enforcement of equality legislation, etc. WNIQ: Does the media feed into traditional Australian gender stereotypes by not covering elite women's sports? ::SR: Yes it does. Media sports education is crucial. We do this here at Charles Sturt University in NSW and I did it at University of Brighton in the UK. WNIQ: Australia has a long history of a male-driven sporting narrative. How does this narrative play into current representations of men and women in Australian soccer? Does the cultural heritage of male-driven narratives make one national team more inherently authentic than the other? ::SR: No, but I think it does make it difficult for women's sport to build the narratives over a period of time. WNIQ: Do issues with the Matildas not receiving the same level of media recognition as the Socceroos play a role in the development and attention of other Australian national soccer teams like blind football at the Paralympic level, cerebral palsy football at the Paralympic level, Australian teams at the International Gay Games, deaf soccer teams at the Deaflympics, wheelchair soccer at the World Cup of Powerchair Football? ::SR: Yes, it is about equality &amp;mdash; there is so much discrimination in the coverage of sports teams."

Australia's Chris Bond contributed 15 goals towards Australia's scoreline. By contrast, the Australian defenders held Canada's Garett Hickling to just seven goals. At one point two Australian defenders trapped him in a corner, unable to move, which he appeared to find very frustrating.

In the second half we were closer to a second goal, although in the closing stages the pressure was intense again. It was a hard-fought victory – we weren’t as strong as we had been recently and we didn’t play as well on the counter-attack. This has been our hardest test so far.""

I have a left arm amputation and I'm a speed skier. WNIQ So you're one of the standing skiers. ::Vanessa Knight: Yes. WNIQ I've been asking a lot of Paralympic disability skiers, what is the craziest skier of the slope? The standing ones, the blind ones, or the mono skiers? ::Vanessa Knight: Oh my God, the blind ones for sure. I couldn't imagine throwing myself down a hill without seeing anything.

WNIQ You're not competing? ::Jessica Gallagher: No. WNIQ You're just here? ::Jessica Gallagher: We're in training. I've got a race at Winner Park, but we aren't racing at Copper. WNIQ So. Your guide is Eric Bickerton, and he did win a medal in women's downhill blind skiing. ::Jessica Gallagher: Yes! WNIQ Despite the fact that he is neither a woman nor blind. ::Jessica Gallagher: No, he loves telling people that he was the first Australian female Paralympic woman to win a medal. One of the ironies. WNIQ The IPC's website doesn't list guides on their medal things. Are they doing that because they don't want &amp;mdash; you realise this is not all about you per se &amp;mdash; Is it because they are trying to keep off the able bodied people to make the Paralympics seem more pure for people with disabilities? ::Jessica Gallagher: Look, I don't know but I completely disagree if they don't have the guides up there. Because it's pretty plain and simple: I wouldn't be skiing if it wasn't with him. Being legally blind you do have limitations and that's just reality. We're certainly able to overcome most of them. And when it comes to skiing on a mountain the reason I'm able to overcome having 8 per cent vision is that I have a guide. So I think it's pretty poor if they don't have the information up there because he does as much work as I do. He's an athlete as much as I am. If he crashes we're both out. He's drug tested. He's as important as I am on a race course. So I would strongly hope that they would put it up there. Here's Eric! ::Eric Bickerton: Pleased to met you. WNIQ We've been having a great debate about whether or not you've won a medal in women's blind downhill skiing. ::Eric Bickerton: Yes, I won it. I've got it. WNIQ I found a picture of you on the ABC web site. Both of you were there, holding your medals up. The IPC's web site doesn't credit you. ::Jessica Gallagher: I'm surprised by that. ::Eric Bickerton: That's unusual, yeah.

How does a blind skier deal with... ::Jessica Gallagher: Funny now. Was bloody scary. WNIQ What race was that? ::Jessica Gallagher: It was the Giant Slalom in Vancouver at the Paralympics. Actually, we were talking about this before. It's one of the unique aspects of wearing headsets and being able to communicate. All the time while we were on the mountain earlier today, Eric had a stack and all he could hear as he was tumbling down was me laughing. ::Eric Bickerton: Yes... I wasn't feeling the love. ::Jessica Gallagher: But um... what was the question please? WNIQ I couldn't imagine anything scarier than charging down the mountain at high speed and losing that communications link. ::Jessica Gallagher: The difficulty was in the Giant Slalom, it was raining, and being used to ski racing, I had never experienced skiing in the rain, and as soon as I came out of the start hut I lost all my sight, which is something that I had never experienced before. Only having 8 per cent you treasure it and to lose all of it was a huge shock. And then when I couldn't hear Eric talking I realised that our headsets had malfunctioned because they'd actually got rain into them. Which normally wouldn't happen in the mountains because it would be snow. So it was the scariest moment of my life. Going down it was about getting to the bottom in one piece, not racing to win a medal, which was pretty difficult I guess or frustrating, given that it was the Paralympics. WNIQ I asked the standing guys upstairs: who is the craziest amongst all you skiers: the ones who can't see, the ones on the mono skis, or the one-legged or no-armed guys. Who is the craziest one on the slopes? ::Jessica Gallagher: I think the completely blind. If I was completely blind I wouldn't ski. Some of the sit skiers are pretty crazy as well. WNIQ You have full control over your skis though. You have both legs and both arms. ::Jessica Gallagher: True, but you've got absolutely no idea where you're going. And you have to have complete reliance on a person. Trust that they are able to give you the right directions. That you are actually going in the right direction. It's difficult with the sight that I have but I couldn't imagine doing it with no sight at all. WNIQ The two of you train together all the time? ::Eric Bickerton: Pretty well, yes. ::Jessica Gallagher: Yes, everything on snow basically is together. One of the difficult things I guess is we have to have that 100 per cent communication and trust between one another and a lot of the female skiers on the circuit, their guide is their husband. That's kind of a trust relationship. Eric does say that at times it feels like we're married, but... ::Eric Bickerton: I keep checking for my wallet. ::Jessica Gallagher: ...it's always about constantly trying to continue to build that relationship so that eventually I just... You put your life in his hands and whatever he says, you do, kind of thing. WNIQ Of the two sport, winter sports and summer sports person, how do you find that balance between one sport and the other sport? ::Jessica Gallagher: It's not easy. Yeah, it's not easy at all. Yesterday was my first day on snow since March 16, 2010. And that was mainly because of the build up obviously for London and the times when I was going to ski I was injured. So, to not have skied for that long is obviously a huge disadvantage when all the girls have been racing the circuit since... and it's vice versa with track and field. So I've got an amazing team at the Victorian Institute of Sport. I call them my little A Team of strength and mission coach, physio, osteopath, soft tissue therapist, sport psychologist, dietician. Basically everyone has expertise in the area and we come together and having meetings and plan four years ahead and say at the moment Sochi's the goal, but Rio's still in the back of the head, and knowing my body so well now that I've done both sports for five years means that I can know where they've made mistakes, and I know where things have gone really well, so we can plan ahead for that and prepare so that the things that did go wrong won't happen again. To make sure that I get to each competition in peak tone. WNIQ What things went wrong? ::Jessica Gallagher: Mainly injuries. So, that's the most difficult thing with doing two sports. Track and field is an explosive power; long jump and javelin are over four to six seconds of maximum effort. Ski racing, you are on a course, for a minute to a minute and a half, so it's a speed endurance event. And the two couldn't be further apart in terms of the capabilities and the capacities that you need as an athlete. So one of the big things I guess, after the Vancouver campaign, being in ski boots for so long, I had lost a lot of muscle from my calves so they weren't actually firing properly, and when you're trying to run and jump and you don't have half of your leg working properly it makes it pretty difficult to jump a good distance. Those kind of things. So I'm skiing now but when I'm in a gym doing recovery and rehab or prehab stuff, I've got calf raising, I've got hamstring exercises because I know they're the weaker areas that if I'm not working on at the moment they're two muscle groups that don't get worked during ski. That I need to do the extra stuff on the side so that when I transition back to track and field I don't have any soft tissue injuries like strains because of the fact that I know they're weaker so... WNIQ Do you prefer one over the other? Do you say ""I'd really rather be out on the slopes than jogging and jumping the same... ::Jessica Gallagher: I get asked that a lot. I think I love them for different reasons and I hate them for different reasons so I think at the end of the day I would prefer ski racing mainly because of the lifestyle. I think ski racing is a lot harder than track and field to medal in but I love the fact that I get to come to amazing resorts and get to travel the world. But I think, at the end of the day I get the best of both worlds. By the time my body has had enough of cold weather and of traveling I get to go home and be in the summer and be on a track in such a stable environment, which is something that visually impaired people love because it's familiar and you know what to expect. Whereas in this environment it's not, every racecourse we use is completely different. WNIQ I heard you were an average snowboarder. How disappointed were you when you when they said no to your classifications? ::Jessica Gallagher: Very disappointed! For Sochi you mean? WNIQ Yes ::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. I mean we weren't really expecting it. Mainly because they've brought in snowboard cross, and I couldn't imagine four blind athletes and four guides going down the same course together at the same time. That would be a disaster waiting to happen. But I guess having been a snowboarder for... as soon as we found snowboarding had been put in, I rang Steve, the head coach, and said can we do snowboarding? When I rang Steve I said, don't worry, I've already found out that Eric can snowboard. It would have been amazing to have been able to compete in both. Maybe next games. WNIQ So you also snowboard? ::Eric Bickerton: Yes. WNIQ So she does a lot of sports and you also do a crazy number of sports? ::Eric Bickerton: Uh, yeah? WNIQ Summer sports as well as winter sports? ::Eric Bickerton: Me? WNIQ Yes. ::Eric Bickerton: Through my sporting career. I've played rugby union, rugby league, soccer, early days, I played for the Australian Colts, overseas, rugby union. I spend most of my life sailing competitively and socially. Snow skiing. Yeah. Kite boarding and trying to surf again. WNIQ That's a lot of sports! Does Jessica need guides for all of them? ::Eric Bickerton: I've played sport all my life. I started with cricket. I've played competition squash. I raced for Australia in surfing sailing. Played rugby union. WNIQ Most of us have played sport all our lives, but there's a difference between playing sport and playing sport at a high level, and the higher level you go, the more specialized you tend to become. And here we're looking at two exceptions to that. ::Eric Bickerton: I suppose that I can round that out by saying to you that I don't think that I would ever reach the pinnacle. I'm not prepared to spend ten years dedicated to that one thing. And to get that last ten per cent or five percent of performance at that level. That's what you've got to do. So I'll play everything to a reasonable level, but to get to that really, really highest peak level you have to give up everything else. WNIQ When you go to the pub, do your mates make fun of you for having a medal in women's blind skiing? ::Eric Bickerton: No, not really. ::Jessica Gallagher: Usually they say ""I love it!"" and ""This is pretty cool!"" ::Eric Bickerton: We started at the Olympics. We went out into the crowd to meet Jess' mum, and we had our medals. There were two of us and we were waiting for her mum to come back and in that two hour period there was at least a hundred and fifty people from all over the world who wore our medals and took photographs. My medal's been all over Australia. WNIQ Going to a completely different issue, blind sports have three classifications, that are medical, unlike everybody else, who've got functional ability classifications. You've got the only medical ones. Do you think the blind classifications are fair in terms of how they operate? Or should there be changes? And how that works in terms of the IPC? ::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. I think the system they've got in place is good, in terms of having the three classes. You've got completely blind which are B1s, less than 5 percent, which are B2, and less than 10 percent is a B3. I think those systems work really well. I guess one of the difficult things with vision impairment is that there are so many diseases and conditions that everyone's sight is completely different, and they have that problem with the other classes as well. But in terms of the class system itself I think having the three works really well. What do you think? ::Eric Bickerton: I think the classification system itself's fine. It's the one or two grey areas, people: are they there or are they there? WNIQ That affected you in Beijing. ::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. That was obviously really disappointing, but, ironic as well in that one of my eyes is point zero one of a percent too sighted, so one's eligible, the other's just outside their criteria, which left me unable to compete. Because my condition is degenerative. They knew that my sight would get worse. I guess I was in a fortunate position where once my sight deteriorated I was going to become eligible. There are some of the classes, if you don't have a degenerate condition, that's not possible. No one ever wants to lose their best sight, but that was one positive. WNIQ On some national competitions they have a B4 class. Do you think those should be eligible? In terms of the international competition? ::Jessica Gallagher: Which sports have B4s? WNIQ There's a level down, it's not used internationally, I think it's only used for domestic competitions. I know the UK uses it. ::Jessica Gallagher: I think I... A particular one. For social reasons, that's a great thing, but I think if it's, yeah. I don't know if I would... I think socially to get more Paralympic athletes involved in the sport if they've got a degenerative condition on that border then they should be allowed to compete but obviously... I don't think they should be able to receive any medals at a national competition or anything like that. So I was, after Beijing, I was able to fore-run races. I was able to transition over to skiing even though at that stage I wasn't eligible. So that was great for us. The IPC knew that my eyesight was going to get worse. So I was able to fore-run races. Which was a really good experience for us, when we did get to that level. So I think, with the lack of numbers in Paralympic sport, more that you should encourage athletes and give them those opportunities, it's a great thing. But I guess it's about the athletes realizing that you're in it for the participation, and to grow as an athlete rather than to win medals. I don't think the system should be changed. I think three classes is enough. Where the B3 line is compared with a B4 is legally blind. And I think that covers everything. I think that's the stage where you have low enough vision to be considered a Paralympic sport as opposed to I guess an able bodied athlete. And that's with all forms of like, with government pensions, with bus passes, all that sort of stuff, that the cut off line is legally blind, so I think that's a good place to keep it. WNIQ Veering away from this, I remember watching the Melbourne Cup stuff on television, and there you were, I think you were wearing some hat or something. ::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah, my friend's a milliner. They were real flowers, real orchids. WNIQ Are you basically a professional athlete who has enough money or sponsorship to do that sort of stuff? I was saying, there's Jessica Gallagher! She was in London! That's so cool! ::Jessica Gallagher: There are two organizations that I'm an ambassador for, and one of them is Vision Australia, who were a charity for the Melbourne Cup Carnival. So as part of my ambassador role I was at the races helping them raise money. And that involves media stuff, so that was the reason I was there. I didn't get paid. WNIQ But if you're not getting paid to be a sponsor for all that is awesome in Australia, what do you do outside of skiing, and the long jump, and the javelin? ::Jessica Gallagher: I'm an osteopath. So I finished my masters' degree in 2009. I was completing a bachelor's and a masters. I was working for the Victorian Institute of Sport guiding program but with the commitment to London having so much travel I actually just put everything on hold in terms of my osteo career. There's not really enough time. And then the ambassador role, I had a few commitments with that, and I did motivational speaking. WNIQ That's very cool. Eric, I've read that you work as a guide in back country skiing, and all sorts of crazy stuff like that. What do you do when you're not leading Jessica Gallagher down a ski slope? ::Eric Bickerton: I'm the Chief Executive of Disabled Winter Sports Australia. So we look after all the disability winter sports, except for the Paralympics. ::Jessica Gallagher: Social, recreational... WNIQ You like that? You find it fulfilling? ::Eric Bickerton: The skiing aspect's good. I dunno about the corporate stuff. I could give that a miss. But I think it is quite fulfilling. Yeah, they're a very good group of people there who enjoy themselves, both in disabilities and able bodied. We really need guides and support staff. WNIQ Has it changed over the last few years? ::Eric Bickerton: For us? WNIQ Being a guide in general? How things have changed or improved, have you been given more recognition? ::Eric Bickerton: No. I don't see myself as an athlete. Legally we are the athlete. If I fail, she fails. We ski the exact same course. But there's some idiosyncrasies associated with it. Because I'm a male guiding, I have to ski on male skis, which are different to female skis, which means my turn shape I have to control differently so it's the same as her turn shape. It's a little bit silly. Whereas if I was a female guiding, I'd be on exactly the same skis, and we'd be able to ski exactly the same all the way through. In that context I think the fact that Jess won the medal opened the eyes to the APC about visual impairment as a definite medal contending aspect. The biggest impediment to the whole process is how the Hell do you get a guide who's (a) capable, (b) available and (c) able to fund himself. So we're fortunate that the APC pushed for the recognition of myself as an athlete, and because we have the medal from the previous Olympics, we're now tier one, so we get the government funding all way through. Without that two years before the last games, that cost me fifteen, sixteen months of my time, and $40,000 of cash to be the guide. So while I enjoyed it, and well I did, it is very very hard to say that a guide could make a career out of being a guide. There needs to be a little bit more consideration of that, a bit like the IPC saying no you're not a medal winner. It's quite a silly situation where it's written into the rules that you are both the athlete and yet at the same time you're not a medal winner. I think there's evolution. It's growing. It's changing. It's very, very difficult. WNIQ Are you guys happy with the media coverage on the winter side? Do you think there's a bias &amp;mdash; obviously there is a bias towards the Summer Paralympics. Do the winter people get a fair shake? ::Eric Bickerton: I think it's fair. It's reasonable. And there's certainly a lot more than what it used to be. Winter sports in general, just from an Australian perspective is something that's not well covered. But I'd say the coverage from the last Paralympics, the Para Winter Olympics was great, as far as an evolution of the coverage goes. WNIQ Nothing like winning a medal, though, to lift the profile of a sport. ::Jessica Gallagher: And I think that certainly helped after Vancouver. Not just Paralympics but able bodied with Lydia Lassila and Torah Bright winning, and then to have Eric and I win a medal, to finally have an Aussie female who has a winter Paralympic medal. I guess there can be misconceptions, I mean the winter team is so small in comparison to the summer team, they are always going to have a lot more coverage just purely based on numbers. There were 160 Australian athletes that were at London and not going to be many of us in Sochi. Sorry. Not even ten, actually. ::Eric Bickerton: There's five athletes. ::Jessica Gallagher: There's five at the moment, yeah. So a lot of the time I think with Paralympic sport, at the moment, APC are doing great things to get a lot of coverage for the team and that, but I think also individually, it's growing. I've certainly noticed a lot more over the past two years but Eric and I are in a very unique situation. For me as well being both a summer and a winter Paralympian, there's more interest I guess. I think with London it opened Australia and the word's eyes to Paralympic sport, so the coverage from that hopefully will continue through Sochi and I'll get a lot more people covered, but I know prior to Beijing and Vancouver, compared to my build up to London, in terms of media, it was worlds apart in terms of the amount of things I did and the profile pieces that were created. So that was great to see that people are actually starting to understand and see what it's like."

sport,"COVID-19 On Tuesday, North Korean government announced it would not participate in the delayed Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics ""to protect players from the world public health crisis caused by COVID-19"", the Associated Press reported. It is North Korea's first official withdrawal from Olympics since their boycott of the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, South Korea, CBS News reported. According to South Korea's Ministry of Unification, this is the first time North Korea withdrew from a major international sports event due to concerns of an infectious disease. Several athletes from multiple disciplines did not participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics over concerns of the Zika virus, but North Korea did. South Korean President Moon Jae-in had hoped the two nations could field a joint team similar to its unified Korean Peninsula team at the 2018 Winter Olympics, Al Jazeera reported. While North Korea claims to have no cases of the coronavirus, professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University Park Won Gon says it has shown ""a coronavirus-related neurosis since it declared an emergency anti-virus system in January last year"", adding it was very unlikely the country would be able to procure enough vaccines for its population by July, when the 2020 Olympics are scheduled to take place. In November, Daily NK reported North Korea had placed 81 thousand people, in quarantine excluding the soldiers in quarantine; and, by October 22, 32,011 people were placed in isolation. A source told Daily NK over 300 people had died in an isolation centre in Anju, South Pyongan. Director of Asian Studies at Temple University, Japan Campus Jeff Kingston told CBS this decision was a ""setback for diplomacy"". CBS also reported Seoul's disappointment at the nation's non-attendance, depriving South Korea a chance to discuss relations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Recently, North Korea's vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and sister of Kim Jong-un Kim Yo Jong warned March 16 ""the peaceful spring days of three years ago are unlikely to return"", calling South Korean leaders as ""all born with stupidity"" and they ""have become the dumb and deaf bereft of judgment"". The warning came after the United States and South Korea held joint military drills in March. This also comes after North Korea tested two ballistic missile on March 24, described by former admiral of the Japanese fleet Yoji Koda as ""just the beginning of North Korean fervour."" North Korea participated in the boycotts of the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and 1988 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."

Dana Hussain, one of the sprinters who would have been on the Iraqi team, was reported to be distraught by the decision. According to her coach she was ""crying for about two hours."" Her coach compared the decision to ""finding out that a close relative has died."" The deadline to register for five of the seven would-be Iraqi Olympians has passed. However, if the National Olympic Committee of Iraq is reinstated, the possibility exists that its two sprinters may be able to compete, if they register before the track and field deadline at the end of July."

Pompey had defeated Manchester United 1-0 in the quarter-finals to advance to this stage, while West Brom crushed Bristol Rovers 5-1 to advance to this stage. West Brom started the game strongly, with their first chance coming when Zolton Gera shot the ball right and David James who couldn't hold on, and the ball had to be hacked clear by Sol Campbell. The Baggies dominated the midfield for much of the first half and Portsmouth had to play off the counter-attack, but couldn't produce any good chances. Portsmouth began to gain steam nearing halftime, but neither team would score in the first period. After the break it was Portsmouth who took the lead through Kanu. A miscommunication between defender and goalkeeper occurred after Kiely made a fine save off Milan Baros. The ball ended up at Kanu's feet around five yards away from the goal, and the Nigerian side footed the ball calmly into the corner. After their goal Portsmouth began to control the match, but West Brom still get their chances as Robert Koren smashes a shot off the crossbar. West Brom pushed for the equalizer near the end of the match, but the Portsmouth defense stood firm and will now await the winner of Barnsley v Cardiff to see who they will take on at Wembley in the final."

sport,"A little over 100 days before the scheduled start of the 2016 Summer Olympics, on Thursday the Olympic flame was ignited in a ceremony at the temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. Actress Katerina Lehu played the role of priestess accompanied by fourteen virgins, lighting the flame at solar noon using sunlight focused by a parabolic mirror. After lighting the ""sacred fire"" Lehu passed it to its first bearer, gymnast Lefteris Petrunias. According to El País, another torchbearer is to be a Syrian refugee, bearing it in the Eleonas refugee camp. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said the lighting ceremony was writing history, and the Olympic Games would bring a message of hope in difficult times to Brazil and to the whole world. Over six days, the Olympic torch is to pass through more than 2000 kilometers of Greek territory, going through Marathon and the island of Corfu. This part of the ride ends at the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, site of the first modern Games of the Olympiad. Subsequently, the flame travels by plane to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne where it is to stay for a week. Later, on May 2, it is to be moved to Brasilia. The relay trip of the Olympic flame from Olympia to the Olympic site was introduced by Carl Diem in the Berlin 1936 Games."
sport,"Tottenham Hotspur bookings_away = Chimbonda (Yellow (1)) Tottenham Hotspur travelled to Upton Park earlier today to face West Ham United, currently the bottom team in the table. West Ham were 10 points adrift of relegation safety at kickoff, and desperately needed points to secure a stay in the Premiership for next season. Tottenham on the other hand have been enjoying a good run of play as of late, and had a chance to jump above Portsmouth into 8th position in the Premiership. West Ham started strongly in the match, desperately trying to bring the game to Tottenham with the support of their home fans urging them on. West Ham's first effort came in the second minute, but keeper Paul Robinson was able to beat away the shot of Mark Noble. Things took a downturn for the Hammers several minutes later, when Matthew Upson was forced off the pitch after aggravating a calf injury, and was replaced by Calum Davenport. Dimitar Berbatov then had two great chances for Tottenham, as he went one on one with keeper Robert Green, but Green was able to stop the Bulgarians attempts both times. West Ham continued to press, and were rewarded with a goal on 16 minutes. Paul Konchesky's pass was chested down by Argentinian Carlos Tevez, and Mark Noble half-volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham nearly got an equilizer only minutes later after a defensive error by West Ham, but Berbatov's shot was again saved by Green. More chances came for both sides in the forms of Defoe for Tottenham and Harewood for West Ham, but the next goal would come through the young Carlos Tevez. Michael Dawson fouled the Argintinian on the outside of the 18 yard box, and Tevez curved the ensuing free kick in under the crossbar. The goal was Teves' first since joining West Ham at the beginning of the season. He was booked for his goal celebration as he ripped off his shirt and ran into a group of cheering fans. Tottenham made a change to start the second half, substituting Tom Huddlestone for Hossam Ghaly, and Huddlestones prescence helped Tottenham to control the midfield. They used their control to its potential, and Aaron Lennon was able to earn a penalty after being brought down by Lee Bowyer in the area. Jermain Defoe stepped up and slotted the ball past Green to cut the Hammers lead in half. Spurs continued to press for an equilizer, and got it in the 63 minute as Lennon flicked a Berbatov cross into the path of Tainio, and the Finnish international volleyed the ball past Green. The tying goal seemed to wake West Ham up, and Bobby Zamora and Keppa Blanco were added to the mix to try and save the 3 points for the home side. West Ham got their goal, and Tevez was involved again as his cross was headed home by substitute Zamora. As 90 minutes approached, Tottenham won a free kick on the edge of the box, and Dimitar Berbatov stepped up to the plate. Several of Berbatov's attempts had been blocked by keeper Green already, but he would not be denied this time as he curled the ball into the top left corner, leaving the goalie helpless. Tevez again threatened Tottenhams goal, but his shot flew just wide. West Ham would be left to rue their missed chances when Defoe's shot was parried by Green, but the ball was tapped in by Canadian Paul Stalteri, giving the visitors their first lead of the game, and soon earning them all 3 points. The goal came just over 5 minutes into stoppage time, and there was no chance left for West Ham to equilize. West Ham will continue their battle to stay in the Premiership in two weeks time against Blackburn, while Tottenham is due for an UEFA cup battle against Braga."

sport,"Arsenal FC bookings_away = Denilson, Eboue, Fabregas (Yellow (3)), Toure, Adebayor (Red(2)) A heated showdown occurred in the all London Carling Cup final yesterday at Millennium Stadium. Chelsea fielded a full strength side, including Andriy Shevchenko, Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, and skipper John Terry. Arsenal on the other hand fielded a young side, including Theo Walcott, Cesc Fabregas, Jeremie Aliadiere, and Justin Hoyte. Despite their apparent lack of experience, Arsenal started out the match strongly, with crisp passing and great control. They pressed their advantage, and forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into several saves. On 12 minutes, Theo Walcott struck gold, as he orcestrated a give and go with Abou Diaby and slotted the ball into the far corner of the net, scoring his first ever goal for the Gunners. Soon after, Baptista of Arsenal had a legitimate claim for a penalty, but referee Howard Webb wouldn't hear of it. Chelsea struck back quickly, and a hint of offside was shown as Didier Drogba was played in by an over the top ball by Michael Ballack. The Ivory Coast striker didn't wait for a whistle, and slotted the ball between Manuel Almunia's legs to tie the match. A few more chances were spurned due to poor finishing before the break, but the game went into halftime drawn at one a piece. The second half started much as the first, with the youthful exuberance of Arsenal showing through, as they continued to press. Chelsea's output was increased as well however, with the addition of Arjen Robben at the exspense of Makelele. 2 yellow cards were handed out to Chelsea in the next few minutes, before the game took a huge downturn. Chelsea skipper John Terry was seriously injured, when Diaby's foot connected squarly with his face as Diaby attempted to clear the ball. Terry was taken off in a stretcher and was replaced by Mikel. The loss of their captain seemed to push Chelsea to new levels, as Drogba forced a fine save out of Almunia, and Lampard saw his shot go off the woodwork. Arsenal were not able to hold on, and on 81 minutes, Denilson made a sloppy pass and Robben picked up the scraps. He sent a cross in as Drogba beat Senderos to the ball and headed in his 28th of the campaign. The blue tide continued, and Shevchenko blasted a ball off the woodwork, missing his chance to seal the victory. As the game entered stoppage time, Mikel and Toure entered a shoving match, and more players got involved. Coaches took the field to attempt to settle their players, and when all was finally calm, Mikel and Toure were shown red cards, along with Adebayor of Arsenal. The game was finally called at 101 minutes, and stand in skipper Lampard was able to hoist the Carling Cup."

sport,"Accused of EPO doping by the French cycling daily L'Équipe in a four page story on Aug. 23, cyclist Lance Armstrong appeared on CNN's Larry King Live TV show Aug. 25, saying he did not trust the French testers or the French testing system, and that his urine was manipulated to falsely accuse him of doping. Dr. Christiane Ayotte, director of a Montreal doping detection laboratory said that ethically critical and important scientific questions were raised by the EPO doping allegation against seven-time Tour de France winner Armstrong. USA Cycling official Gerard Bisceglia said these L'Équipe charges were unfair and lacked credibility. Bisceglia is chief executive of USA Cycling, principal authority over Armstrong for cycling sports in the United States. L'Équipe released Paris lab data allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France. No official source would confirm medical identification of Armstrong as provider of the anonymously tested urine, and to do so would be a violation of World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) regulations. Armstrong suggested motivation for such manipulation is a French national hatred of all non-French sport winners, and specifically because a French rider has not won the Tour de France for a quarter century. As evidence of malice toward him, Armstrong cited a French newspaper poll in which he was named the third most hated sportsman in France. Dr. Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique in Montreal, which is a WADA certified lab nearest to WADA's Montreal headquarters. Ayotte is also a world class scientific authority and instructor on sports doping detection. Dr. Ayotte's expert opinion has significant influence on the outcome of WADA regulatory decisions. L'Équipe reported that the EPO detection method used was experimental, which raises a scientific question. All experimentally based forensic evidence is subject to the close scrutiny of scientific opinions before it can be used in a disciplinary or legal proceeding. Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations, that previously detectable EPO protein deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte thinks that a new statistical mathematics model was used to reanalyze numerical data resulting from earlier chemical testing. ""My interpretation is that retesting itself must have been conducted in 2000 or in 2001, but the results were reviewed using the new mathematical model that is now being developed in Paris."" Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. The first ethical problem is that this adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples. There are normally available two urine samples, ""A"" and ""B"". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's ""B"" samples. Armstrong's ""A"" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. Without addressing the ethics problem, Dick Pound, the head of WADA, said. ""You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a ""B"" sample has not confirmed the result of the ""A"" sample"". Both France and USA officials observed that L'Équipe's unofficial adverse finding was not consistent with WADA regulations. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the ""A"" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. USA official Bisceglia confirmed that WADA regulations require a confirming ""A"" test to prove guilt. The second ethical problem, according to Ayotte, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event, has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. This same ethical problem was also stated by USA official Bisceglia. The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that L'Équipe disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. ""It seems to me,"" Ayotte continued, ""that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements."" In a further ethical complication, the medical identification of Armstrong is completely unofficial and is made only by L'Équipe. Ayotte characterized the disclosure as ""leaked"". Châtenay-Malabry's lab refused to confirm L'Équipe's claim that the urine samples belonged to Armstrong. Nor is it likely that Châtenay-Malabry will ever identify Armstrong, because WADA regulations require that all single ""B"" samples used for experimental testing must remain permanently anonymous. Ayotte said, ""I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind."" Lance Armstrong has responded on his LanceArmstrong.com website, branding L'Équipe's reporting as being ""nothing short of tabloid journalism."" Armstrong says: ""I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."" Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, It's Not About the Bike: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. ""It was the only thing that kept me alive,"" he wrote. Armstrong last received chemotherapy EPO in late 1996. Apparently speaking from his knowledge of conventional EPO testing, Armstrong agrees that traces of 1996 synthetic EPO should not have been present in his 1999 urine. There are now tests to distinguish natural from synthetic EPO. But it remains an unresearched scientific question whether the sensitivity of the experimental new method could detect use of synthetic EPO from three years previously. By scientific analogy, the polymerase chain reaction process can detect as little as a single molecule of DNA. Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Armstrong subsequently provided an explanation claiming urine test manipulation. Leblanc also said; ""For the first time&amp;mdash;and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts&amp;mdash;someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body."" ""When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a pretty strong statement to make,"" said Bisceglia, ""when the person you're making it about has never been given the opportunity to refute the statement. You're making claims about something that took place in 1999. Based on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity to have a black-and-white resolution to this case has been destroyed."" Bisceglia said that USA Cycling, the governing body in the United States, lacks the officially required evidence, and therefore will not investigate the L'Équipe report."
sport,"-unreviewed A brief look around major league baseball. . . Philadelphia 8, Tampa Bay 5 The Philadelphia Phillies snapped a five game losing streak, defeating Tampa Bay 8-5 between a Father's Day crowd of 42,658 earlier today at Citizens' Bank Park in Philadelphia. Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard homered and knocked in four runs, and Phils' closer Tom Gordon, in a game for the first time in over a week, pitched 1 2/3 shaky innings for his 19th save. The Phillies are 15-5 in games in which Howard hits the long ball. Tampa OF Carl Crawford was 2 for 5 with a homer and 2 RBI for the losing Rays. With the Phillies getting farther away from the Mets in the NL East, the Phils are likely to start concentrating on the NL wild card race if not now, very soon. Washington 3, N.Y. Yankees 2 Further south, Washington Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman hit a walk off 2 run shot in the bottom of the 9th to lift Washington over the visiting New York Yankees, 3-2. Zimmerman, whose hitting has gotten hotter with the temperatures, hit the game winner off of Yankees losing pitcher Chien - Ming Wang spoiling his major league debut Oakland 5, L.A. Dodgers 3 Oakland right-hander Joe Blanton, pitching into the ninth inning, helped the streaking Oakland A's to their tenth straight win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2 earlier today. Blanton gave way to Oakland reliever Huston Street, who pitched an inning for his 17th save. Oakland center-fielder Jay Payton and infielder Marco Scutaro each had three hits for the A's, who edged into first place in the AL west over Texas. Detroit 12, Chicago Cubs 3 Chicago's Mark Prior made his season debut after a series of injuries that left him sidelined. The Detroit Tigers gave him a rude welcome, as they knotched 6 runs in the first inning on 3 homers. Jose Guillen had a 3-run homer in the first inning to contribute to the Tigers route. Prior didn't last 4 inning and gave up 7 earned runs. The Cubs lost their 6th in a row and are only one game ahead of the cellar Pirates. Detroit sweeps the Cubs and now holds a 1.5 game lead over Chicago's American League team, the White Sox."

sport,"Donperfectodewiki The International Olympic Committee (IOC) Evaluation Commission is in Madrid, Spain this week as part of the city's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Sir Craig Reedie of Great Britain is leading the IOC delegation, whom Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy greeted at the start of their inspection process. Of the fourteen-member bid delegation, five have been through this process before as part of the city's failed bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics bids. On a cold but sunny day yesterday, the IOC visited four sites on their first inspection date including Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Buen Retiro park and bullfighting ring Las Ventas. Today, the IOC is scheduled to visit the proposed venues for the Olympic village and stadium. The inspection is scheduled to last four days. While at Santiago Bernabéu, IOC members met the Spanish national football team captain Iker Casillas and were given Real Madrid jerseys with their names on them. As Spain is currently undergoing severe economic problems at the moment, with 26% unemployment currently and public debt in 2012 at 84% of the country's gross domestic product, the €1.5bn (US$1.9bn, £1.3bn) costs of the Games have been a highly visible aspect of the city's bid process. Security costs are estimated to add another €149m (US$192m, £127m) to organizing costs. Proponents of the bid including Madrid's mayor Ana Botella believe the Games would provide an economic boost to the city and the country. IOC President Jacques Rogge is also on the record as stating that he does not believe Spanish economic problems will play a part in the IOC's decision-making process. Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted Rogge saying, ""The crisis does not affect it, because substantial facilities have in most cases already been built. No major investment is needed"". Botella outlined some of the costs, quoted by the Associated Press during the IOC visit saying, ""The budget that remains for the construction of infrastructure, some 1.5 billion euros divided between the three administrations responsible and over a period of seven years, is a perfectly affordable amount."" Local organizers have promised to follow the legacy of London, using historical landmarks and existing venues with 80% of proposed venues, 28 of 35, already in place, and providing a roadmap for future development of Olympic sites to avoid any ""white elephants"" that are unused after the Games, a situation that happened with a number of Athens Olympic venues. Madrid's bid Chief Executive Victor Sánchez, quoted by Agence France-Presse, explained they avoided ""projects that have no real use for citizens after the Games have finished. That is why we have given priority to existing infrastructures and then to other infrastructures that the city has a direct need for. Finally, where a future use cannot be guaranteed, we have opted for temporary solutions. Only three such temporary solutions will be used, while a mere four permanent facilities remain to be built. The result is lower costs, reduced environmental impact and less disruption to the everyday lives of the people of Madrid, all with government backing at central, regional and municipal level."" Local organizers are preparing to cope with protesters trying to draw attention to Spain's labor situation who planned to picket outside the Hotel Eurostars Madrid Tower where IOC members are staying. The planned protest is over cuts to the Municipal Government budget. Protesters did not picket yesterday, which was a holiday in Madrid. Bid organizers and the government feared potential strikes by people working for the public transport system. Botella explained to the media that protests and work stoppages should not be seen as evidence that Spaniards would not welcome the Games, but rather unhappiness with local economic issues, which Botella said the Games should help fix. Spain's current unemployment level is the highest of any European country and the worst the country has faced since the 1970s. Botella's view is supported by an IOC survey, which found 81% of Spaniards supported Madrid's bid for the Games. Madrid is one of three cities currently competing for the 2020 Games. The IOC visited Tokyo, Japan earlier this month and is scheduled to visit Istanbul, Turkey later this month. The host city is to be formally selected at a meeting of the IOC on September 7 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Shortly after that, Rogge is scheduled to step down from his position as IOC President."

""There are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement. I kind of just want to see my mom."" ""Without the help of my team-mates this isn't possible,"" he continued. ""I was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit. For the three Olympics I've been a part of, this is by far the closest men's team that we've ever had. I didn't know everybody coming into this Olympics, but I feel going out I know every single person very well. The team that we had is the difference."" Grant Hackett, an Australian swimmer, praised Phelps for achieving his goal.

sport,"UKResidents of a Leeds, England neighbourhood have requested help from a council because their neighbourhood is plagued by crime, overcrowding, and community tensions. Leeds City Council received a request for help from residents of Hyde Park, who said they were worried about the increasing level of anti-social behavior and worsening community relations. A report will be unveiled on Wednesday by a council delegation, highlighting the problems in the area. ""The people living in Hyde Park come from widely different population groups... these groups have very different customs, needs and living styles and this can provoke high levels of tension in the area,"" the delegation said. The council claims that because of the 28 per cent ethnic minority population and the 40,000 students living in the neighbourhood, there are tensions between residents. They added, however, that they are actively encouraging people to work together, citing a multi-faith forum, a cricket competition and activities which bring old and young together. The report says that the council are trying to build relationships between Muslims and police, something which they said is ""particularly important after the area's connection to the London bombings on 7th July 2005."" A local newspaper reported that ""the Shebab project introduces young Muslims to role models from sport and culture and also runs scholars' talks to counter extremist ideologies."" Crime has increased by 7% in the past year in Hyde Park, and residents noted that anti-social behaviour was getting worse. The council said that an anti-burglary task force had helped to reduce the number of thefts from homes. Residents complained that there was a lack of pride in the area, and at the end of the academic year in the summer, large piles of rubbish were left in streets, yards and alleyways. The report adds that the council operates a recycling scheme aimed towards teenagers, and that rubbish collections have increased. 4=Jake England Johns, campaigner The Guardian reported on Wednesday that campaigners are attempting to ""take control of a derelict school building and transform it into a community hub are appealing for sponsors and partners in a bid to turn their dreams into reality."" They say that the unused building, owned by the council, could be used for meetings and events. A volunteer group of residents have been working on a business plan, and have gained support from local businesses to create ""a vision of an open, accessible and valuable resource for all."" A member of the commitee, however, said he was ""frustrated"" with the council's attitude towards the plans. ""The RPCC is slightly frustrated with certain communication issues that we've had with the council, but we're working with them and hoping to gain further assistance going forward,"" he said. ""It's a shame that certain setbacks could have been avoided."" The deputation added that ""a major factor in Hyde Park's suffering is its high level of population density"", which they conceded is something they are unable to change. The council responded to complaints that streets are ""cheap and unhealthy takeaways, letting agents and boarded-up shop fronts,"" by saying that Hyde Park Corner and Headingley are, according to the Yorkshire Post, ""thriving shopping areas and work had taken place to ensure a good mix of outlets."" The report concludes: ""The council acknowledges that because of the very particular circumstances which exist in the neighbourhood, Hyde Park faces difficult challenges which affect the quality of life of residents and that 'normal' service levels may not be sufficient to tackle some of these. The council will do more to enable local people to influence how services work and how local problems are tackled. Local community and voluntary groups will be invited to play an active role."""

In the last six World Cup tournaments, Mexico has never lost their first game, winning five of those. It was the first defeat for Germany since losing to France in the UEFA Euro 2016's semi-finals. After the match, Germany's coach Joachim Löw said ""In the first half, we played very badly. We were not able to impose our usual way of playing, attacking, and there were lots of counter-attacks against us and we were very vulnerable. In the second half, we were able to press more, but Mexico drew back and then carried the ball forward fast. We had a couple of shots, but it seemed jinxed and the ball did not go into the goal. Everybody is really unhappy and crestfallen but we have to put this behind us. Our team has experience of losses."" In the last match on the day, Brazil faced Switzerland at Rostov-on-Don. Brazil had greater ball possession and more attempts. In the 11th minute, Paulinho missed just in front of the goal to put Brazil in the lead. However, Brazil got a 1&amp;ndash;0 lead in the 20th minute when Philippe Coutinho scored from outside the box. Switzerland's Stephan Lichtsteiner was the only one to be booked in the first half as it ended 1&amp;ndash;0 with Brazil leading. Two minutes into the second half, Casemiro was shown the yellow card for a bad foul. Switzerland won a corner in the 50th minute. Steven Zuber scored a header from Xherdan Shaqiri and equalised for the Swiss side. Multiple attempts by Neymar, Thiago Silva, Casemiro, and Coutinho came through, but none succeeded. The match ended 1&amp;ndash;1 as both countries won one point. Valon Behrami became the first Switzerland player to feature in four different World Cups. After the match, Brazil's coach Tite said, ""We had too many balls off target, if we had been a bit more focused we could have made the goalkeeper work a bit more. My expectation of course was to get a victory and of course I'm not happy with the result."" Coutinho won the Budweiser Man of the Match award. clear"
sport,"Sevilla FC bookings_away = None English club Tottenham Hotspur dropped out of the UEFA Cup after a 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane against Spanish side Sevilla. Spurs lost the first game 2-1 in Spain, and the tie was enough to see Sevilla through 4-3 on aggregate. Sevilla had a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes in London. Steed Malbranque scored an own goal after 3 minutes as he attempted to clear the ball off the line. The ball scuffed off the bottom of his boot and bobbled into the net. Former Tottenham player Freddie Kanoute then doubled the visitors lead only minutes later after he collected the ball, played a one two, and danced around keeper Paul Robinson. Before the end of the first half, Dimitar Berbatov struck the post off a hammered shot, but the score remained 2-0. Tottenham struck back in the second half and substitute Jermain Defoe scored minutes after coming on to cut Sevilla's lead. Just a minute later, Aaron Lennon tied the game, putting pressure on Sevilla. Two more chances emerged for Tottenham, one through defender Michael Dawson and Dimitar Berbatov, but neither where able to convert. With only stoppage time remaining, and Spurs in need of two goals to advance, frustration played out as Teemu Tainio was red carded for a dangerous challenge on Puerta. Sevilla was one of three Spanish sides to advance to the semi-finals Thursday, and they will face Osasuna in the next round, guaranteeing there will be a Spanish club in the final. Tottenham have only the Premiership left to contend for now, as they look to book a European spot for next season against Wigan Athletic on the 15th."

sport,"Thirteen world records were broken by disability swimmers at this week's Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide, which also acts as the national selection trials for the forthcoming London Olympics and Paralympics. Seven of the records were in freestyle events, three in breaststroke, two in butterfly, and one in backstroke. The week also marked a changing of the guard in Australian swimming, with a handful of Olympic champions coming out of retirement, but with the exception of Libby Trickett, failing to qualify. Five swimmers set seven freestyle world records between them. Matthew Cowdrey broke the S9 50m and 100m records, with times of 25.66s and 55.20s respectively. In the 100m he was beaten by Daniel Fox who set a record in the S14 class with a time of 54.38s. The 50m race also saw a second record fall, with Mitchell Kilduff setting the new mark of 24.84s in the S14 class. Brenden Hall now holds the S9 400m record, with a winning time of 4:14.67. Jacqui Freney won the women's 100m in a time of 68.03s, an S8 record. Kayla Clarke took the 50m event in 28.66s, an S14 record. In the other strokes, three swimmers set six world records between them. Blake Cochrane dominated the men's breaststroke, winning both the 50m and 100m, and setting records for his S8 class of 36.73s, and 79.06s. Tim Antalfy set S13 records in two disciplines, winning the 50m backstroke in 28.20s, then twice breaking the 100m butterfly record (55.31s in the preliminaries then 54.92s in the final), beating his nearest competitor by over six seconds. Prue Watt capped the record breaking run on the final night of competition, setting the women's S13 50m breaststroke mark at 36.27s. For national championships, disabled events are combined into ""multi class"" races which include competitors with a range of disabilities. They compete according to a point scoring system, with their performance measured against the world record for their classification. Thus not only have these swimmers qualified for London and written their names into the record books, they have also raised the bar for themselves in future competitions. In the able-bodied championships, all eyes were on the ex-champions attempting to return to the top level from retirement. Ian Thorpe, Michael Klim, and Geoff Huegill all missed qualification. Responding to their disappointments: Thorpe intends to continue swimming; Klim announced his retirement; and Huegill will discuss his options with his family. Libby Trickett scraped into the 4x100m relay team, placing fifth in the women's 100m final. A new generation will take national titles with them to their first Olympic competition. James Magnussen will be a serious contender in two individual and two relay events, after winning both the 50m and 100m freestyle. David McKeon won the 400m and 800m freestyle. Thomas Fraser-Holmes took the 200m freestyle and 400m individual medley, and Daniel Tranter took the 200m medley. Mitch Larkin secured the 200m backstroke title. Chris Wright won the 50m and 100m butterfly. Nick D'Arcy, winner of the 200m butterfly, now has a chance at Olympic redemption. He was originally selected for Beijing, but was kicked off the team for assaulting a fellow team-member. Three women have also booked their Olympic debut wearing the mantle of national champion. Alice Tait won the 50m butterfly title. Tessa Wallace won the women's 200m breaststroke, relegating Leisel Jones, a former world record holder and world champion in the event, to fourth. Leiston Pickett edged out Jones to take the 100m breaststroke title. Many of Australia's top performers from the Beijing Olympics have secured a place on the team heading to London. Among the women, Stephanie Rice, Jessicah Schipper, Alicia Coutts, Emily Seebohm, Kylie Palmer, Bronte Barratt, Cate Campbell, Melissa Gorman, Belinda Hocking, and Melanie Schlanger all booked their trip with wins this week. Although Jones missed out on Olympic selection in the 200m, second place in the 100m was enough to secure a berth to her fourth Olympic Games. In the men's events, Olympic silver medallists Brenton Rickard, Christian Sprenger, Hayden Stoeckel, Eamon Sullivan, and Matthew Targett will all get another shot at gold. Kenrick Monk missed out on the finals of the 200m freestyle in Beijing, but will contest the event again in London. Two national title winners did not qualify for the Olympics. Jarrod Poort won the men's 1500m freestyle, but finished outside the Olympic qualifying time. Benjamin Treffers won the mens 50m backstroke, which is not on the Olympic program. After the meet, Swimming Australia named the Olympic team. Along with those mentioned above, the men on the team are Daniel Arnamnart, Tommaso D'Orsogna, Jayden Hadler, Matson Lawson, Cameron McEvoy, Ned McKendry, Ryan Napoleon, and James Roberts. Completing the team for the women are Olympic newcomers Jessica Ashwood, Bronte Campbell (Cate's sister), Brittany Elmslie, Blair Evans, Samantha Hamill, Yolane Kukla, and Jade Neilsen, and veterans Angie Bainbridge, Sally Foster and Meagen Nay. The Paralympic team has not yet been announced. Alongside the record-setters, favourites for Games selection include disability class winners Ellie Cole, Michael Anderson, Grant Patterson, Taylor Corry, Esther Overton, Maddison Elliott, Katherine Downie, Matthew Levy, Rick Pendleton, Amanda Fowler, and Sarah Rose. Ahmed Kelly, abandoned as a baby with severe deformities in an Iraqi orphanage, and rescued by an Australian charity, qualified in the 50m breaststroke. The eight day meet was held during the period March 15-22 at the SA Aquatic and Leisure Centre, in Oakland's Park, South Australia. It was run by Swimming Australia, with Energy Australia as the principal sponsor."
sport,"referee= Roberto Rosetti Celtic headed into this match knowing a goal would send them into the group stages. Celtic started well when Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink shouldered Shunsuke Nakamura's cross over the bar after ten minutes. If the Dutchman had've been more precise Celtic could've controlled the game from the start. Five minutes later Scott McDonald played a one-two with Vennegoor of Hesselink who played a good short ball back which fell right for McDonald's left foot but he agonisingly hit wide. It wasn't all Celtic though. Spartak Moscow counter-attacked brilliantly and nearly scored 17 minuted in. Artur Boruc made a last-ditch save and Lee Naylor cleared after Vladimir Bystrov cut the ball back to Dmitri Torbinsky just outside the box. Just 60 seconds later Aiden McGeady hit a good shot wide of the Moscow goal. Then 25 minutes in, the referee made the worst decision of the match. Welliton, the Brazilian striker, shot straight at Artur Boruc and the ball bounced off him and hit Gary Caldwell's grounded hand. The referee gave the penalty. There was nowhere for Caldwell to go and the penalty should not have been given. However Pavlyuchenko's penalty hit the post. 2 minutes later Celtic showed no signs of giving up. Scott McDonald scored his first Celtic goal after Massimo Donati's shot deflected off a defender and fell for McDonald on his stronger right foot. He slotted it straight past the keeper to give Celtic a 1-0 lead. 35 minutes into the match, Bystrov, who'd been causing Celtic, mainly Lee Naylor, many problems, sprinted past Lee Naylor again and if it wasn't for captain Stephen McManus blocking the shot, it could've been 1-1. Just before half time Spartak scored from a corner after scrappy Celtic defending. Vennegoor of Hesselink and Mark Wilson couldn't clear the ball and Pavlyuchenko, who missed a penalty earlier, controlled and slotted the ball past a very angry Artur Boruc. In first half stoppage time, Bystrov powered down the left wing and Naylor gave away another corner, luckily though the referee blew his whistle. But that didn't stop Artur Boruc from going over to Lee Naylor and shouting at him. Lee Naylor hit back and if it wasn't for Caldwell and McGeady breaking it up they could've both been sent off. The second half started as lively as the first. Vennegoor of Hesselink was being held in the box in the 51st minute but no penalty was given. The next big chance was when the ball fell for Vennegoor of Hesselink in the 65th minute, he turned and dragged a point-blank shot wide. From the 77th minute onwards the game started to open up with McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink having two great chances before Nakamura had three chances in two minutes. In the 84th minute Nakamura had a chance to score a free-kick after Vennegoor of Hesselink was taken down by Martin Stranzl, 21 yards out from goal. Stranzl was then sent off by the referee and Spartak Moscow were left with ten men for the remainder of the match. Unfortunately Nakamura's free-kick hit McDonald as it made it's way toward the goal. Celtic and Spartak both had chances before the full time whistle went. Celtic were very attacking from the start of extra time. The man advantage seemed to be helping Celtic as McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink both missed good chances in the first five minutes. In the 99th minute Aiden McGeady made a good run down the right wing to find nobody in the box. Forced to make a shot, it ended it up going off for a throw in. Just before extra time half time Derek Riordan, who replaced McGeady, picked up the ball and slammed a brilliant shot just a yard wide on his European début. Five minutes into the second half of extra time, Maksym Kalynychenko hit a superb shot which Boruc got a vital touch to. The ball then went straight down to the Spartak box but Vennegoor of Hesselink could only hit into Stipe Pletikosa's hands. In the 24th minute, Celtic were gifted a penalty after Scott Brown's power shot struck Radoslav Kováč's arm. Vennegoor smashed the penalty into the bar. Six minutes later the referee blew the whistle. The match was going to penalties. Penalty takers Celtic 1) Caldwell 2) Nakamura 3) Vennegoor of Hesselink 4) Riordan 5) Zurawski Spartak Moscow 1) Mozart 2) Titov 3) Pavlyuchenko 4) Şoava 5) Kalynychenko Caldwell scored his penalty and Mozart equalised. Nakamura smashed his penalty against the bar but Boruc saved Titov's. Vennegoor of Hesselink scored his penalty this time round and so too did Pavlyuchenko. Riordan scored the perfect penalty and Şoava scored his. Zurawski knocked his home and Kalynychenko had his saved by Boruc. Man of the Match Artur Boruc"
sport,"The Detroit Tigers began their 2005 season in style on April 4, defeating the Kansas City Royals 11-2 in their home opener of the Major League Baseball season. The game, played in front of a record crowd of 44,105 at Detroit's Comerica Park, was an offensive showcase for the Tigers, led by Dmitri Young, who went 4-for-4, matching a career-high 5 RBIs. Three of Young's four hits were home runs, making Young only the third baseball player in history to hit three home runs in a season opener. The previous two players to accomplish that feat are George Bell, who hit three home runs for the Toronto Blue Jays against the Royals on opening day, 1988; and Tuffy Rhodes, who hit three home runs for the Chicago Cubs against the New York Mets in 1994. Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman was the winning pitcher, the youngest starter to win an opening day game since 1986. * WP: Jeremy Bonderman (1-0) * LP: Jose Lima (0-1)"
sport,"AS Roma bookings_away = Perrotta, Pizarro (Yellow (2)) A full crowd showed up at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon earlier today, only to watch their home side fall to Roma of Italy. The previous leg in the series saw the two teams draw 0-0 which gave Roma a slight advantage from the start, as a draw would allow them to advance. The previous match was extremely undisciplined, and Roma was given eight yellow cards. The Italian side showed a much calmer demeanor this game, earning only two yellows in comparison to Lyon's four. Lyon produced the first chance of the game as Romas keeper Alexandre Doni was unable to cope with Juninho, but defender Philippe Mexes was able to clear the ball from nearby strikers. Roma had their own chance soon after, as Daniele De Rossi was left open, and he headed the ball home. The goal was disallowed by the referee after he spotted a push by De Rossi on Eric Abidal. Juninho continued to threaten Roma, but his crosses were not able to do any damage to the Rossinari. Lyon fell behind on 22 minutes when Max Tonetto clipped a cross into the middle, and Francesco Totti was in the right place to head the ball past Gregory Coupet. Crosses continued to be the only attack Lyon could muster, and they produced a good chance off a Juninho corner kick. The ball ricoched off several players before Squillaci latch on for a shot, but the ball was sent directly at Doni, and the keeper made the save. Mancini then doubled the visitors lead just before halftime. After some quick stepovers to fool Anthony Reveillere, he struck the ball soundly into the top corner of the net. After the break, Roma could have killed off the game indefinitely, as Tadei beat Lyon's offside trap, but was unable to regain the composure required to smash the ball home. Doni then produced a few saves for Roma, kicking out Sylvan Wiltord's shot, and then diving to palm away a curling shot by Juninho. Both teams then made vain attempts for a penalty, but both Fred and Perrotta diving, but the referee made the right decisions and awarded only a yellow to Perrotta. Fred was then given a yellow for cruelly smashing Chivu in the face with his arm. Fred was lucky to receive a red for his actions. Roma held on for the win, and the 5 time french champions bowed out of the Champions League."

sport,"sports Wikinews caught up with Australian wheelchair basketball coach David Gould in Canberra, where the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team &amp;mdash; the Gliders &amp;mdash; were having a training camp. Gould told Wikinews he retired from playing after the 2002 World Championships. He said he began coaching able bodied basketball at schools and clubs in South Australia. He was awarded a scholarship by Basketball Australia and the Australian Sports Commission, and became assistant coach of the Under 23 Men's team in November 2011. He is now national wheelchair skills coach, assistant coach of the men's and women's national teams, and coach of the Under 23 Men's and Under 25 Women's teams. He noted the Gliders have another training camp coming up in Brisbane in August. This is to be an open development camp any player can attend. Twelve players are to be selected for the Asia Oceania Zone (AOZ) Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Bangkok in November. The top three teams then qualify for the World Championships, to be held in Canada next year. He is acutely aware the Gliders have never won a World Championship or a Paralympics. But he has won a gold medal, with the men's team, the Rollers, in Atlanta in 1996. ""We went on a tour of the United States beforehand"", he recalled. Facing the United States in the United States was daunting. There was a huge crowd. So how did they do it? ""We had confidence in ourselves, and stuck to our plan,"" he recalled. This, he said, is what he and Glider's head coach Tom Kyle are trying to teach the Gliders. To believe in the process. They take them out of their comfort zone, show them the right techniques, the right way to do things. The idea is to get the principles right. Gould told Wikinews they have to look not just to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio in 2016, but further ahead to 2020. They have to recruit new players and develop them. He said he took a Gliders team to the Osaka Cup with only four members of the 2012 team, in order to give members of the development team experience with international competition. He set up a mentor system whereby the six newcomers were each paired with one of the old hands. Wikinews was shown how the games are videoed and critiqued by the coaches. Special software allows the videos to be edited. Effects such as circling players can be added, along with captions and audio from the coaches. The edited video can then be downloaded by the players. Gould said there is a weekly video conference with the players. He considered video of other teams is an important training tool. He noted the Gliders had to play Brazil in the first match of the Paralympics in London, which was very tough, because so little was known about them. As it turned out, Brazil has a great program, and he thinks it could be a contender in front of a home crowd in Rio in 2016. Wikinews noted one of the Gliders, Amber Merritt, had her arm in a sling. Gould said her arm had been scanned, and the doctors will make their evaluation. Like most elite athletes, he knows about injury first hand. He told Wikinews he had injured his shoulder during the 2000 Olympics, and had to have it operated on afterwards. He said he did not want players playing injured, and sometimes it was better just to lose a week if you have the flu. He expected his players to be honest and up front with themselves, their coaches and their team. ""We need everyone on the same page"", he told Wikinews. Gould told Wikinews the Asia Oceania Zone championships will feature Australia, Japan, China, Thailand, South Korea, and perhaps Hong Kong. The venue in Bangkok is well known to him, as the U23 Men's team have already played there. His plan is to arrive early, to allow the players to acclimatise to the high humidity and the food. Some of the U23 men got sick. He does not expect difficulty qualifying, but it is ""one of the I's that have to be dotted and T's that have to be crossed."" He said Australians intend to apply full pressure, but one of their objectives is also to help the competition. One of the problems in Australia is that it takes a long time to go anywhere, he told Wikinews. By building up the teams in the Asia Oceania Zone, he hopes Australian teams will not have to travel so much or so far to meet first class competition."

sport,"The 20th Olympic Winter Games are set to start today in Turin, Italy. Producers of the Olympics have promised, ""rhythm, passion and speed,"" as an estimated 35,000 people will pile inside the stadium and nearly two billion will turn out for the events. Dancers, abutting the majestic Alps, paid a tribute to seven nations, including Austria, Germany and France, in the opening ceremonies wearing green sheaths and pulling fake cows on wheels. It was to pay homage to livestock and mountain life, and so the audience could cheer both, everyone was supplied with cowbells. Dancers then brought out big white bubbles which were stuck to their heads. Bacilli, who has performed in concerts for U2 and The Rolling Stones said the balls signify snow. Eight women, Italian actress Sophia Loren, Chilean writer Isabel Allende, American actress Susan Sarandon, Nobel Peace-prize winner Wangari Maathai of Kenya, and three Olympic medal winners carried the Olympic flag. This was the first time ever that only women carried the flag. At least 6,100 volunteers who worked an estimated 10,000 hours helped to organize and run the ceremonies. Unfortunately, in the hours before the games were to start, eight cross-country skiers, a former gold medalist from Germany, and two Americans, were suspended for five days each after they failed blood tests. The tests say that they had elevated levels of hemoglobin, an enzyme within red blood cells that can increase endurance. However, the positives results could be due to the body's acclimation to mountain air, or dehydration. The American skiers are Kikkan Randall of Anchorage Alaska, and Leif Zimmermann of Bozeman, Montana."
sport,"Tottenham Hotspur bookings_away = Ghaly, Zokora, Lee, Stalteri, Cerny (Yellow (5)) Premiership title hopefuls Chelsea were forced to battle back for a draw earlier today at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham seemed to have a spot in the semifinals of the FA Cup all wrapped up before two late strikes from Lampard and Kalou ruined the day for Spurs. Chelsea were again without the heart of their defence, John Terry, and it showed for much of the game as Tottenham broke through the Blues lines far too easily on several occasions. Chelsea came out to win though, and nearly all their main stars were on the pitch to start the match, including Shevchenko, Ballack, Drogba, and Lampard. Martin Jol's Tottenham also fielded a strong attacking side, even without the use of the injured Robbie Keane. Defoe, Berbatov, and Lennon lead the way for Spurs instead, with Canadian Paul Stalteri and Englishman Michael Dawson on defence. Tottenham also had to use their backup keeper Radek Cerny, as their number one Paul Robinson is with Keane on the injured list. Tottenham came out fast and hard, scoring after only 5 minutes. Jermain Defoe cut in from the left and attempted a pass to Hossam Ghaly, but Aaron Lennon pick up the ball instead and sent it in to the Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov. Chelsea keeper Petr Cech sprinted out in an attempt to block, but Berbatov spun and volleyed the ball high into the back of the net, giving the visitors the early lead. Tottenham pressed for a second, and two chances presented themselves to Defoe and Lennon, but the crossesfrom Berbatov and Defoe were out of the players reaches. Chelsea would strike back though, and the goal would be against the run of play. Ballack received a chested down ball from Shevchenko after a Drogba cross, and the German blasted the ball low and hard. The shot was off target, but Frank Lampard was able to react quickly enough to fling out his leg and deflect the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham continued to run at the shaky Chelsea defence, and were rewarded with a goal when Aaron Lennons seemingly harmless cross was knock into Chelsea's net by Michael Essien, who was attempting to cover back on defence. Tottenham then nearly gave Chelsea an own goal of their own as Michael Dawson knocked Arjen Robbens cross toward his own net, but Paul Stalteri raced back to clear off the line. After the near tying goal, Jose Mourinho made an early change by replacing Paulo Ferreira with Shaun Wright-Phillips. Another defensive error would see Chelsea two behind soon after though, as Ghaly beat three defenders to a high ball, and slotted the ball past Cech from 12 yards out. Chelsea had a few more chances as they tried to grab a lifeline before the break, but nothing truly troubled keeper Cerny. Chelsea came out of the dressing room much more positively after the break, and had 3 chances to score from 2 Ballack free kicks, and a well taken shot by Lampard. Cerny did well to keep the game at 3-1 however. Spurs nearly put the game away on the counter attack, but Cech came out quick to stop Aaron Lennons run, and Defoe could not find the net after the ensuing cross by Ghaly. Chelsea then made 2 changes in just over 5 minutes, as Boulahrouz and Kalou took to the pitch. On the 70th minute, Chelsea earned a corner, and Arjen Robben stepped up to take the set piece. A goulmouth scramble occurred from the curving corner and the ball landed nicely at Lampard's feet. The Enlgishman blasted it home, cutting the deficit to one. Chelsea equliazed 4 minutes from time through substitute Salomon Kalou. Didier Drogba headed the ball to his fellow countryman Kalou, and the Ivorian volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Jermain Defoe had a chance to be the hero for Tottenham only minutes later as he beat out three defenders and struck the ball hard past Cech, but not past the crossbar. The game ended drawn, and the replay will be held at White Hart Lane on March 19th."

sport,"On March 19, 2006, Candace Parker, the 6 foot, 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall Tennessee Lady Volunteers forward, made NCAA Basketball history and set a record as the first woman ever to double dunk in an NCAA game. The media buzz is that Parker has taken women's basketball up to a new level... the air. During a Women's NCAA Championship game against the Army Black Knights, Parker made her first dunk of the game with 13:44 left in the first half. The Lady Vols were ahead, 14-13, as Sidney Spencer fed the ball to Parker, who flew over opponents to the net, becoming the first woman to slam dunk in an NCAA game. The crowd roared... not once, but twice. With 14:18 left in the second half, Parker took Nicky Anosike's pass and soared above Army and Lady Vol players. Parker palmed the ball and stuffed it through the rim for her second slam dunk in the game. Even the famously focused Coach Pat Summit took a moment to appreciate the feat. During an NPR interview, sports analyst, Nancy Lieberman, spoke about what Parker's dunking foreshadows for women's basketball. Both Lieberman and Summit noted that Parker frequently dunks the ball during practice, as other women do. Lieberman says that women's basketball has developed immensely in recent years. And she expects audiences will see women NCAA and professional basketball players use dunking and other spectacular skills much more in the future. Most people are celebrating Parker's double dunk as a success. In both women's and men's basketball, a few have questioned whether dunking makes the game better. But, adding a dunk shot will certainly change the game, as will the continued development of point guards. Basketball analysts usually agree that dunking is exciting and most say that using this high-percentage shot will draw bigger audiences to women's hoops."
sport,"AustraliaAbout 50 cyclists have been involved in a hit-and-run attack by a car in the suburb of Mascot, just south of the centre of Sydney, Australia. The cyclists, including former Australian Olympian Ben Kersten, and road racer Kate Nichols, were in a group of cyclists hit when a driver who had been ""worrying"" the rear of the pack, overtook the cyclists, pulled in front of the pack, and then slammed on the brakes. The riders suffered a collection of minor scrapes and bruises, but no deaths were caused. The incident, which has been reported to have caused approximately A$30,000 worth of property damage to the cyclist's vehicles, also caused a semi-trailer to jack-knife, and cars to swerve. Although the cyclists had been following Australian road rules, the National Roads and Motorists' Association's senior adviser, Anne Morphett, said a large bike pack can sometimes stretch to 40 metres. ""They need to break them up so cars can overtake safely. You might have three across and five deep, but not 40 or 50 deep,"" she said. ""We want to see people get their training in but they need to be in areas that are safe - and these are public roads, not a training facility."" Kate Nichols, one of the injured, was also seriously injured in a crash in Germany in 2005 involving the Australian women's road cycling team that killed Australian cyclist Amy Gillett. The driver, a 34 year old man from Claymore, has been spoken to, but has yet to be charged."

sport,"United States sportsman Lance Armstrong today won the international cycling competition Tour de France. This is the seventh consecutive win for Armstrong. It is also his last, as Armstrong announced prior to the race that he will be retiring from professional cycling after the competition. The last leg was an 89.8-mile strecth from Corbeil-Essonnes to Paris' famed Champs-Elysees. But poor weather conditions affected the finale. The official race time clock was stopped when the riders reached the Champs Elysee due to rain making the famous cobble stones slippery. However, the rain stopped and the stones dried during the eight final laps of the famous road, and time-bonuses were awarded for the stage win. Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, riding for T-Mobile, won the stage after his break-away from the field 1,500m out could not be reeled in by the peloton, relegating the sprinters to lower placings. The 20s time bonus moved Vinokurov to fifth overall in the race. As Armstrong was presented the final Yellow Jersey, he was quoted in the press as saying in a mixture of French and English, ""Vive le Tour, forever."" The winning Yellow Jersey is awarded to the cyclist who had the best overall performance throughout the tour's circuit. After the awards ceremony, Armstrong discussed what comes next in his life, mentioning that defeating cancer by raising awareness and funds is his new goal. ""We know how to train and prepare for the Tour,"" he says. ""If we win, it is a success. Cancer is not and will not be that way. It is a different kind of fight. It's not something that lasts three weeks. ""Along the way there will be victories and defeats. There are going to be survivors and people who aren't going to make it. My goal and my responsibility is to make sure that we don't forget ... how devastating cancer has been. I can help change that."" ""I sit here as a person who considers myself totally cured,"" he says. ""But one of those people who was along the side of the road over the last three weeks might have breast cancer and might die in three months. ""How can they not be cured? The illness is complicated; there are hundreds of different illnesses and cell types, little bastards inside who don't agree with what we throw at them, who don't want to die."" Armstrong has been a member of the President's Cancer Panel since 2002. He feels that his role is to get the funds to keep that research alive, saying that ""we have the smartest people in the world"" already working on cures. ""Funding is tough to come by these days,"" he says. ""The biggest downside to a war in Iraq is what you could do with that money. What does a war in Iraq cost a week? A billion? Maybe a billion a day? The budget for the National Cancer Institute is four billion. That has to change. It needs to become a priority again. ""Polls say people are much more afraid of cancer than of a plane flying into their house or a bomb or any other form of terrorism. It is a priority for the American public."""

sport,"Vail, Colorado, United States &amp;mdash; Yesterday, Wikinews sat down with Australian blind Paralympic skier Melissa Perrine who was participating in a national team training camp in Vail, Colorado. Wikinews This is Melissa Perrine. And are you like Jess Gallagher and just here training and not competing? ::Melissa Perrine: I'm not competing right now. WNIQ And you competed in 2010 in Vancouver? ::MP: I did. Yeah. WNIQ And who was your guide? ::MP: Andy Bor. WNIQ Why a male guide? He's got to have different skis, and he can't turn exactly the same way. ::MP: I think that with me it was just that Andy was the fittest person that was with the team when I came along. He used to be an assistant coach with the team before I started with him. WNIQ And you guys have a good relationship? ::MP: Yeah! WNIQ Like a husband and wife relationship without the sex? ::MP: No, not at all. (laughs) Older brother maybe. Good relationship though. We get along really well. WNIQ So have you ever lost communications on the course in an embarrassing moment? ::MP: We ski courses without communications. (unintelligible) WNIQ You're a B3 then? ::MP: I'm a B2. WNIQ So you can see even less than Jessica Gallagher. ::MP: Yes. WNIQ How do you ski down a course when you can't even see it? ::MP: Andy! WNIQ You just said you had no communications! ::MP: Oh, I just have to be a lot closer to him. WNIQ So if he's close enough you can overcome that issue? ::MP: Yeah. WNIQ Why are you doing skiing? ::MP: Why? I enjoy it. WNIQ You enjoy going fast? ::MP: I love going fast. I like the challenge of it. WNIQ Even though you can't see how fast you're going. ::MP: Oh yes. It's really good. It's enjoyable. It's a challenge. I love the sport, I love the atmosphere. WNIQ I've asked the standing skiers, who's the craziest Paralympic skiers? Is it the ones who are on the sit skis, the blind ones or the ones missing limbs? ::MP: I probably think it's the sit skiers who are a bit nuts. I think we all think the other categories are a bit mental. I wouldn't jump on a sit ski and go down the course. Or put the blindfold on and do the same thing. WNIQ B1 with the black goggles. Is your eye sight degenerative? ::MP: No, I'm pretty stable. WNIQ Not going to become a B1 any time soon? ::MP: Oh God, I hope not. No, I'm pretty stable so I don't envision getting much blinder than I am now unless something goes wrong. WNIQ And you're trying for Sochi? ::MP: Definitely. WNIQ And you think your chances are really good? ::MP: I think I've got a decent chance. I just have to keep training like I have been. WNIQ Win a medal this time? ::MP: I'd like to. That's the intention. (laughs) WNIQ Do you like the media attention you've gotten? Do you wish there was more for yourself and winter sports, or of women athletes in general? ::MP: I think that promoting women in sport and the winter games is more important than promoting myself. I'm quite happy to stay in the background, but if I can do something to promote the sport, or promote women in the sport, especially because we've got such a small amount of women competing in skiing, especially in blind skiing. I think that's more important overall. WNIQ Most skiers are men? ::MP: There's more men competing in skiing, far more. The standards are a bit higher with the males than with the females. WNIQ The classification system for everyone else is functional ability, and you guys are a medical classification. Do you think you get a fair shake in terms of classification? Are you happy with the classification? ::MP: I think I'm happy with it, the way it's set out. With vision impairment I'm a B2, against other B2s. It may be the same category, but we have different disabilities, so there's not much more they can do. I think it's as fair as they possibly can. WNIQ You like the point system? You're okay with it? Competing against B1s and B3s even though you're a B2? ::MP: The factors even all that out. The way they've got it at the moment, I don't have any issues with them, the blind categories. WNIQ What was it that got you skiing in the first place? ::MP: An accident, basically. Complete by chance. A friend of mine in the Department of Recreation used to run skiing camps in the South West Sydney region, and she had a spare spot at one of the camps. Knew that I was vision impaired, and: ""Do you want to come along?"" ""Yeah, why, not, give it a go."" This was back when I was about twelve, thirteen. I went, and I loved it. Went back again, and again, and again. And for the first five or six years I just skied for like a week a season sort of thing, like, you're on a camp. Fell in love with the sport; my skiing and the mountain atmosphere, I love it, and then, when I finished my HSC, I decided to take myself off to Canada, and skiing Kimberley, the disabled race program that was run by the ex-Australian who coaches Steve Boba, and I'd heard about it through Disabled Winter Sports Australia. And I thought I'd spend some time in Canada, which is for skiing, and had a year off between school and uni, so... first time I ran through a race course actually. It was pretty awesome. So I went back again the next year, and Steve Boba recommended me to Steve Graham, and he watched me skiing in September in the South Island, and invited me on a camp with the Australian team, and I trained for Vancouver, and I qualified, and I said ""sure, why not?"" And here I am! WNIQ So you liked Vancouver? ::MP: It was just an amazing experience. I came into Vancouver... I had quite a bad accident on a downhill course in Sestriere about seven weeks out from the games, and I fractured my pelvis. So, I was coming into Vancouver with an injury and I had only just recovered and was in quite a lot of pain. So it was an amazing experience and I was quite glad I did it, but wish for a different outcome. WNIQ So you are more optimistic about Sochi then? ::MP: Yes. WNIQ One of the things about skiing is that it's really expensive to do. How do you afford to ski given how expensive it is? And the fact that you need a guide who's got his own expenses. ::MP: I'm lucky enough to rank quite high in the world at the moment, so due to my ranking I'm awarded a certain amount of funding from the Australian Sports Commission, which covers my equipment and expenses, and the team picks up training costs and travel costs. All I've got to pay for is food and my own equipment, which is good, so I've managed to do it a budget. WNIQ What do you do outside of skiing, because you look kind of young? And you being not like, 30 or 40? ::MP: I'm 24. I'm a student still. WNIQ Which university? ::MP: University of Western Sydney. It's my third university degree. I've completed two others prior to this one that I'm doing now. WNIQ Which degree? That you're currently pursuing. ::MP: Currently, physiotherapy. WNIQ Because of your experience with sport? ::MP: Not really, except that my experience with sport certainly helped my interest and kind of fueled a direction to take in the physiotherapy field when I'm finished my degree, but more the medical side of injury, rehabilitation that got me interested in physiotherapy to begin with, burns rehabilitation and things like that. WNIQ You view yourself a full-time student as opposed to a full-time professional skier. ::MP: Not really. I'm a student when uni's on and when uni's finished I'm a skier. The way that the term structure is in Australia it gives me all this time to ski. The uni starts at the end of February and goes to the beginning of June, and then we've got a six or seven week break until beginning or mid-August, and uni starts again then, and we go up to mid way through November, and then we've got a break again. Skiing fits in very nicely to that. WNIQ What's the route for qualification to Sochi for you. ::MP: Just maintaining my points. At the moment I've qualified. I just need to maintain my points, keep my points under, and then I qualify for the Australian team. WNIQ So there's a chance they could say no? ::MP: If I'm skiing really badly. An injury. WNIQ Or if you're like those Australian swimmers who had the guns... ::MP: I've no sign of picking up a gun any time soon. Giving a blind girl a gun is not a good idea. (laughs) WNIQ It just seemed to us that Sochi was so far away on out hand, and yet seemed to be in everybody's mind. It's on their program. Sixteen months away? ::MP: Yes, something like that. Sixteen. I think it's been on our mind ever since Vancouver was over and done with. Next season, that was that, it was like: ""what are our goals for the next four years?"" And it was, ""What are our goals for the next three years and two years?"" And subsequently, next season, it's Sochi. What we need to work on, what we need to accomplish for then, to be as ready as possible. WNIQ What is your favourite event of all the skiing ones? You like the downhill because it's fast? Or you like Giant Slalom because it's technically challenging? Or... ::MP: I prefer the speed events. The downhill; frightens me but I do love the adrenalin. I'm always keen to do a downhill. But I think Super G might just be my favourite. WNIQ Do you do any other adrenalin junkie type stuff? Do you go bungee jumping? Jumping out of airplanes? Snowboarding? ::MP: I don't snowboard, no. I have jumped out of a plane. I thought that was fun but downhill has got more adrenalin than jumping out of a plane, I found. I do mixed martial arts and judo. That's my other passion. WNIQ Have you thought of qualifying for the Summer Paralympics in judo? ::MP: As far as I know, Australia doesn't have a judo program for the Paralympics. But, if I ever get good enough, then sure. WNIQ They sent one. ::MP: They've sent one, and he's amazing. He beats up blind guys, able bodieds, quite constantly. I've seen video of him fight, and he's very very good. If I ever reach that level, then sure, it's something I'd look into it. WNIQ Does judo help with your skiing? ::MP: Yes, it increases my agility and balance, and strength, for sure. WNIQ I want to let you get back to changing. Thank you very much."
sport,"The mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia were just announced. Based on mythological characters, they are Miga, Quatchi and Sumi. Miga, a sea bear who lives in the ocean with her family pod near Tofino, and Quatchi, a young sasquatch, represent the Olympics, while Sumi represents the Paralympics that follow afterward. A sea bear is a First Nations creature, part killer whale, part Kermode spirit bear. While illustrated as being taller than the other characters, the mascot costume of Quatchi is the same height as the other two characters. The third mascot, Sumi, an animal-guardian spirit, is a Thunderbird that wears the hat of an orca. Sumi will be the mascot of the Paralympics. In 2004, the Times Colonist suggested a marmot might be a good mascot, except for their winter hibernation. The organizers still chose one, named Mukmuk, as their ""virtual only"" counterpart. After the Olympic logo design was leaked the day before the 2005 announcement, organizers were extremely tight lipped until today's news conference at a Surrey school. They apparently didn't do any development on the characters on internet-enabled computers, to ensure the images or information wouldn't slip out. The characters were designed by the Vancouver and Los Angeles-based Meomi Design. Their characters have been used as part of iGoogle, a customizable homepage option from Google, as well as Electronic Arts, Girls Inc., Time Out Magazine, Cyworld, Nick Jr., Bang-on Clothing, and CBC4Kids. The Vancouver organizers have a CDN$46-million merchandising program; previous Olympics have made as much as $100 million from mascot-related products. René Fasel, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Coordination Commission commented that ""The IOC welcomes these imaginative new additions to the Olympic Family as they take their place on the world stage today - a symbol of the Games and of Canada. We know that when Olympians, Paralympians and visitors from around the globe arrive in British Columbia at Games time, they will fall under the spell of these captivating characters."" The characters first appearance will be at a Bay store in the Lower Mainland; HBC is a major sponsor of the Games. They will then make their way to schools, take a break through the Christmas season, and fly to Ottawa for the Winterlude festival. Many respondents on the CBC.ca forums complained that the characters were poorly designed, and objected to the anime influence. One early commenter posted: ""these mascots do represent BC very well... someone must have been smoking A LOT of BC bud when they created these things. Maybe the dealer was that marmot that no one can see."" One poster suggests the Miga character is inaccurate: ""Family pods are residential (not transients or offshore!) who prefer sheltered water."" According to the poster, they are ""rarely seen"" on the west coast of Vancouver Island, where Tofino is. One forum poster took offense to the characters: ""As a person ... of full First Nations descent I want to say that these mascots are offensive."" Some felt that they were a nice change of pace, from the ""regular run-of-the-mill Canadiana that has been recycled over and over again. Vancouver is a new city for new things and fresh faces, a place for experimentation... I think we need to remember that these characters are for the kids and for fun. What kind of a statement would trotting out another red and white beaver and moose make? That we are imaginative with new ideas? They'll grow on us."" Native offense to the Vancouver Olympic mascots would not be unheard of. While the Olympic logo was applauded by various First Nations and Inuit leaders, including the Nunavut premier, one criticized the image for the Games as looking like the video game character Pac Man. Local leaders complained it didn't represent their cultures, but the culture of the far north; interestingly the logo designer was of sure Haida ancestry. Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq complained that traditional inuksuit (inuksuk) never had a head, legs, or arms. Irniq says that the logo resembles an inunguat, which is a much more recent invention made by non-Inuit people in Nunavut. Roughly 1600 designs were submitted. Similarly, the mascot design process was open to all, but there was no word yet on numbers of entrants. The British Columbian chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada took issue with the ""token"" amount of money paid to the winner, compared to the work done and the fact the images were those of VANOC in perpetuity, with no usage fees paid. VANOC later approached the Society, to set minimum standards for the design."
sport,"JapanA long-lost statue of the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) Harland 'Colonel' Sanders was finally pulled up from a river in Osaka Prefecture, western Japan. Though covered with mud, he was still smiling as he was 23 and a half years before. In October 1985, the statue was tossed into the river by some overjoyed fans of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, which led to a 'legend' known as ""the Curse of Colonel Sanders."" On Tuesday afternoon, the upper body of the reinforced plastic statue was found unexpectedly. Osaka City had a plan to lay a paved path along Dōtonbori River, and a contractor diver noticed a figure near the bottom while checking for unexploded World War II bombs. The workers pulled it up, and Tigers fans among them recognized the figure as the Colonel. The lower body was also found on Wednesday morning. The statue still lacks some parts like eyeglasses, feet and left hand, but the contractor reportedly says it's almost impossible for the rest to be found, due to lack of visibility in the water. Osaka City will return the statue, about 180 cm in height, to KFC Japan. Reportedly the company is considering displaying the statue at its franchise in the Tigers home Hanshin Kōshien Stadium in Nishinomiya City, Hyōgo Prefecture (neighboring Osaka Pref.). The story of the Hanshin Tigers and the Colonel statue dates back to October 1985. Because the team got the Central League title for the first time in 21 years, ecstatic fans crowded around Dōtonbori. Some were so overjoyed that they jumped into the river for the team players. Unfortunately no one among them looked like Randy Bass, the team's star slugger. Near them was a KFC franchise (closed 1998), and they presumably found resemblance between Bass and 'Colonel' Sanders (both were bearded). They started to chant ""Baassu, Baassu"" and tossed the Colonel statue into the river in honor of their hero. The team also won the Japan Series later in that year. However, this was the Hanshin Tigers' last triumph. The team soon fell into a long-term slump, and finished at the bottom among 6 Central League teams in 10 of 16 seasons by 2001. During the slump, some baseball lovers in Japan jokingly said ""it was brought by the Curse of Colonel Sanders,"" which became a legend. The Tigers again got the League title in 2003 and 2005, but the fans' dream of another triumph has not yet come true. Asked whether the 'curse' will be lifted by the discovery, Hanshin Tigers manager Akinobu Mayumi said ""now we can not lay (our luck) to it."" A KFC Japan press officer said, ""Truly, Sanders is a 'gentleman'. The 'curse' must end, and he must back Hanshin up to be a Japan Series Champion."""
sport,"issues/basketball Clif Brown led the charge for Niagara, scoring 32 points and shooting 6-11 from behind the arc in helping the Purple Eagles defeat the Florida A&amp;M Rattlers 77-69 on Tuesday night. Brown, despite playing the last four minutes in danger of fouling out, shot 10-18 from the field and picked up six rebounds to lead Niagara. Charron Fisher, leading scorer for the Eagles, contributed 13 points and 8 rebounds despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half. The Rattlers, despite outshooting the Eagles percentage-wise 46 to 40, could not catch up to the Eagles, thanks in part to a team that went 7-18 from the free throw line. Niagara, by contrast, went 21-28 from the free throw line, and also hit four more 3-pointers than the Rattlers. It was the first opening-round experience for Niagara, who advance to play the Kansas Jayhawks on Friday in Chicago. Florida A&amp;M had been to Dayton for the ""play-in"" game once before, when they defeated Lehigh in 2004.

sport,"After this weekend, Texas can celebrate not only bringing home the Big 12 Conference trophy but also having the All-Big 12 Player of the Year, P.J. Tucker, and the first recipient of the Defensive Player of the Year award, LaMarcus Aldridge. Rival Kansas, who tied with Texas for the No. 1 slot in the conference but was denied the trophy, had coach Bill Self named Coach of the Year and Brandon Rush named Freshman of the Year. Michael Neal of Oklahoma was named Newcomer of the Year. The All-Big 12 awards are selected by the league's head coaches, who are not allowed to vote for their own players. Tucker, a unanimous All-Big 12 First Team choice, is the first Longhorn to earn Big 12 Player of the Year recognition. He leads the team and ranks sixth overall in the conference in scoring (16.1), while leading the league in rebounding (9.0). He is also fourth in field goal percentage with a .531 mark. He has led UT in scoring seven times in league play and is second in the Big 12 overall with 10 double-doubles. Aldridge wins the first defensive honor awarded by the Big 12. He is first in the Big 12 with 59 blocks overall, including 27 in conference games. He has 81 defensive rebounds in 2005-06, ranking third in the league. Aldridge can score as well, leading the Big 12 with 13 double-doubles. Neal is the second-straight Sooner and fourth overall to win Newcomer of the Year. One of the top long-range threats in the Big 12, the junior college transfer ranks first in conference games in 3-point field goal percentage (.495) and 3-point field goals per game (3.86). He is also averaging a team-best 14.8 points in league action. He has shot 50.0 percent or better from beyond the arc 11 times this season. Rush is the first freshman in conference history to be named to the All-Big 12 First Team. The top scoring freshman in the conference with 15.1 points per game, Rush also ranks seventh with a 6.6 rebounding average. He is the fourth KU player to surpass 400 points (408) in his freshman season. The native of Kansas City, Mo. is the second Jayhawk to win freshman accolades (Jeff Boschee, 1998-99). Self wins his first Big 12 coaching honor and the third for a Jayhawk mentor. After returning just 21.2 percent of his scoring from a year ago, Self guided KU to a share of the Big 12 regular season championship, its sixth in league annals. Starting three freshmen and two sophomores, Kansas recorded its 18th straight season with at least 22 victories.

sport,"Homebush Bay, New South Wales &amp;mdash; Wikinews sat down with Great Britain men's national wheelchair basketball player Joni Pollock before a practice session at the Rollers &amp; Gliders World Challenge in Sydney. British-born Pollock was born with the condition spina bifida. He explained he could walk with difficulty up until age twelve or thirteen, after which he began using a wheelchair. Shortly after this, he began playing wheelchair basketball. He attended a disabilities tournament for children with disabilities in England, where he tried both wheelchair basketball, since he came from a town where team sports were popular; and wheelchair tennis, as he'd played with an able-bodied friend. Ultimately, he chose wheelchair basketball as it was a team sport. Wikinews asked Pollock about being loud towards his team mates during the match on July 20 between the Australian Rollers and the Great Britain Bulldogs. He said he was out of wheelchair basketball for nine months due to a pressure sore and surgery on his shoulder, and has been making a comeback since January, with the doctors and physiotherapists giving him the all-clear in April. On that night, he said, the Australian team used bullying tactics and some of his teammates on the British team didn't step up to win the game. He also said that no matter what team his team plays against, he has a target on his back because of his calibre of playing in the game, and his team failed to to understand it that night, leaving him frustrated with his team and himself; and, he hates coming to Australia during a Paralympic year since the home town &amp;mdash;that is, Australian&amp;mdash; referees do not protect the visiting team from the home team's dirty playing, which puts the British team's gold medal prospects in jeopardy. Wikinews also asked Pollock his opinions regarding Oscar Pistorius. Pollock believes Pistorius shouldn't be competing in the Olympics if other Paralympic athletes can't compete. He also mentioned reservations about certain technical aspects, such as whether Pistorius would be the same height if he still had his legs rather then his prosthetic legs. Asked about 5 point players playing in wheelchair basketball, he said he believes 5 point players can play with other point players but not in the Paralympics, and said 5 point players currently play in the domestic league but not at the elite level, to boost the number of players participating and to help the development of the game. Wikinews also questioned him about tattoos worn by members of the British team. In previous years, he said, only one or two forwards had tattoos, but now almost everyone has one as having tattoos is currently in fashion. He said he got his first tattoo at the age of sixteen and only recently had it removed. He also has tattoos on his right arm, depicting the logos of the Paralympics and World championships in which he competed. Pollocks's team begins its London campaign on August 30, against the Germany men's national wheelchair basketball team."

sport,"The jury in the Isiah Thomas sexual harassment trial revealed a guilty verdict Tuesday, ruling that the current New York Knicks coach subjected former Madison Square Garden executive Anucha Browne Sanders to unwanted sexual advances and verbal insults. In a minor victory for Thomas, the ruling also said that Thomas will not have to pay punitive damages. However, Thomas' employer, Madison Square Garden, was also found guilty of harassment and will have to pay millions dollars worth of punitive damages to Browne Sanders. The ugly three-week trial originated with a US$10 million lawsuit filed by Browne Sanders, the former senior vice president of marketing and business operations for the Knicks. She was fired by the team in December of 2006, and following her dismissal she filed the explosive lawsuit alleging that Madison Square Garden fostered an environment of sexism and inequality, personified by the conduct of Isiah Thomas. She stated that Thomas repeatedly called her a ""bitch"" and a ""ho"", and pressured her to kiss him and said that he loved her. She also stated that the firing was the result of her filing a complaint about Thomas. Madison Square Garden, and the coach known for his charismatic and emotional demeanor, denied the charges. After the guilty verdict was read, a relieved Browne Sanders hugged her family and friends who were present at the trial. Thomas met with his lawyers, and while leaving the courthouse stated, ""“I’m innocent, very innocent, and I did not do the things she has accused me in this courtroom of doing. I’m extremely disappointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case. I will appeal this, and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have.” Madison Square Garden is also expected to appeal the decision."

sport,"In a statement released today, former American baseball star Mark McGwire admitted to the use of performance-enhancing drugs during his career, including the 1998 season, when he broke Roger Maris's single season record for home runs, hitting 70 of them. McGwire admitted to the use of drugs in the late 1980s and during most of the 1990s. There had been wide speculation about McGwire's use of performance-enhancing drugs, as he came from an era of baseball that has been dubbed the ""steroid era"" because of the high use of performance enhancing drugs throughout Major League Baseball. ""I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era...I shouldn't have done it and for that I'm truly sorry...It's time for me to talk about the past and to confirm what people have suspected,"" said some of the statement released by the St. Louis Cardinals today. McGwire had recently been hired as the Cardinal's hitting coach and was set to begin the job this season. McGwire, 46, had been regarded as one of the most powerful hitters of his time. Over his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, which is currently tied with Alex Rodriguez, who has also admitted to steroid use. McGwire is now one of the six players in the top 15 home run hitters of all time that has either confessed to or been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. McGwire's best season came in 1998, when he set the record for most home runs in a single season. After a race throughout the final months of the season with Sammy Sosa, he ended with 70 home runs, easily beating Roger Maris's previous record of 61 (This record was later broken by Barry Bonds, who now holds the current record of 73). ""I'm sure people will wonder if I could have hit all those home runs had I never taken steroids. I had good years when I didn't take any and I had bad years when I didn't take any. I had good years when I took steroids and I had bad years when I took steroids,"" said McGwire to the Associated Press. According to McGwire, the steroids were used for the enhancement of his play as well as to recover from the several injuries that he suffered between the 1990 and 1994 seasons. In the statement, he also commended the MLB Player's Association for attempting to remove steroids from the game. ""Baseball is really different now— it's been cleaned up. The commissioner and the Player's Association implemented testing and they cracked down, and I'm glad they did,"" McGwire stated."" Since he used the steroids before the current rules were in place, McGwire will likely not be disciplined by the league or the MLBPA. In 2005, McGwire was called to the U.S. Congress and refused to answer questions about his steroid use, saying that he did ""...not want to talk about the past."" It is unknown if the MLB will investigate into this matter. Mark McGwire is currently tied for eighth on the all-time home runs list. he played 16 Major League seasons and retired following the 2001 season. He is currently the hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals."
sport,"Dr. Christiane Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique, which is a World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) certified lab. Dr. Ayotte said on Tuesday (Aug. 23) that three ethically critical, and important, scientific questions were raised by a four-page doping allegation in the French cycling daily L'Équipe. L'Équipe released lab data with a medical identification allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of cyclist Lance Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France. Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations that EPO deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. The first ethical problem , in her opinion, is that an adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples, as required by WADA regulations. She states that there are normally two samples, ""A"" and ""B"". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's ""B"" samples. Armstrong's ""A"" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the ""A"" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. The second ethical problem, in Ayotte's view, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that L'Équipe disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. ""It seems to me,"" Ayotte continued, ""that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements."" Ayotte continued, ""I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind."" Lance Armstrong has responded on his website, branding L'Équipe's reporting as being ""nothing short of tabloid journalism."" Armstrong says: ""I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs."" Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, It's Not About the Bike: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. ""It was the only thing that kept me alive,"" he wrote. Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Leblanc said; ""For the first time&amp;mdash;and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts&amp;mdash;someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body."""

sport,"GermanyThe German First Bundesliga ended its season on Saturday. VfL Wolfsburg claimed its first season title with a win over UEFA Cup runners-up Werder Bremen by 5–1. The win was Wolfsburg's sixteenth of seventeen at home. Wolfsburg went into the match holding a two-point advantage over Bayern Munich and VfB Stuttgart, who played each other at the same time. Since VfL had a goal difference of 35 to FC Bayern's 28, even a draw would have effectively clinched the title for them. Additionally, Wolfsburg faced a tired Werder Bremen side that had just lost the UEFA Cup final to Shaktar Donetsk after extra time. VfL got the scoring started after six minutes, when Zvjezdan Misimović latched onto a loose ball just outside the Werder penalty area and put it into the top of the net. Nine minutes later, Grafite, the league's leading goalscorer, made it 27 goals on the season. The game was effectively over when Sebastian Prödl scored an own goal in the 26th minute. Though Diego pulled one back for Werder five minutes later, it would not be enough. Second half goals from Grafite (56th) and Edin Džeko (74th) put an exclamation point on the afternoon for Wolfsburg. However, this was the last game at the helm for Wolfsburg's manager, Felix Magath. His contract was not renewed and he will be heading to FC Schalke 04, who lost their final game under interim managers Mike Büskens, Oliver Reck and Youri Mulder. Bayern won 2–1 over Stuttgart, so they join Wolfsburg in the UEFA Champions League 2009–10 group stage, while Stuttgart must start from the play-off round. Hertha BSC and HSV will represent the Bundesliga in the UEFA Europa League. Hertha managed to hang on despite being beaten 4–0 by seventeenth-placed Karlsruher SC. referee= Thorsten Kinhöfer (Herne)"
sport,"Both golf and rugby are set to return to the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee voted to include the sports at its executive board meeting in Berlin today. Rugby, specifically rugby union, and golf were selected over five other sports to be considered to participate in the Olympics. Squash, karate and roller sports tried to get onto the Olympic program as well as baseball and softball, which were voted out of the Olympic Games in 2005. The vote must still be ratified by the full IOC at it's October meeting in Copenhagen. Golf will return after a 112-year absence from the Games; the sport was last played at the 1900 and 1904 Games. Rugby union, in its full 15-a-side version, was included in four Olympic Games, with its last appearance being in 1924. If the sports are included after the October meeting, rugby will return to the Olympics as rugby sevens, a version of rugby union with seven players per side and 7- or 10-minute halves instead of the standard 40-minute halves. Elite rugby director Rob Andrew said that ""Rugby Union is played in more than 100 countries and has a superb opportunity to further develop and grow through its new partnership with the IOC."" The format that has been proposed for golf is two 72-hole tournaments, one each for men and women, with 60 competitors each. The top 15 players in the world will qualify automatically and the major golf schedules will arrange around the Olympic Games. Not all were happy with the proposed inclusions to the game. IOC President Jacques Rogge defended the decision, saying that ""this is the young generation that will be at its peak in 2016. The same question was raised time and time again when tennis and ice-hockey were introduced. Ask top tennis players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, ask the NHL players, ask the NBA basketball players. They all want to go to the games &amp;mdash; they are absolutely not concerned about that."" One of the sports that lost out was squash. Squash Federation President N Ramachandran commented on his disappointment that squash was not included in the games. If the sports are included, they will first be conducted in the 2016 Games. Women's boxing is now set to appear at the 2012 Games."

sport,"Two web sites purporting to sell tickets to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games due to open in Beijing, China on Friday have been the subject of lawsuits from the International Olympic Committee in United States courts in recent weeks. The web sites, beijingticketing.com and beijing-2008tickets.com, were designed to resemble official sites and often appeared above the official sites in Google searches, and scammed some victims out of up to US$50,000 each for tickets to events such as the Opening Ceremony and swimming, which were listed despite the official Beijing ticket web site stating that tickets to all events had sold out as of July 27. The sites are believed to have taken in millions of dollars in total. Ken Gamble, a private investigator from Sydney, Australia, believes the sites are operated by Terance Shepherd, whom Gamble has been tracking for several years in relation to other fraudulent web sites selling tickets to events such as the FIFA World Cup. According to Gamble, Shepherd's modus operandi involves setting up the fake web sites, overselling the tickets, and then failing to produce the tickets. ""The story's always the same,"" Gamble said, ""it's an 'unfortunate mistake' or someone has 'let them down'. They promise a refund, which never happens, and the credit companies end up paying all the refunds."" Shepherd owns a home in the London suburb of Blackheath, although authorities believe he is currently hiding in Barbados. On Monday, beijingticketing.com customers received an email from someone named ""Alan Scott"", claiming that the site's ticket supplier had filed for bankruptcy. The email recommended that customers should contact their credit card companies to seek refunds ""immediately"", and said that the company would set up a call centre to provide assistance to its customers. However, the site has been shut down and a phone number previously listed on it has been disconnected. The company's address, in Phoenix, Arizona, was found to be an empty office space. Visa International has stated that victims who used their Visa card to pay should be able to get their money back, but it is not yet clear whether the same will apply to all customers."

Just 17 seconds had passed when Ribery took a shot that missed by inches . Riemann made his first save from Altintop on three minutes, However, almost gave Burghausen the lead when Hungarian midfielder Levente Schultz forced Oliver Kahn into a save near the post. Ottmar Hitzfeld: ”We basically played well. We played convincing football and made further progress. The problem was wastefulness. Sometimes we were unlucky, and sometimes we were denied by an outstanding Manuel Riemann. Compliments to Burghausen, they played above themselves, they were totally motivated, quick, aggressive, and they kept our defenders busy too. It was a cracking tie with everything you want from the Cup. But the match also showed we still have a lot of work to do. We have to do a lot more than simply turn up, even the last doubter must be convinced of that by now.“ Oliver Kahn: “All I’ve been doing for the last 14 years is remain focused until I’m needed. Obviously, you’re always pleased when you save a couple of penalties. Wacker fought till they dropped, but I have to say I saw a fantastic Bayern team, playing fantastic football, but failing to put away its chances.“ Philipp Lahm: “It was decent stuff from us. We created any number of chances and we were very solid at the back, but it’s always hard work when you fail to take your chances.“ Mark Van Bommel: “We weren’t great, but we weren’t bad either. You normally lose matches where you have 20 shots but none of them goes in. Young Riemann was lucky in that we kept shooting at him, and when we didn’t, we hit the bar or the post.“ Ingo Anderbrügge (Wacker coach): “I don’t see it in a negative light at all. Obviously you’re disappointed after you’ve been one penalty away from a massive upset. My lads showed we have a decent team again. I’m proud of the way they managed to match Bayern for so long. That’ll give us confidence for the league. Manuel Riemann is a pretty sorted guy for his age, he could have a bright future ahead of him.“ Manuel Riemann (Wacker keeper): “Disappointment is the main emotion at the moment, because we were so close to a miracle. But I want to praise the team for the fight we put up.”"

Also sent to Memphis were Pau's brother Marc Gasol, and Aaron McKie, who was signed by the Lakers the same day. Lakers General Manger Mitch Kupchak said, ""Pau is a proven player of All-Star caliber in this league who can score and rebound and he's still a young player. We feel this move strengthens our team in the short term as well as the long term."" The Commercial Appeal, a Memphis newspaper, also reports that Grizzlies forward Stromile Swift will be traded to the New Jersey Nets for center Jason Collins in a deal expected to be finalized on Monday. Gasol is averaging 18.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game this season, while Brown has a season average 5.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game.The move officially ended the former number one over all pick's dubious stay in Los Angeles. In his two plus years with the Lakers, Brown never was able to play consistent enough to please the front office. The ability of Los Angeles to acquire Gasol for Brown, Crittenton and two future first round draft picks has some around the league scratching their heads.

sport,"United States Cliffwildes Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has received a lifetime ban from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and has been fined $US2.5million for his racist comments this week. Sterling, who has owned the team since 1981, was overheard telling a woman, identified as girlfriend V. Stiviano, not to bring black people to games or associate with them. The comments have caused an uproar, not just in the NBA, but within the Clippers team. In protest, players wore their warm-up jerseys inside out before their Game 4 playoff loss against the Golden State Warriors, while in other games throughout the league the San Antonio Spurs played in black socks and the Miami Heat practiced with their warm-up shirts inside out to mimic the LA Clippers. Former NBA player Kevin Johnson, now mayor of Sacramento, said the league needed to hand out the maximum possible penalty. While NBA legend Michael Jordan, owner of the Charlotte Bobcats said there is no room in the NBA, or anywhere, for this kind of hatred. The conversation took place on April 9, when a man's voice, later identified as Sterling's, told the woman not to pose for photos with black men, including Hall of Famer Ervin ""Magic"" Johnson. Sterling goes onto say it annoys him that she has to promote her association with black people. It isn't the first time Sterling has caused controversy with racist comments. Back in 2009 he was sued by his former General Manager Elgin Baylor who criticised Sterling's attitude and quoted him as saying ""I'm offering you good money for a poor black kid"" when negotiating a contract with Danny Manning. The situation is far from over as Sterling is refusing to sell the team, and the other teams have lobbied against him to force him to sell. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver needs 75% support, or 23 out of the 30 teams, to force Sterling out of the league permanently. ""The fine will be donated to organisations dedicated to anti-discrimination and tolerance efforts that will be jointly selected by the NBA and the Players' Association"" Mr Silver said."

sport,"American Major League Baseball third baseman Alex Rodriguez, a star player for the New York Yankees, admitted in an interview on sports network ESPN that he used performance-enhancing drugs during 2001 through 2003. ""I did take a banned substance, and for that, I'm very sorry,"" Rodriguez told ESPN's Peter Gammons. ""When I arrived at Texas in 2001 I felt an enormous amount of pressure to perform."" source=Alex Rodriguez Last week, Sports Illustrated reported that the baseball player, nicknamed 'A-Rod', tested positive in 2003 for Primobolan and testosterone, two substances that have been banned by the league. During the 2003 season, Rodriguez was playing with the Texas Rangers, and was the winner of the American League MVP Award and was American League leader in home runs. According to sources, Rodriguez was one of 104 players named on a list for testing positive before the 2003 season. The list was compiled in an attempt to determine whether the MLB needed to begin conducting random drug testing. After the initial report Rodriguez was approached by Sports Illustrated while he was training for the upcoming season in a Miami area gym. At that time, Rodriguez told the reporter ""You'll have to talk to the union."" He was also asked for an explanation of his positive test result, to which he commented ""I'm not saying anything."" According to a report by ESPN, sources claim that Rodriguez was aware that he tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. However, in December 2007 after United States Senator George J. Mitchell's Mitchell Report was released accusing such teammates of Rodriguez as Roger Clemens, Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte of steroid use, Rodriguez appeared on ABC's 60 Minutes and declined the use of any steroid or performance-enhancing drug. He also commented that he would not need the help of steroids, stating, ""I've never felt overmatched on the baseball field. I felt that if I did my, my work as I've done since I was, you know, a rookie back in Seattle, I didn't have a problem competing at any level."" Senator Mitchell stated in a prepared comment yesterday that his report had only named that players that ""had received credible evidence of their illegal purchase, possession, or use of performance enhancing substances."" He pointed out that he ""did not have access to the results of the 2003 drug testing, and to this day I do not know which players tested positive then."" The MLB declined to comment directly on the situation due to court orders on the list of names and documents, but did release a statement: ""Information and documents relating to the results of the 2003 MLB testing program are both confidential and under seal by court orders. We are prohibited from confirming or denying any allegation about the test results of any particular player by the court orders. Anyone with knowledge of such documents who discloses their contents may be in violation of those court orders."" source=Senator George J. Mitchell Rodriguez has been one of the many prominent American baseball players over the past few years who has been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Other prominent names include both the arguably greatest hitter and pitcher in Major League Baseball history, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. Bonds, the all-time Major League record holder for home runs, was linked to steroid use during the BALCO scandal in 2003, while Clemens was named in the Mitchell report in December of 2007. The executive vice president for labor relations of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, stated that league commissioner Bud Selig was ""disturbed"" by the linking of steroid use to Rodriguez. Commenting for the league, he said, ""Because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we cannot make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named."" The report by Sports Illustrated also made the claim that Gene Orza, the COO of the Major League Baseball Players Association informed Rodriguez of a random drug test that occurred in September of 2004, a test that was supposed to remain confidential to all players. The MLBPA denied the accusations, commenting ""There was no improper tipping of players in 2004 about the timing of drug tests. In September 2004 MLBPA attorneys met with certain players, but we are not able to confirm or deny the names of any players with whom we met."" When asked in the Sports Illustrated report, Orza declined to comment, stating ""I'm not interested in discussing this information with you."" source=MLBPA Statement The anonymous testing of players was started in 2003 by the MLB, in order to get a brief estimate of how many players were using performance-enhancing drugs, leading to the beginning of the mandatory, penalty-enforced testing that began in 2004. 1,198 players took the ""survey test"" in 2003, and the results were later stored in a laboratory in Las Vegas, with codes being used in place of the players names. However, a list of the players actual names that went with the list of codes was kept in a separate office in Long Beach, never intended to ever be together with the codes. In April 2004, federal agents with search warrants raided the two labs looking for information on the 2003 BALCO scandal test results of 10 players, including Barry Bonds. While searching, they found both the list of names and the codes, including the positive test result of Rodriguez. Following the investigation and raid, the MLBPA informed all 104 players on the list that their positive test data had been sized by the federal agents. source=José Canseco Former Major League Baseball star and self-confessed steroid user José Canseco told the media that the news was old, saying ""I said in my book Vindicated that he was a known steroid user before 2000. It's old news. I've been saying this forever. You guys are playing catch-up."" In the book, Canseco links Rodriguez to steroids through the claim that he saw him using the drugs. In his first book, Juiced, references to Rodriguez were removed by the publisher of the book because it could not be confirmed that Canseco actually saw Rodriguez taking steroids. According to the publisher, it was only after Canseco passed a lie detector test that information about Rodriguez was allowed into Vindicated. What do you think the positive test says about steroid use in baseball today? Does the test result affect the way you view Rodriguez's accomplishments as a player? Current senior advisor to the Texas Rangers John Hart commented on the situation in an interview with MLB Network. ""I think in the climate that we have today, you don't have much shock anymore. Obviously Alex probably is the best player in baseball. This has always been a special talent and the guy has been putting up Hall of Fame numbers since the day he showed up in the big leagues. I've been in the game for almost 40 years and it hurts a little bit, if in fact this is true. It breaks my heart for the game that we have this kind of thing occurring, But at the same time, a lot of people seem to have been caught in this net,"" he said. Since the positive test occurred in 2003 before penalties were instituted, Rodriguez will most likely not be suspended by the MLB as a result of the situation."

sport,"Real Madrid bookings_away = Ramos, Guti, Diarra (Yellow (4)), Diarra (Red (1)) Bayern Munich hosted Real Madrid at the Allianz Arena today in the second leg of the Champions League round of sixteen. The first leg saw Real coming out on top 3-2, but the two away goals by Bayern gave them a good chance in the second leg. Madrid were without David Beckham for the game, who orchestrated all 3 goals in the first leg, and he was replaced in the midfield by Raúl. Bayern played a strong side, with Lucas Podolski and Roy Makaay in attack, and Owen Hargreaves in the midfield. Any plans Real had made for the game went immediately out the window when Roy Makaay scored the fastest ever goal in a Champions League match after only 10 seconds. Real took the kickoff, and Roberto Carlos was immediately dispossessed by Salihamidzic, who passed in the ball to Makaay. The German striker neatly finished passed Iker Casillas to stun the Galacticos, and give the home side the lead. Bayern continued to press, and Real looked listless, as shots from Podolski and Makaay were saved by Casillas. Real coach Fabio Capello was quick to make changes in his team, and sent on Guti in place of Emerson. Casillas was again forced into action as van Buyten headed Sagnol's free kick towards the goal, but the keeper got down well to make the stop. Madrid finally began to play like a team, and substitute Guti had a chance after a neat backheel by Higuain found him, but the shot flew wide. Real continued pressing, and Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy headed a ball towards the net, but Oliver Kahn was easily able to cope with the low power effort. Raúl then struck an acrobatic effort towards the goal, but found only the side netting. After the restart, Real looked shaky at the back again as van Bommel found his way in on goal, but Casillas was again on hand to snuff out the danger. Oliver Kahn was then forced into action at the other end, as he pushed out a van Nistelrooy header off of a cross by Raúl. Bayern had a penalty claim, but were denied by referee Lubos Michel. It didn't matter however, and the resulting corner was met by Lucio's head, doubling Bayerns lead. Bayern had another chance minutes later, but a open header by Salihamidzic went wide. Raúl then had a chance for Real, but his header was directed straight to Kahn. Ruud van Nistelrooy was then denied a run on goal after a mistaken offside call was given by the linesman. On 80 minutes, Robinho was hauled down by van Bommel in the penalty area, and Real was awarded a penalty. Marco van Bommel was consequently given his second yellow of the match for arguing the point, and was sent off along with Diarra of Real for his part in the confrontation. Once everything settled, van Nistelrooy stepped up to the spot and sent the ball into the net, cutting the lead in half, but still leaving Real behind on aggregate. The game finished dramatically, as Ramos thought he had scored to tie the game, but the referee correctly judged that a hand had been used in the build up, and the goal was not counted. The game ended in a win for Bayern, and they will go on to the next round, while Real is left to focus on domestic play."

The FA Cup 6th round replay was forced after a Ronaldo penalty a week ago which tied the last match at 2-2, sending the second game to Old Trafford. Middlesbrough started with the deadly strike pair of Mark Viduka and Yakubu up front, while Manchester had Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney as paired strikers. United came out with the first good chances of the game as Wayne Rooney had an attempt on net, but saw his shot blocked by defender Jonathan Woodgate. Nemanja Vidic then had a chance for United off a Giggs corner, but his powerful header was held by keeper Mark Schwarzer. Ronaldo then had a shot on net after the ball fortuitously fell to his feet, but the Portuguese midfielders strike flew just wide. Middlesbrough survived through the first onslaught and had their first real chance on 16 minutes when a deflected pass by Xavier found its way to Mark Viduka, but his shot flew wide of Tomasz Kuszczak's goal. Woodgate soon saved Middlesbrough again as he blocked a cross net pass from Ronaldo which was aimed for a wide open Alan Smith. Wayne Rooney was then given a clear run in on goal after he was found by a well time through ball from Giggs, but Mark Schwarzer spread wide to snatch the ball from Rooney's feet. Mark Viduka then made space in the United penalty box and dropped off a pass for Stuart Downing, but his right footed shot flew wide yet again. Ronaldo again threatened 'Boro, but he saw his wide angled shot bang off the post after rounding Schwarzer. Rooney again was given a break away on net, but he was again stopped by the Australian Schwarzer. Soon after, Jonathan Woodgate brought Ronaldo down in the box, and United were awarded a penalty. Ronaldo sent the ball high and to the left of Schwarzer as the keeper went the wrong way, and United took the lead. Middlesbrough had little more in the way of attacking threat, with a wide shot by Morrison being all they could muster. The game did end on a sour note, however, after a few scuffles and a cynical challenge on Ronaldo by James Morrison saw several yellow cards handed out and Morrison was shown red. United will take on Watford in the semifinals of the cup while Middlesbrough have only the Premier League to focus on now, with their next match being played at West Ham."

Eight people have been arrested in connection to this ring, and up to 24 people are individuals of interest to federal agents and may be arrested before the investigation is over. According to records seized during the raids, customers of the pharmacies included Holyfield, Matthews, former baseball star Jose Canseco, and former pitcher Jason Grimsley. Investigators reportedly have found evidence that performance-enhancing drugs were prescribed to a number of professional athletes as well as international bodybuilders. Further evidence showed that Dr. Richard Rydze, team doctor of the Pittsburgh Steelers, purchased $150,000 worth of human growth hormone on his personal credit card. Calls to Dr. Rydze were not immediately returned. Those arrested include Stan and Naomi Loomis, owners of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. Two other employees of the pharmacy (including Loomis's brother, Mike) were arrested as well. P. David Soares, Albany County prosecutor, indicated in filings from his office that Signature is believed to be a ""producer"" of anabolic steroids. Grimsley and Rydze were reported to be customers of Signature Pharmacy. Holyfield, Matthews, and Canseco were allegedly on customer lists from Applied Pharmacy Services in Mobile, Alabama. Both pharmacies and their owners are implicated in the steroid ring. According to SI.com, Matthews received shipments of Genotropin, a synthetic growth hormone. The shipments were sent to the address of one of his former minor-league teammates in Mansfield, Texas. Matthews claimed he did not know why his name was on Applied Pharmacy's customer list.

The investigation was launched after the South African Paralympic Committee sent the IPC a formal letter of complaint following Oscar Pistorius raising concerns in the mixed zone following his silver medal finish in the 200 meters. The South Africans alleged runners from other countries were cheating by being measured using one set of competition prosthetics, then using different prosthetics during the race. The IPC sent representatives to the track to ask coaches if they were aware of changes between prosthetics being measured and being used on the track. According to the IPC, coaches were surprised to be asked this, as it would be extremely difficult to transition between differing prosthetics due to required changes in stride.

If Samoa is successful in getting the money for the equipment, the next challenge will be finding money to cover the cost of freighting it to Samoa. Tuala and the nation's athletics coach have previously held raffles, run events at a golf club, and run bake sales to assist in covering costs for developing disability sport in the country and look to do it again if they can get the grant.

The dressing room is a difficult place at the moment."" He also added, saying, ""You have to suffer the result first sometimes. I'm hugely proud of what we've done &amp;mdash; I couldn't have asked for any more. They've broken through a number of barriers in the past weeks.""

sport,"Pitcher Josh Hancock passed away early Sunday after crashing his car into a tow truck. The accident occurred on Interstate 64 in St. Louis, Missouri at about 12:30am, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 29 years old. Josh Hancock was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 1998 and made his Major League debut in 2002. He was later traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds before being signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006. He was part of the 2006 World Series Cardinals team, and a current member of the Cardinals roster. He had just played in Saturday afternoon's game against the Chicago Cubs, pitching three solid innings. Hancock was mourned around the league. The Cleveland Indians held a moment of silence before their game, displaying Hancock's picture on the scoreboard. Bud Selig, Commissioner of Major League Baseball, said ""All of baseball today mourns the tragic and untimely death of St. Louis pitcher Josh Hancock. He was a fine young pitcher who played an important role on last year's World Series championship team."" This is the second time in recent years that a Cardinals pitcher has died during the regular season. In 2002, Darryl Kile was found dead in his room at the team's hotel during a series against the Cubs in Chicago, Illinois. The final game of the Cardinals-Cubs series, scheduled for 7:00pm tonight, has been postponed because of the tragedy."
sport,"The French cycling newspaper L'Équipe is reporting that a drugs testing laboratory has discovered that Lance Armstrong, seven times winner of the Tour de France, used the banned substance EPO in the 1999 tour - his first victory after defeating testicular cancer. L'Equipe also points out that the results may tarnish Armstrong's image forever, and cast a shadow of doubt over his six other victories. Lance Armstrong has responded on his website, branding L'Equipes reporting of being ""nothing short of tabloid journalism."" Armstrong says: ""I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs."" The Châtenay-Malabry French national doping screening laboratory, which developed the first EPO tests, says it has been developing new experimental detection techniques and decided to test frozen urine samples taken from Armstrong after several stages of the 1999 tour. The director of the official French anti-doping test laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry, Jacques de Ceaurriz was quoted as saying he had ""no doubt about the validity of our results."" He said that while being kept for long periods can cause EPO proteins to deteriorate, this would possibly result in negative tests for doped athletes, but not false positives. It should be pointed out that technically this statement is false. EPO is naturally produced in the body. It is present at low levels in normal human urine, and natural levels in a human doing high-altitude training (a known ""trick"" of Mr. Armstrong) could be unusually high. Therefore, false positives can be obtained by setting the sensitivity threshold too low. This is especially true if the number of control samples (for calibration purposes) is limited, as is the case with the 1999 urine samples. These calibration issues are a reason EPO wasn't officially tested for earlier. Incidentally, de Ceaurriz stated that his laboratory worked on numbered anonymous samples, and was unaware when he sent his results to WADA/AMA that some of the results concerned Lance Armstrong. In addition to these accusations, and in response to them, Armstrong has also received open backing from US Cycling , individual cycling officials , from former Tour winners Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain , and other public figures. Supporters argue numerous irregularities in the doping claim: ""' Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) and the US Anti-Doping Agency, they've all defined a process for collecting samples, managing samples, testing the samples, identifying the people who are involved,' said Johnson. ' They have certain rights in the process. None of that has been followed in this case.' Officials from cycling's ruling body (UCI), Wada, the French sports ministry and the Tour de France all agree normal anti-doping proceedings have not been followed. ' This isn't a 'doping positive. This is just a publication in a French tabloid newspaper. That's our perspective,'"" added Johnson.'""--BBC These allegations are still under examination by a number of news and anti-doping organizations. *UCI Statement On September 9, after a period of investigation, the UCI finally released a strongly-worded official statement condemning the WADA, the French laboratory in question, and the paper L'Equipe, for having failed to provide any official communication, and having failed to provide any data, evidence, or background on the allegations. The UCI stated that it was still ""awaiting plausible answers"" to its requests to WADA and the laboratory, but also indicated ""We deplore the fact that the long-established and entrenched confidentiality principle could be violated in such a flagrant way without any respect for fair play and the rider's privacy."" The accusers themselves, in particular the World Anti-Doping Agency, might face an investigation into their own practices, in connection to their allegations against Armstrong. The UCI stated ""We have substantial concerns about the impact of this matter on the integrity of the overall drug testing regime of the Olympic movement, and in particular the questions it raises over the trustworthiness of some of the sports and political authorities active in the anti-doping fight."" On October 5, the UCI announced the appointment of an independent expert to investigate the leaking of doping allegations against Armstrong: ""French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims that samples given by the American icon on the 1999 Tour later tested positive. Armstrong has denied the allegations. The International Cycling Union (UCI) has now appointed Dutch lawyer and doping specialist Emile Vrijman to probe how the details were released. The UCI said it 'expects all relevant parties to fully co-operate'. Vrijman is a former director of the National Anti-Doping Agency in the Netherlands (NeCeDo)."""

Tied after eight ends, they went to extra ends which Norway won with 2 points. Outpacing other curlers on the ice, United States looked like they might be able to come back to tie things after their second end against Canada, and then only being down one after the fourth end, but Canada went on to score points in the next three ends. While Sweden won three of the seven ends they played against China, they were unable to beat the Chinese team who scored 2 points in two ends and 3 points in another end. In the fourth end, the 3 points came after a precision takeout by the Chinese skip Wang Haitao that cleared two Swedish stones off the sheet.

Russian skip Andrei Smirnov cleared a South Korean stone sitting in front of three Russian stones off the sheet that gave the Russians a two point lead. The United States has not medaled at the past two Paraympic Games, with their best finish a fourth at the 2010 Games. Of the United States's curling team, two are returning wheelchair curling Paralympic veterans. James Joseph, the second, competed at the 2006 Winter Paralympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics. The skip and Madison, Wisconsin native, Patrick McDonald, competed at the 2010 Games. Penny Greely, the lead, competed in sitting volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics where she won a bronze medal. David Palmer, the third, is competing at his first games after having a fourth place finish at the 2013 World Championships in Russia and a fifth place finish at the 2012 World Championships in South Korea. Alternate and Cape Cod native Meghan Lino is also at her first Paralympic Games after taking up the sport in 2009. Sweden's team has three team members who competed at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada: Jalle Jungnell, Glenn Ikonen, and Patrik Kallin. 60 year old Jungnell has the team's most Paralympic experience, having competed at the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Summer Paralympics in wheelchair basketball, as well as competing at the 2006 and 2010 Winter Paralympics in wheelchair curling. Finnish born Ikonen had been suspended for six months following the Vancouver Games following a positive doping test. He claimed metroprolol was a drug he had been using for 4 or 5 years, and was unhappy that his doctor prescribed the blood pressure reducing drug because he would not have intentionally taken a banned substance. The 2014 Games are the first Paralympics for Russia's wheelchair curling team. Alternate Oksana Slesarenko from Yekaterinburg and skip Andrei Smirnov also from Yekaterinburg have the most experience on the team, both having taken up the sport in 2003, and competing at the 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013 World Championships. Team Canada includes all five members of their 2013 World Championship winning team, including 63-year-old skip Jim Armstrong, 51-year-old Dennis John Thiessen, 52-year-old Ina Forrest, 47-year-old Sonja Gaudet, and 37-year-old Mark Ideson. Gaudet is the only wheelchair curling Paralympian with two gold medals, having won them in 2006 and 2010. Teammates Armstrong and Thiessen were part of the 2010 gold medal winning team. Gaudet also has gold medals from the 2009, 2011, and 2013 World Championships. While Armstrong was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1990 for his accomplishments in able bodied curling, Gaudet was the first wheelchair-only curler to be inducted when she was part of the 2013 class. South Korea has two returning 2010 Games silver medalists, Kang Mi-Suk and Kim Myung-Jin. Both originally played other sports before taking up curling. Kang played table tennis and Kim played wheelchair basketball.

Unlike able-bodied curling, players release the stone from a stationary position and there is no sweeping. Another curler often sits behind the stone thrower to hold their chair in place while they execute their throw. Unlike a number of other Paralympic sports, there is only one classification in wheelchair curling and a variety of lower body disabilities compete in the sport. South Koreans Kim Myung-Jin and Kim Jong-Pan, Swede Kristina Ulander, Team USA's Meghan Lino, Patrick McDonald, and David Palmer, and Russians Alexander Shevchenko, Svetlana Pakhomova, Oksana Slesarenko, Andrei Smirnov, and Marat Romanov have spinal cord injuries.

sport,"Major League Baseball player Manny Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers, has stated that he has been tested positive for a banned substance. As a result, he will be benched for 50 games. The baseball players' union stated, Ramirez said the positive test resulted from a medication prescribed by a doctor, and not from a steroid. Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension. Said Ramirez: ""Recently I saw a physician for a personal health issue. He gave me a medication, not a steroid, which he thought was okay to give me. Unfortunately, the medication was banned under our drug policy. Under the policy that mistake is now my responsibility. I have been advised not to say anything more for now. I do want to say one other thing; I've taken and passed about 15 drug tests over the past five seasons."" Ramirez is the biggest star player to test positive for drugs since Rafael Palmeiro, and the first major star to be suspended under baseball's stricter drug-testing rules. Ramirez is reported to lose at least 31% of his US$25-million salary as a result of the suspension. He will be allowed to resume playing baseball on July 3, 2009."

sport,"After lots of turns on the route of torch relay of 2008 Summer Olympics, Taiwan and China still insisted their own political positions. The IOC finally announced yesterday that the torch's route will not cross Taiwan. After the route was fixed by IOC, politicians and governments in Taiwan criticized China's behavior. One of Taiwan's 2008 presidential candidates, Ying-jiou Ma (former Taipei City Mayor), commented that without the torch, he can not welcome the torch with National Song and Flag of the Republic of China. Also, Chih-hsiung Huang (KMT Legislator) supposed that Mainland China and Democratic Progressive Party should be criticized on this fault. At the governmental level, Ming-tung Chen (Commissioner of Mainland Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China) mentioned that people in Taiwan do not accept the request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols, and the National Song of the Republic of China, based on the cross-strait common consensus on February 12, 2007. Chun-hsiung Chang (Premier of the Republic of China) hoped that this fault won't take effect on the tourism between China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Chih-Wei Hsieh (Minister of the Government Information Office of the Republic of China) was proud of the protection of democracy and human rights in Taiwan even though the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics won't come to Taiwan. According to Eastern Television in Taiwan, the reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked slowly, especially in such sporting events as: * Flag of the Republic of China was shown at Davis Cup in Taiwan at April, Cross-Strait Golf Championship and Asian Volleyball Championship at July. This was said to anger the Mainland China National Team. * Mainland China National Team withdrew the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championship and YONEX 2007 Chinese Taipei Badminton Open. * Ta Meng (Basketball Player of Jiangsu Nangang Team) deliberately elbowed Tai-Hao Wu at Cross-Strait Basketball Championship on September 4, 2007, and caused some spectators in Taiwan to protest Chinese Taipei Basketball Association and China by drawing Flags of the Republic of China. This Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor, even though IOC won't punish Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), but this indicates that the 2008 Summer Olympics may be more faded with politics than previously has occurred. The effects are indicated to be notable after Executive Yuan of Taiwan will promote the ""Torch of Joining UN"" in October 2007 and the ""Human Rights Torch Relay"" project by Taiwan newspaper Epoch Times in June 2008."

The most holy month in the Muslim calendar, which will take place from the 21 July to 20 August in 2012, involves fasting during daylight hours and will affect an estimated 3,000 athletes. Joanna Manning Cooper, spokesman for the games said: ""We did know about it when we submitted our bid and we have always believed that we could find ways to accommodate it."" Nevertheless, this will come as a huge embarrassment for the organisers who have tried to ensure the event involve all of Britain's ethnic communities. A quarter of the athletes who took part in the 2004 Athens Olympics were from predominantly Muslim countries and the fast will put any athletes involved at a clear disadvantage. The chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, Massoud Shadjared said: ""This is going to disadvantage the athletes and alienate the Asian communities by saying they don't matter. It's not only going to affect the participants, it's going to affect all the people who want to watch the games."" The president of the National Olympic Committee of Turkey, Togay Bayalti, said: ""This will be difficult for Muslim athletes. They don't have to observe Ramadan if they are doing sport and travelling but they will have to decide whether it is important to them.

""Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing crimes but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more to end the continuing human suffering there,"" Spielberg's statement said. ""China's economic, military and diplomatic ties to the government of Sudan continue to provide it with the opportunity and obligation to press for change."" China immediately expressed regret over his decision and suggested that ""ulterior motives"" may be at play. ""It is understandable if some people do not understand the Chinese government policy on Darfur, but I am afraid that some people may have ulterior motives, and this we cannot accept. ... China is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur. But empty rhetoric will not help. We hope that relevant people will be more pragmatic,"" said Liu Jianchao, the Deputy-Director General of the Information Department in China's foreign ministry. Following Spielberg's withdrawal, other organizations called for boycott of the Games. However, United Kingdom Minister for the Olympics Tessa Jowell rejected such calls. ""The world has known for the last seven years that Beijing would host the Olympics,"" Jowell told The Times. ""Most progressive governments accept that there are wholly unacceptable aspects of Chinese policy, but that did not stop the International Olympic Committee awarding them the games. A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity. This doesn't mean, however, we should be distracted from the urgency of Darfur."" ""China is also concerned about the humanitarian issues there, but we have been playing a positive and constructive role in promoting peace in Darfur,"" Liu said, adding that China is working with the United Nations to provide aid and resolve the crisis. Critics of China contend that China supports the Islamic regime in Sudan because it buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports and also sells it weapons. Further, China has been defending the government in Khartoum in the United Nations Security Council. Since 2003, fighting between government-backed militia and rebels in Darfur has led to the death of more than 200,000 people and displaced some 2.5 million others. Meanwhile, United States President George W. Bush confirmed that he still plans to attend the Games in Beijing. ""I view the Olympics as a sporting event. On the other hand, I have a different platform to Steven Spielberg, so I get to talk to Hu Jintao President of China and I do remind him he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur."" Bush followed this by saying: ""I’m not going to use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the Chinese people in a public way because I do it all the time with the president."""

Patrice Evra then had to be substituted for the Reds when he took a high challenge from Kazim-Richards, and was replaced by Keiron Richardson. Smith was then forced to change his shorts after being caught by Matthew Kilgallon. Luton Shelton continued to make an impact for Sheffield United as he blasted a shot just wide. After the break, Rooney again had a chance to double United's lead, but he was stopped by a well timed tackle from Chris Morgan. Shelton meanwhile caused unrest in the Man United defence with strong runs, but no goals came of them. Rooney finally scored his goal on 5 minutes when his run was met by Ryan Giggs' pass, and the young Englishman blasted the ball far side on Kenny. Shelton again threatened as he turned away from Wes Brown, but he then scooped the ball over the bar. Danny Webber then had a chance for the Blades after beating out Heinze, but he raked his shot wide. Kenny was then forced into action to make saves off both Ronaldo and Rooney, to keep the game at a respectable scoreline. Shelton then had a legitimate claim for a penalty when he was brought down by Heinze in the area, but referee Rob Styles waved play on. The decision all but ended the Blades hopes of a comeback, but they still continued to press as Tonge hit the post with a curling shot. Kuszczak kept his clean sheat, however, and the Red Devils earned a valuable three points in the title race. Manchester United's next match will be another Premiership game against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford. Sheffield United's next, also in the Premiership, will be against main relegation rivals Charlton Athletic, and that match will be very important for both teams."

In a match that contained thirteen shots on goal, neither team could find the back of the net, and so to penalties it went. Barry Ferguson missed the opening spot-kick, seeing it saved by Sebastien Frey. Zdravko Kuzmanovic put the home side ahead. Steven Whittaker succeeded where his captain could not, slotting the ball home. Riccardo Montolivo maintained Fiorentina's lead before Sasa Papac put away Rangers' second. Fabio Liverani was next up, and his effort was saved by Neil Alexander. The shootout was now level, with one miss apiece.

sport,"Carlos Delgado was impressive in his National League debut with the Florida Marlins on Tuesday after getting off to a slow start. In the first inning, the Marlins scored five runs off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz, while Delgado struck out on three pitches. Delgado made up for this disappointment by following it with four straight hits, hitting four-for-five with three RBIs en route to a 9-0 victory. Before the start of the season, there was some concern about how the change from American to National League would affect the slugger's performance. Delgado spent the past thirteen seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays before signing a four-year, $52 million contract with the Marlins. Marlins manager Jack McKeon said, wryly, ""Many of the writers asked during spring training if his change of leagues was going to be a factor. In the first inning, it was."" Delgado has certainly made an impact on the Marlins organization, and there is a lot of excitement in Miami over his new arrival. Opening day attendance was a record sell-out at Dolphins Stadium of 57,405, and spirits are high as the Marlins are one of the favourites to win the National League East, thanks in no small part to Delgado's presence. But, the baseball season is a long road to travel; as Delgado said, ""Obviously, we have good talent here. We've got to go out and play.

sport,"The race in the AL East is alive and well. The New York Yankees mounted a comeback from an early 4-0 deficit to beat the Boston Red Sox, 8-6, last night, and reduce the Sox' AL East division lead to a mere 1.5 games. The key was the Yankees' hot bats. The Bronx Bombers hit 4 homeruns in total, the last one a thunderous 2-run blast by Alex Rodriguez off converted Red Sox starter Curt Schilling, who was in his first appearance as a relief pitcher after his rehab stint in the minors. Boston jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead against Yankees starter Mike Mussina, establishing the sort of lead that would usually cause the Yankees to fold during the first half of the season. However, the torrid hitting of the Yankee lineup over the last two weeks would not allow that. Mussina adjusted to the tight strike zone as the game progressed, allowing just one run over the next five innings, and the Yankees chipped away at the BoSox' lead. Bernie Williams, Jason Giambi, and Gary Sheffield all hit solo shots off Red Sox starter Bronson Arroyo. At the end of the sixth inning the score was tied, 5-5, and both starters were done for the day. The game would come down to relief pitching. David Ortiz put the Red Sox ahead in the bottom of the seventh, hitting a bases-empty home run off Tanyon Sturtze to push the score to 6-5. The Yankees rebounded in the top half of the eighth when Ruben Sierra, pinch-hitting for rookie CF Melky Cabrera, connected for a double, tying the game at 6-all. Schilling came on in the top of the ninth and promptly hung a 2-2 splitter over the plate for Gary Sheffield, who lined a double off the wall in left-center. Rodriguez was up next, and hit another splitter that never split. The two-run homer gave the Yankees their first lead of the game. Mariano Rivera came on in the bottom of the ninth and silenced the Red Sox bats by striking out the side to end the game, recording his 21st save. Boston has lost three straight games and is now 10 games over .500 at 49-39. The Yankees (47-40) have won 8 of 9 games dating back to before the All-Star break and currently sit in 3rd place, half a game behind 2nd-place Baltimore. Notes: Rookie Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, who has been one of the Yankees' most consistent performers, has been placed on the 15-day DL with a shoulder injury. It has been speculated that Wang, who tore his labrum while in the minors, may be out for the season. Wang was slated to start tonight's game, but will be replaced by Tim Redding as he waits for an appointment with Dr. James Andrews on Monday...Former Red Sox manager Joe Kerrigan has been signed by the Yankees as an advance scout.

tech,"The People's Republic of China has announced the completion of an enormous dam across the Yangtze River, an important milestone for the world's largest hydroelectric project. The official Xinhua News Agency reports the event as a ""landmark in the construction of the project."" Launched in 1993, the Three Gorges Project, including the 2,300 metre long, 185 metre high dam with 26 power generators, is being built in three phases on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River - China's longest river. Built with over 16 million m3 of concrete, the Three Gorges Dam is considered the biggest reinforced concrete dam in the world. The Three Gorges Reservoir is capable of holding nearly 40 billion m3 of water, including a space of 22.15 billion m3 for extra flooded water. With a length of more than 6,300 km and a natural fall of 5,400 metres from the west to the east, the flood-prone Yangtze River is the third largest in the world. The gigantic project is expected to generate around 15 million megawatts of electricity, 84.7 billion kWh annually when the entire project is completed in 2008. But whilst proponents of the world's largest hydropower project laud the increased electricity generation and improved flood control as benefits to China, opponents claim destruction of the environment, ruin to China's cultural heritage - disaffecting millions of local residents. ""In my view, building the Three Gorges dam is a ridiculous and evil farce,"" says dam opponent Dai Qing. ""Many people have known something is wrong with the project, but few have dared to speak up,"" she said. After it becomes operational, the 660km reservoir created by the dam will drown 13 towns, 4500 villages and 162 archaeological sites. Friends of the Earth (FoE) are also strident vocal critics. ""The dam is having a titanic social and environment impact,"" the group said this week. ""Sometimes people are being moved out by truncheon and bulldozer because they refuse to leave their home for fear of not being rehoused. Human rights violations are massive and brutal,"" it said. FoE pointed to evidence that the dam was already having a serious environment impact. FoE points to a scientific study by the East China Normal University in Shanghai, published in March in Geophysical Research, which said that in 2004, the Three Gorges dam has reduced the supply of sediment to the Yangtze delta to just 35 per cent of the norm. Millions of tonnes of silt are drawn along the Yangtze river every year, and critics argue the dam will intercept much of it - with potentially disastrous consequences. They say the lack of sediment further downstream would lead to soil erosion, and the accumulation of sediment in the reservoir could raise the dam level, submerging even more land. Opponents say the reservoir could fill with the accumulated garbage from tens of millions of households. The China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp. has spent $2.5 million on a vessel to collect as much as 7 million cubic feet of garbage that accumulates at the dam each year, according to Xinhua. Some argue that the impact of the dam project will contribute to the extinction of the rare Yangtze river dolphin. The dam project will force the relocation of a total of 1.13 million people, and communities that have lived in the area for millennia will disappear. Researchers warn sedimentation and rising water levels in the reservoir will lead to the evacuation of tens of thousands more people. But as the waters rise, that which can not be saved will disappear along with some world famous natural scenery. Critics say the dam is under threat from earthquakes, with two geological fault lines nearby. Officials working on the project counter this by saying the worst that can happen is a tremor measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, while the dam is built to withstand force 7.0. ""Although the dam is now complete, we still have a long way to go and cannot become self-satisfied or relax our efforts in the least,"" Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Project Development Corp, said. The official China Daily in an editorial called for people to remember the more than 100 workers whom died during the dam's construction. ""The best possible way to repay such a debt of gratitude is to make sure the highest safety and quality standards are observed up till the very end of the entire building process,"" the editorial said."

tech,"A group of 41 paleontologists and researchers reaffirmed the cause of dinosaur extinction. The research team concluded that a giant asteroid killed dinosaurs over 65 million years ago. The asteroid crashed into Yucatán, Mexico creating the Chicxulub crater. Their report was published Friday in the academic journal Science. In 1980, Louis Alvarez and son, Walter, had published a paper stating that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs. The Chicxulub crater was also discovered in Mexico at approximately that same time, therefore the theory gained scientific acceptance. More recent explanations of the cause of dinosaur's extinction included that perhaps volcanic eruptions on Deccan traps or multiple asteroid crashes ended the dinosaurs' existence. The team performed chemical analyses of soil and fossil samples, where a high concentration of iridium (which is commonly found in asteroids and meteors) was found, which dated back to the approximate time of the asteroid crash. The asteroid measured approximately 7.5 miles wide, and hit with an impact of one billion times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The impact would have immediately killed all animals and plant life within the radius of half of a continent. With such an impact, debris would have flown into the air and then fallen back into the atmosphere with the force of a ballistic missile. The crash of this asteroid into the earth would have also caused the equivalent of the heat of ten noonday suns, which would have burned the skin or feathers of dinosaurs, and created wildfires on any plant life which had survived to that point. The crash would have also triggered massive earthquakes and tsunamis, possibly causing parts of continents to fall into the ocean. The area of Yucatán which the asteroid struck had also been rich in sulfur, which was blasted out of the earth and into the sky, where it would have mixed with water vapors, creating clouds that rained sulfuric acid, and which would block out the sun for approximately a decade.

tech,"Recent scans on the planet Saturn by the space probe Cassini–Huygens have shown that the planet's rings are much older than previously thought. Recent data says they may be as old as the solar system itself. The new scans have indicated that the rings are likely three to five billion years old, and will probably be around for billions of years longer. Scientists previously thought the rings to be only about 100 million years old. ""Despite what was thought after the 1970s Voyager investigations of Saturn - that Saturn's rings might be very youthful, perhaps only as ancient as the dinosaurs - we have results that show the rings could have lasted as long as the Solar System and maybe will be around for billions of years. Recycling allows the rings to be as old as the solar system although continually changing,"" said researcher Professor Larry Esposito. The determination was made when Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) analyzed the light from the Sun reflecting off particles in the rings of all different sizes. The data had shown that there was a lot more clumpy material and as much as three times more mass than what was previously found in the Voyager missions. Scientists assumed that particles from an exploding comet may have caused the rings to form, but the new data says that it is unlikely to be the case, because the particles are all of different ages. ""Although the Voyager observations indicated Saturn's rings were youthful, Cassini shows even younger ages; and because we see such transient, dynamic phenomena in the rings we are able to reach the paradoxical conclusion - because the rings appear so young, they may actually be as old as the Solar System,"" added Esposito. Cassini is operated jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency."
tech,"A Norwegian University of Science and Technology study released Thursday found electric vehicles have a potential for higher eco-toxicity and greenhouse impact than conventional cars. The study includes an examination of the electric car's life cycle as a whole rather than a study of the electric car's environmental impact during the use phase. The researchers conducted a comparison of the environmental impact of electric cars in view of different ratios of green-to-fuel electricity energy sources. In the case of mostly coal- or oil-based electricity supply, electric cars are disadvantageous compared to classic diesel cars with the greenhouse effect impact being up to two times larger. The researchers found that in Europe, electric cars pose a ""10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles"". The researchers suggest to improve eco-friendliness of electric vehicles by ""reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure"" and using the electric cars for a longer time, so that the use phase plays a more important role in the electric vehicle life cycle."

Reports of senior directors receiving million-pound bonuses, and former Labour minister Patricia Hewitt landing over over £50,000 extra per-year, are characterised as ""directors' 'snouts in the trough'"". Hewitt was suspended from her parliamentary party in March over cash-for-access accusations, and works two to three days each month on BT's remuneration committee. The UK's Press Association described the now-rejected offer as being worth 2% this year, and an additional 3% in 2011 with staff bonuses of up to £250. The package supposedly contains pledges on no compulsory redundancies and the return of call centre and non-frontline work from outsource companies in India. Should BT staff strike over a sub-inflation rise when the company is paying shareholder dividends? Wikinews called both the Communication Workers' Union, and British Telecom, seeking clarification on a number of points. Richard Knowles, a BT press officer in London, forwarded their terse sub-400-word statement, refusing to be drawn on reports that the offer includes the repatriation of call centre and back-office jobs. When challenged on this work being carried out in a jurisdiction with less-stringent data protection, and computer misuse legislation, our reporter was referred back to the company's statement. Sian Jones of the CWU's Press Office, commenting prior to the union's evening statement, remarked that repatriation of call centre work was an issue that the union had prior, unrelated, discussions with BT about; she gave no indication to Wikinews this was, or was not, part of BT's revised offer. The press release, shortly after 1630 BST, expressed clear intent to carry on with the process of balloting members on strike action. In the statement, CWU DGS Andy Kerr states, ""we're very disappointed that BT's revised offer remains materially unchanged for this year in terms of pay."" Continuing, he emphasised, ""... we've made clear, 2 per cent is unacceptable for our members as it does not reflect the reward they expect given the contribution they have made to cost savings of £1.75 billion and profits of over £1bn. In addition, inflation is at 5.3 per cent and staff are comparing this offer with the large salary rises and bonuses for senior executives which expose the blatant double standards being adopted by the company when it comes to remuneration."" The CWU statement also expresses concern over BT's disclosure of details within the offer; ""BT's decision to leak their offer to the media today has also raised trust issues for us with the company."" Any sustained action by CWU members in BT's employ could have a major impact on the country's communication infrastructure. Millions of UK households and businesses are reliant on BT for internet access &amp;ndash; in addition to telephony services. Following the release of their statement, the CWU's Sian Jones confirmed that the union had not, as-yet, given BT the formal seven-days notice of balloting members on strike action. Any ballot would run for a two-week period; following such, the union would, again, be required to give seven days notice to BT; this time of their intent to take workers out on strike. She emphasised, ""nobody wants to be on strike"", stressing that the union last took such action in 1987, and would prefer round-table discussions and an improved offer. The structure of BT's privatisation, and breakup to permit level playing-field telephony and broadband competition, would see other Internet service providers who rely on the ageing, once GPO-owned, copper POTS infrastructure unable to resolve customer faults. According to the CWU, BT has been querying managerial staff on their skillsets &amp;ndash; as a form of preparation for any industrial action. A union spokesperson described this as ""laughable"". When called for comment on the union's rejection of their revised offer, the BT press office declined to comment at this time."
tech,"On Sunday, NASA announced on twitter its man-made helicopter Ingenuity survived its first freezing night on the surface of Mars. Ingenuity is a part of Perseverances mission, which primarily focuses on astrobiology, and Ingenuity is planned to fly and explore Mars and gather rocks samples looking for signs of life. Ingenuity has previously been in the belly of Perseverance, a car-sized rover which landed on Mars' Jezero Crater on February 18. Perseverance charged Ingenuity and kept it warm. Ingenuity left the rover on Sunday, after which the rover moved away to expose Ingenuity's photovoltaic array to direct sunlight. The NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory released a statement saying this was the first time Ingenuity survived the night by itself while being exposed to the planet atmosphere directly. In the statement NASA wrote this has confirmed they have ""the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a big win for the team."" The temperatures could go as low as -90 °C (-130 °F), the statement said. The helicopter used the energy from its solar array to power a small heater and protect its electronics from the cold. Mars just has 1% of atmosphere as compared to Earth. Ingenuity's propeller had to rotate about three times faster for flight on the Martian atmosphere as compared to flying on Earth, ABC News reported. Ingenuity has been designed to be light to make the takeoff easier. Its mass is about 1.8 kilograms. Tim Canham from NASA said ""The processor on the helicopter is about 100 times more powerful than the processor on the rover itself"". The next step would be a blade movement test scheduled for today, CNN said. If successful, it would be followed by first flight test, which can take place by Sunday. That would be the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. Five flights were expected to occur in the next 31 days. If successful, they would be followed by further movement of the helicopter, as it would collect samples of rocks, and collect photos of its observations. Throughout the entire duration of research, Ingenuity would also measure its temperatures and battery recharge performance. Perseverance rover is to deliver images from Ingenuity to Earth, reportedly a few hours after they were captured. NASA said the rover travelled a distance of 471 million km to reach the crater. clear"
tech,"In an internet-based study published today on the website of the British Medical Journal, Australian investigators tested how well Googling could help to establish a difficult diagnosis. The search results met against their criteria in 15 out of 26 cases. Previous anecdotes of the use of Google in reaching a difficult diagnosis are presented in the paper. In a case described in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), a physician diagnosed IPEX syndrome after submitting the typical diagnostic clues to the search engine. A patient's father replied to doctor's saying that his son had acute subclavian vein thrombosis of unknown origin: ""But of course he has Paget-von Schrötter syndrome."" Hangwi Tang and Jennifer Hwee Kwoon Ng from the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane selected clinical cases from the NEJM blind to the correct diagnosis. They selected 3 to 5 rather specific features, searched Google, and selected the 3 disorders from the results that seemed to fit the case best. If one of those was right, Google was said to be ""right"". The scientists admit that an internet search probably works better with specific symptoms rather than with phrases such as ""fever ill pain"". Also, the percentage may depend on the operating physician's knowledge base, and the test was not double-blind. Experts commented that the internet is not a replacement for doctors, but should be seen as a way of supporting doctors and patients. A spokeswoman for the Patient Association added that ""a lot of sites are not credible. There are lots of good sites out there, but we also know that there are many that are not credible."""
tech,"Internet On February 4, 2009 in an attempt to keep MySpace safe for young users, MySpace officials stated that they have removed 90,000 sex offender accounts from their website. The social networking site admitted this is double what they anticipated last year. MySpace previously thought the site had 40,000 offender accounts registered. North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper and Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal stated that they encourage and seek more social networking sites like MySpace to become safer. After the MySpace team calculated the number of sex offenders on their website they submitted the numbers to both attorneys on Tuesday February 3. ""This shocking revelation, resulting from our subpoena, provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain rife with sexual predators,"" said Blumenthal. Both attorneys work with Facebook and MySpace in an agreement to make their social networking websites safer, especially for young users. They have already made both websites safer by implementing dozens of safeguards and a special features where users older than the age of 18 have limitations searching users less than 18 years of age."
tech,"On Jan. 17, the NASA-led Swift satellite mission detected and imaged its first gamma-ray burst, one of the most powerful explosions to occur in the universe. The burst was in the midst of exploding as Swift, designed to autonomously repoint itself, turned and focused in less than 200 seconds on the event. The satellite was fast enough to capture an image with its X-Ray Telescope (XRT), while gamma rays were still being detected with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). ""This is the first time an X-ray telescope has imaged a gamma-ray burst while it was bursting,"" said Dr. Neil Gehrels, Swift's principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. ""Most bursts are gone in about ten seconds, and few last upwards of a minute. Previous X-ray images have captured the burst afterglow, not the burst itself."" ""This is the one that didn't get away,"" said Prof. John Nousek, Swift's mission operations director at Penn State University, in State College, PA. ""And this is what Swift was built to do: to detect these fleeting gamma-ray bursts and focus its telescopes on them autonomously within about a minute. The most exciting thing is this mission is just revving up."" Swift has three main instruments. The BAT detects bursts and initiates the autonomous slewing to bring the XRT and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) within focus of the burst. In December, the BAT started detecting bursts, including a remarkable triple detection on Dec. 19. Today's announcement marks the first BAT detection autonomously followed by XRT detection, demonstrating the satellite is swiftly slewing as planned. The UVOT is still being tested, and it was not collecting data when the burst was detected. Scientists expect Swift to be fully operational by Feb. 1. ""We are frantically analyzing the XRT data to understand the X-ray emission seen during the initial explosion and the very early afterglow,"" said Dr. David Burrows, the XRT lead at Penn State. ""This is a whole new ballgame. No one has ever imaged X-rays during the transition of a gamma-ray burst from the brilliant flash to the fading embers."" The origin of gamma-ray bursts remains a mystery. At least some appear to originate in massive star explosions. Others might be the result of merging black holes or neutron stars. Any of these scenarios likely will result in the formation of a new black hole. The Swift satellite's two-year mission will be to: *Determine the origin of gamma-ray bursts. *Classify gamma-ray bursts and search for new types. *Determine how the explosion develops. *Use gamma-ray bursts to study the early universe. *Perform the first sensitive hard X-ray survey of the sky. Swift, still in its checkout phase, is an international collaboration launched on Nov. 20, 2004. It is a NASA mission in partnership with the Italian Space Agency and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, United Kingdom."

tech,"This is a map, by Mario Juric of Princeton University based upon the forthcoming SDSS-II Data Release 5, of the Virgo super star cluster, viewed from far away and from above the galactic plane. It shows the counts of faint blue stars, from a narrow magnitude and color range, that are 10 kiloparsec away from Earth. The map is shown in the Lambert projection of galactic coordinates: radial rays are lines of constant longitude, circles are lines of constant latitude, the North Galactic Pole is in the center, and the Galactic Centre is towards the left. The counts are shown on a logarithmic stretch, with a dynamic range of 10 increasing from blue to red. The dotted line through the middle of the map shows the plane of the debris from the Saggitarius dwarf galaxy that is being cannibalized by the Milky Way. This debris is approximately four times further away from Earth than the Virgo super star cluster is. Astronomers have hypothesised that the two may be related. Astronomers at Sloan Digital Sky Survey have announced the discovery of a huge star cluster, the Virgo super star cluster 10 kiloparsecs (32,600 light years) away from the solar system (roughly the same distance as the galactic centre), in the constellation of Virgo. Many of the stars have been known to astronomers for centuries, but only now have they realized the existence of the cluster. In a presentation to the American Astronomical Society, Princeton University graduate student Mario Juric, the principal author of the findings, explained: ""Some of the stars in this Milky Way companion have been seen with telescopes for centuries, but because the galaxy is so close, its stars are spread over a huge swath of the sky, and they always used to be lost in the sea of more numerous Milky Way stars. This galaxy is so big, we couldn't see it before."" The large overpopulation of stars was discovered by researchers analyzing SDSS-I and SDSS-II data. SDSS has, to date, imaged roughly one-quarter of the northern sky. The method used was the photometric parallax method. ""We used the SDSS data to measure distances to 48 million stars and build a 3-d map of the Milky Way."" explained Zeljko Ivezic of the University of Washington, a co-author of the study. This discovery is one in a series of such discoveries made within the last decade by a new generation of sky surveys. The Saggitarius dwarf galaxy was discovered in 1994 using photographic sky images. Since then, analysis of photographs by large digital cameras has identified several streams and clumps of stars, some of which (astronomers believe) are Milky Way companions and others of which are shreds of the Saggitarius dwarf or other dwarf galaxies that are also dissolving into the Milky Way. An earlier SDSS discovery was the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. ""With so much irregular structure in the outer Galaxy, it looks as though the Milky Way is still growing, by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that fall into it,"" said Juric. The first indication that the Virgo super star cluster existed was in 2001, when the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) survey, using a 1-metre telescope in Llano del Hato National Astronomical Observatory in Venezuela, found a clump of five RR Lyrae variable stars, which astronomers speculated might belong to a small galaxy being canibalized by the Milky Way. Kathy Vivas of the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia in Venezuela, the author of the QUEST paper on the discovery, commented that ""In light of the new SDSS results, it appears that the stellar stream we detected is itself part of the larger structure identified by Juric and collaborators."" In a letter to the Astrophysical Journal the QUEST has presented further evidence for Vivas' interpretation, by measuring the motions and chemical compositions of stars in the region."
tech,"Strasbourg. The European Parliament has rejected the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (software patent directive) sustained by lobbies of large software publicists such as the corporations Microsoft, Siemens, Nokia and Alcatel, grouped under the title of the European Information &amp; Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA, ). The directive involved the granting of software patents. 648 MEPs out of 680 rejected the text, 18 voted for and 14 abstained. A rejection vote became the expected outcome when the European People's Party, initially in favour of the directive, decided to reject it. The European Greens, Socialist Group and European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party also voted for rejection of the directive for heterogeneous reason. Michel Rocard, author of a number of amendments to the original directive, said that the majority of the modifications were unlikely to be supported by the Commission and Council, with whom the Parliament would have had to enter a Conciliation procedure if it had voted for maintaining the directive in moditifed form. ""Better have no text at all than a bad one"", he added. Before the vote, Rocard pointed at the irritation of the Parliament towards the Commission: ""There is collective anger throughout the Parliament because of the way the directive was handled by the Commission and the Council"". During the debate on Tuesday, Commissioner Joaquín Almunia told MEPs: ""Should you decide to reject the common position, the Commission will not submit a new proposal."". The rejection was welcomed by small and medium software companies, as well as by Free Software supporters. The Directive had been subject to an intense campaigning, within the Parliament, in the news media and on the Internet. The supporters of the Council position appear to have spent several ten millions, hiring prestigious PR agencies with at least 30-40 lobbyists who roamed the halls of the Parliament every day for 3 months, and many full-page advertisements in EU newspapers such as European Voice, EU Reporter etc. The opponents of software patentability (that is supporters of the position taken by the European Parliament in its 1st reading of 24 September 2003), coordinated under the roof of the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), also had several lobbyists stationed in Brussels, conducted several conferences and demonstrations and published some newspaper advertisements, with a total budget of nearly 100,000 eur apart from countless unpaid working hours of a dedicated supporter base, consisting mainly of programmers and software entrepreneurs."
tech,"Space Spacebabe China launched its second unmanned lunar exploration probe, Chang'e 2, on Friday from the province of Sichuan. Chang'e 2 is part of a Chinese initiative to test skills and technology that could lead to unmanned landings in the future. The head of the orbiter's design team was quoted by Xinhua as saying: ""Chang'e 2 lays foundation for the soft-landing on the moon and further exploration of outer space. It (will) travel faster and closer to the moon, and it will capture clear pictures."" Launched in 2007, the preceding unmanned Chang'e 1 mission took around thirteen days to reach lunar orbit. Chang'e 2 is expected to take around five. Once Chang'e 2 arrives at the moon, it is planned that the probe will be put into an orbit less than 100 kilometers from the surface as opposed to the 200 kilometer orbit of the previous Chang'e 1. The probe will then be put into a 15 kilometer orbit to survey possible landing sites for the unmanned Chang'e 3 mission."
tech,"InternetHuman brains cannot manage more than 150 friendships &amp;ndash; even with the advent of social networking websites like Facebook, Bebo and Myspace. This is the conclusion of Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Dunbar originally carried out research in this area in the 1990s, looking at social groups from modern offices back to ancient villages. He found that the neocortex in the brain, used for thinking and language, cannot cope with more than 150 friends &amp;ndash; a conclusion known as ""Dunbar's number"". Groups of people tend to be limited to about 150 as, beyond that, social cohesion suffers. Revisiting the topic, Dunbar's view is that this number has not increased even with online methods of keeping in touch with friends, like Facebook. Dunbar compared the online activity of those with thousands of internet friends and those with hundreds, before concluding that there was no appreciable difference in their levels of activity. He defined a friend as someone that the individual cared about and made contact with at least yearly. ""The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world. ... People obviously like the kudos of having hundreds of friends but the reality is that they’re unlikely to be bigger than anyone else’s"", he observed. Another conclusion of his study was that women were better at keeping friendships going on Facebook than men &amp;ndash; ""girls are much better at maintaining relationships just by talking to each other. Boys need to do physical stuff together"". The full results of his study are due to be published later in 2010. Dunbar, 52, has been an Oxford professor since 2007, having previously been Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Liverpool. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford."
tech,"Popular social networking website Facebook went down for unknown upgrades, possibly to circumvent multiple holes that were published in a white paper earlier. From roughly 1:00 to 4:15 pm ET, users reported the site was down. Blogs have speculated it may be simply a server upgrade, or it may be new features. One web development blogger has even raised the theory that the site was hacked, with the login box showing multiple random email addresses, through """" coding. Another user replied to this posting, saying that they were even able to read the other, random user's inbox. Both a blogger who works at a computing company's office in Johannesburg, South Africa and a Norwegian news outlet reported similar troubles. Many blogs received comments from people with similar circumstances, worldwide. A white paper by Adrienne Felt, posted on July 27, 2007, explained step-by-step how to use an exploit to hijack a user's account. The white paper was then partially censored by the author, until the vulnerability has been fixed by Facebook. Regardless of whether the change was prompted by this paper, both the XSS hole and problem with forms described by the author were fixed during the upgrade. The site read ""We're upgrading. We'll be back soon."" with no further explanation. This is the first known global outage for the site. This comes as a rival site, ConnectU, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea and the code. The hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.

tech,"A Lockheed-Martin built Atlas V launch vehicle, successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 21:42 UTC (4:42 p.m. EST). It placed the Inmarsat 4 F-1 communications satellite into orbit. This was Lockheed-Martin's second try to launch the satellite. Yesterday's attempt ended in a scrub when the flight control computer passed a red-line with less than three minutes remaining in the countdown. This was the fifth launch of the Atlas V vehicle, and the first launch where the rocket used three of the first stage, Aerojet built, solid rocket motors. It also had the narrower 4 meter payload fairing. For the first part of the flight, the rocket was powered by a common booster core with two RD-180 rocket engines plus three solid rocket motors. When their fuel was expended the solid rocket motors burned out and were jettisoned. The common booster core then continued pushing the payload and upper stage, with its two RD-180 engines producing 806,000lbf of thrust. The common booster core expended its fuel around four and a half minutes into the flight. At this point the first stage common booster core separated from the upper stage and payload. After the stage separation, the Centaur upper stage started its engine and burned for nearly ten minutes. During this burn, the payload fairing separated from the spacecraft, leaving the satellite exposed on the nose of the rocket in the vacuum of space. When the ten minute burn was up, the Centaur coasted with the satellite for another ten minutes waiting to get to the optimal point for the final burn. At around 24 minutes into the flight, the final burn of the Centaur stage occurred, placing the spacecraft in a super-synchronous transfer orbit. After this burn was complete, the Centaur separated, leaving the spacecraft on its own. Now the spacecraft must attempt to open its solar arrays and place itself in the final geostationary orbit. Because of this special type of orbit, where the spacecraft goes around once every 24 hours, the satellite will appear to sit in one place over the equator. From this location, Inmarsat will use it to provide BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) which is a 3G compatible, 432kbit/s data service, to much of the world. The Atlas vehicle was rolled out of its vertical integration facility 1800 feet from the launch pad early yesterday morning (before the first launch attempt). The reason for this launch day move is because of the clean pad concept. Past American rockets (with the exception of the Saturns and Space Shuttles) have always been assembled on the launch pad. In the case of a delay in launching, this would cause delays in all the rockets that needed to be launched after the one that experienced the delay. With the new clean pad concept, rockets can be assembled and checked out before being moved to the pad, saving delays in the schedule. The launch tower and rocket move out to the pad along a set of railroad tracks, making the 1800 foot journey in approximately half an hour, topping out around two miles per hour. Because of the clean pad concept, none of the launch control electronics or spacecraft environmental systems are on the pad. Instead, they are run along the railroad tracks with the rocket as it moves to the pad on launch day. When they get there, they slide into concrete enclosures so that they are not destroyed during the rocket launch."

tech,"Internet The popular social networking site Facebook agreed to purchase the Instagram photo-sharing mobile app for US$1 billion in cash and stock Monday. The app, which can be used to apply faux-vintage filters to photographs, allows users to share photos with one another both directly and through posts to social networking sites. Instagram was founded less than two years ago by two Stanford University graduates near San Francisco, California and the purchase is one of the largest acquisitions in Facebook history following after a failed takeover bid in early 2011 which had been declined by Instagram. Facebook, despite its prominence as the largest website for social networking in the world, has had difficulties expanding into the mobile market, particularly the realm of mobile advertising. As of yet, Facebook lacks an advertising platform for its apps and has yet to capitalize off the boom in mobile phone use that Instagram is intertwined with. 4=Mark Zuckerberg Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg noted the importance of the ability to post to multiple social media sites at once in a post. He wrote on his personal timeline, ""We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is an important part of the experience."" He said Facebook ""plans on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on Facebook."" Many other small services that Facebook has acquired, namely Gowalla, Hot Potato, and FriendFeed, were all shuttered shortly after acquisition. The co-founder of Instagram, Kevin Systrom, in a company blog post, has denied any claims that Instagram would share the fate of these past services. ""It’s important to be clear that Instagram is not going away. We’ll be working with Facebook to evolve Instagram and build the network. We’ll continue to add new features to the product and find new ways to create a better mobile photos experience,"" he wrote. Many reasons have been put forth for the purchase, and Zuckerberg commented, ""for years, we've focused on building the best experience for sharing photos with your friends and family. Now, we'll be able to work even more closely with the Instagram team to also offer the best experiences for sharing beautiful mobile photos with people based on your interests."""

Notable accomplishments included replacing critical hardware in the Joint Quest Airlock; repairing U.S. spacesuits; and submitting a scientific research paper on ultrasound use in space. Chiao was also the first astronaut to vote in the U.S. Presidential election from space. The crew completed two spacewalks, including experiment installation and tasks to prepare the Station for the arrival of the new European Automated Transfer Vehicle next year. Aboard the Station, Commander Sergei Krikalev and Flight Engineer and NASA Station Science Officer John Phillips, the Expedition 11 crew, are beginning a six-month mission. It will include the resumption of Space Shuttle flights and two spacewalks from the Station. Expedition 11 is scheduled to return to Earth on October 7, 2005. The two latest occupants of the station launched with Vittori from Baikonur April 14. Krikalev and Phillips will have light duty for the next two days, as they rest after completing a busy handover period. For the past week, they have been learning about Station operations from the two men who called the ship home since October. Chiao and Sharipov briefed Krikalev and Phillips on day-to-day operations and gave them hands-on opportunities at Station maintenance. Chiao and Phillips restored the Quest airlock to working order for future spacewalks and practiced operating the Canadarm2 robotic arm."
tech,"Internet The United States announced the declassification of a portion of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a major part of the US's efforts to thwart cyber warfare, on Tuesday. The announcement came at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, and was given by Howard Schmidt, who is the current US cyber-security coordinator, having been assigned the position in December. While only a portion of the document was revealed at the announcement, and much remains classified material, including all material related to plans by the government for offensive cyber-warfare, the program has twelve parts, and has three main strategies: *To create a defensive mechanism against immediate threats, as well as those possible in the near future; *To create a defensive mechanism against a wide variety of threats, both present and future; *To initiate efforts to strengthen future cyber-security efforts. The program includes funding for numerous security measures, including the government's controversial Einstein program, which scans all incoming communications to government-operated websites. The plan also mentions increasing security for classified networks within the government, as well as developing a government-wide plan for counter-intelligence work, although the declassified portions gave little indication as to what that would involve. The program was begun by President George Bush in 2008 as a National Security Presidential Directive, and has been entirely classified until now. At its inception, it was intended to serve as a program to unify cyber-security efforts within the government and to develop other security programs for use nationwide. No budget has been released for the program, although estimates place the cost at $40 billion until 2015."
tech,"Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the San Jose, California-based joint venture of Japanese storage vendor Hitachi and U.S. technology giant IBM, has set a new record for storage density at 230 gigabits per square inch (Gb/in2). The company has developed technology to implement a recording method known as perpendicular recording, which allowed the increase in density above the current ~130 Gb/in2 limit. Techworld claims there is a race between Hitachi and Toshiba for who will get the first drives to market which use the technology. According to Hitachi, they expect, ""to ship their first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive"". Toshiba is also planning to ship a drive in 2005 that uses perpendicular recording. According to Techworld, Toshiba will ship an 80 GB, 1.8"" drive in 2005. Toshiba's 1.8"" drives are used in portable electronic devices such as Apple's iPod, which is currently available in sizes 60 GB and smaller. While all commercially available hard drives to date use longitudinal recording, perpendicular recording has roots in research done in academic circles over 100 years ago. Hitachi Tech has produced a Flash animation that explains the rudiments of perpendicular recording in a music-video style. Inspired by the 1970s Schoolhouse Rock series of educational animation shorts, the flash movie features whimsical moments with data bits and disk platters that speak and sing (not possible with today's technology), it also contains realistic details. Of no importance to the viewer, but perhaps of interest to some, the animation shows Texas Instruments' UC5608DWP chips visible briefly in the background. While TI's UC5608DWP 18-line SCSI terminator chips have been made obsolete by the new UCC5618, the chips are indeed designed for use in hard drives."
tech,"Colin A. Norman, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science February 2nd, presented the Hubble Origins Probe (HOP) as a replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope. Concerning the shuttle's estimated one billion dollar cost and 65 month time-frame for deployment to earth orbit, Norman said: ""The groundbreaking science, the cutting edge technology generated in the development of new instrumentation, the ability of Hubble science to engage the interest of the public, and its impact on the imagination of students, make it worthwhile to invest this sum of public funds to complete the last chapter of Hubble's remarkable legacy."" HOP will tackle three of the most central intellectual issues of our age; the nature of dark energy, the nature and distribution of dark matter, and the prevalence of planets, including earths, around other stars. Norman noted during the testimony that HOP would be, essentially, a lighter copy of the Hubble Space Telescope and would include two instruments that were scheduled for installation on the Hubble: the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), plus the new Very Wide Field Imager (VWFI) to be paid for and provided by Japan. The VWFI has a field of view 17 times greater the advanced camera on board the Hubble now, and is 3-4 times more sensitive at critical wavelengths. This will provide for mapping 20 times faster than achievable by the Hubble at present. The COS would make possible the identification of the invisible portion of ""ordinary matter,"" potentially residing in gigantic gas clouds discovered by the Chandra X-ray Telescope. ""The WFC3 has greatly enhanced power for discovery in the blue and the red region of the spectrum and will significantly enhance studies of galaxies and stars. Its infrared capability is essential to studies of dark energy,"" Norman added. ""The decision is obvious. We must continue with the Hubble adventure to explore these great questions further, to understand more fully our remarkable Universe and our place in it. We must do this with intense determination and energy and thus continue to inspire new generations with the wonder and thrill of exploration and discovery,"" concluded Norman. Colin Norman was educated at the University of Melbourne and Oxford University. He has been a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University and astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute since 1984."
tech,"Space NASA, the space agency of the United States, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against former astronaut and sixth human to walk on the Moon Edgar Mitchell. NASA filed the lawsuit in a Miami federal court after learning of Mitchell's plans to auction off a camera that was used on the surface of the Moon during the Apollo 14 mission. Mitchell, 80, claims that he had permission from NASA to keep the camera, saying that astronauts of his era were permitted to keep mementos from their missions. He argues that had he not kept the camera, it would have been destroyed: ""It was government throwaways, government junk."" According to the lawsuit, however, NASA claims that ""All equipment and property used during NASA operations remains the property of NASA unless explicitly released or transferred to another party."" NASA goes on to claim that there is no official record of the possession of the camera being transferred to Mitchell. The camera, which Mitchell planned to sell because of financial problems, was expected to catch about US$60,000 to $80,000. Mitchell, along with Commander Alan Shepard and Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, flew to the moon aboard the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, the third manned lunar landing. While Roosa orbited above, Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours on the surface of the Moon. Shepard and Mitchell became the fifth and sixth humans to walk on the Moon, respectively."

tech,"Space Shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to touchdown at 12:32 p.m. EDT today in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Rockets were fired to slow down the shuttle at 11:25 a.m. EDT to begin the re-entry procedure. Weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Center are not forecast to be a problem, and the landing will take place as planned given a favorable crosswind. A second landing in Florida is possible at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:06 p.m. Also, NASA says that usual back-up landing sites at Edwards Air Force Base in California and White Sands in New Mexico are not expected to be used. Commander Scott Kelly was given the go-ahead for re-entry preparations after evaluation of the shuttle's wings and nose was completed, indicating no damage from space debris. The three-inch (7.6 cm) gash in the shuttle's belly reported earlier is likely not a safety risk, and should not lead to damage that requires any lengthy repair, NASA said. The shuttle will pass above Hurricane Dean on the approach to Florida, but the shuttle will be too high to be affected. The threat of Dean heading toward Texas earlier last week prompted NASA to cut the mission a few days short in the case that Dean tracked north toward Houston's Mission Control Center, potentially disabling operations."
tech,"SpaceNASA has decided to postpone the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery, mission STS-119, for at least four more days. The further delay of launch was due to a hydrogen fuel leak. Discovery was previously set to liftoff tonight at 9:20 p.m. (EDT). ""Space shuttle Discovery’s launch to the International Space Station (ISS) now is targeted for no earlier than March 15. Liftoff on March 15 would be at 7:43 p.m. EDT. The exact launch date is dependent on the work necessary to repair the problem,"" said NASA in a statement on their website. NASA said during a press conference today that the leak is likely being caused by a hardware issue, later announced to be a suspect connector on the gaseous vent line attached to the shuttle's external tank. Troubleshooting the problem is scheduled to begin on March 12. Discovery's original proposed launch was for July of 2008. Later it was changed to December 4, 2008. The next change scheduled the liftoff date for February 12, 2009. It was then delayed until February 27, but was then delayed indefinitely on February 20 after NASA discovered an issue with the hydrogen control valves. The current scheduled mission is set to fly the Integrated Truss Structure segment to the ISS, and to install the final set of power-generating solar arrays . The arrays consist of two 115-foot-long arrays, for a total span of 240 feet, including the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to twist as they track the sun. Altogether, the four sets of arrays can generate 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity – enough to provide power for more than 40 average homes. Commander Lee Archambault will lead Discovery's crew of seven, along with Pilot Tony Antonelli, and Mission Specialists Joseph Acaba, John Phillips, Steve Swanson, Richard Arnold, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata."

He went online to view images of the city's famous Beatles quarter on Mathew Street, an area in Liverpool synonymous with the Beatles and home to the Cavern Club where the band regularly played. The man saw intruders apparently breaking into a sports store. Then he telephoned the Merseyside Police. The police went to the scene and arrested 3 men. ""We did get a call from someone in Dallas who was watching on a webcam that looks into the tourist areas, of which Mathew Street is one because of all the Beatles stuff,"" a Merseyside Police spokeswoman said.

tech,"Researchers at Princeton University have conducted research into the security of electronic voting machines. They have created a virus that could breach voting machines and change votes. The creators of the voting machine say the research was unrealistic. Edward William Felten, a professor of computer sciences and public affairs at Princeton University, and two Princeton graduate students, Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman, created a computer virus that they say could remain concealed in tests, ""steal"" votes, delete itself to go undetected and spread to other machines. They used a Diebold AccuVote-TS which is a small computer with a touch screen. The latest version of the software used 128-bit data encryption, digitally signed memory card data, secure socket layer (SSL) data encryption for transmitting results and dynamic passwords. They opened the drawer with a key, picked the lock or undid screws to open the compartment that allows them to change the memory card. They suppressed the beep created by the computer when it reboots by using headphones. They say the virus can spread by using the same memory card which when inserted into a different machine will infect the machine. The researchers say they received the machine they tested on from someone who wants to keep their name anonymous. ""You have to be a good programmer — not a genius — to do this,"" Halderman said. ""I believe a good programmer could reproduce our virus without very much effort."" ""Analysis of the machine...shows that it is vulnerable to extremely serious attacks,"" the report states. ""An attacker who gets physical access to a machine or its removable memory card for as little as a minute could install malicious code."" Diebold Election Systems president Dave Byrd said that the research was done with security software that were two generations old. ""By any standard--academic or common sense--the study is unrealistic and inaccurate,"" he said in a statement. ""Normal security procedures were ignored. Numbered security tape, 18 enclosure screws and numbered security tags were destroyed or missing so that the researchers could get inside the unit. A virus was introduced to a machine that is never attached to a network."" ""Every voter in every local jurisdiction that uses the AccuVote-TS should feel secure knowing that their vote will count on Election Day,"" ""That's what they were saying a few years ago,"" said Halderman. He said he would very much like to study Diebold's newer machines and software. ""We expect and fear, unfortunately, that if we were to examine the newer version of the software, we could find similar problems."""
tech,"According to Dr. Vinton Cerf, a few movie producers have talked about using filesharing such as BitTorrent for the distribution of video content. Dr. Cerf is considered to be one of the fathers of the Internet. One of the problems with having a video on demand service is video files take quite a bit of bandwidth to distribute. Through the use of file sharing, the clients that are requesting a video can share information amongst themselves and can take some of the load off of the original distributor. The only draw back to using file sharing is the distribution would not be instant; instead, it would have to be pre-recorded like TiVo. Ironically, the movie industry has been suing people for file sharing for years now. In the end, this same technology might save the movie industry millions. Cerf said, ""They are only just now starting to come to honest grips with the possibilities of using the Internet,"" according to ZDNet Australia. Currently, waves of lawsuits against internet file-sharing services continue to be mounted. 11 countries across Europe and Asia have seen lawsuits filed against individuals by record companies fighting file-sharing technology which they say is costing it billions. The total number of lawsuits worldwide is in the range of 12,000."

Amongst the affected companies are Delta Air Lines, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines and All Nippon Airways, all of which are to reroute their flight paths between April 12 and April 16, in which time the North Korean government says launch is scheduled, with the specific date being subject to weather conditions. The North Korean government has stated the launch is to celebrate the 100th birthday of Eternal President of the Republic Kim il-Sung. A statement from Japan Airlines clarifies four of their flight paths are to be modified in direct response to these rocket launch plans, including three from the Japanese capital Tokyo to the Filipino capital Manila, Singapore, and Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, causing anticipated flight timings to rise by between five and twenty minutes. No modifications to domestic flights are planned for the airline. All Nippon Airways has stated that five of its flight routes are to vary at this time, with flights between similar locations affected. The flights will be otherwise unaffected, according to the company's statement."
tech,"A United Launch Alliance Atlas V carrier rocket launched this evening from LC-41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, USA, with the ICO G1 communications satellite for ICO Satellite Management. Lift-off occurred at 20:12:00 UTC. It is the first commercial launch of an Atlas rocket since responsibility for the launches was transferred from International Launch Services to United Launch Alliance, through Lockheed Martin. Launch was completely successful, with the spacecraft separating from its carrier rocket about half an hour after launch. The Atlas V flew in the 421 configuration, with a 4 metre wide payload fairing, twin solid rocket boosters, and a single-engined Centaur upper stage. It was the 14th flight of the Atlas V, and successfully placed the satellite into a geosynchronous orbit. The launch was dedicated to former Atlas programme employee Lynn Deckard. ICO G1 will provide S band mobile communications for satellite phones. Its launch had been delayed from May last year, owing to delays with US government missions which were launching on Atlas, and then in light of the failure of a previous Atlas launch in June. It was constructed by Space Systems/Loral, and is based on the LS-1300 satellite bus. It is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Atlas rocket, and the heaviest single commercial satellite to be launched into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. Speaking after the launch, Jim Sponnik, the Vice President of the Atlas programme told the team who had conducted the launch that they ""all did extremely well and the rocket did exceptionally well"". Colonel Scott Henderson, of the 45th Space Wing, United States Air Force, said that the launch was ""a great success"", and the result of ""phenomenal effort"" on the part of those involved. David Malcom, the President of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems described the launch as a ""hole in one"". Tim Bryan, the CEO of ICO Satellite Management told the United Launch Alliance team that he ""can't express...what every person in this room has done for our business"". He also thanked Bob Day, and ICO's space team, for their work in the build up to the launch. Michael Gass, the CEO of United Launch Alliance said that the successful launch was a ""testimony to this entire team"", and told flight controllers ""congratulations, you're the best"". The satellite's signal was acquired by ground tracking stations in Australia at 21:17, and the launch was confirmed to be accurate to within one nautical mile of the targeted orbit. The next Atlas launch is scheduled to occur in early July, with a DMSP weather satellite, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California."
tech,"At 15:35 UTC this afternoon (23:35 local time), the Chinese Long March 3C (CZ-3C) carrier rocket lifted off on its maiden flight, from launch pad 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre. It placed the Tianlian-1 satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. Tianlian-1, also known as Tian Lian 1 and TL-1, a spacecraft tracking and data relay communications satellite, similar in function to the American Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), will be used to track and communicate with manned Shenzhou spacecraft in low Earth orbit. It will be able to cover around half of the spacecraft's trajectory, compared to the 12 percent which can be covered by China's fleet of tracking ships and ground stations. The next Shenzhou mission, Shenzhou 7, is currently scheduled for launch in October. Tianlian-1 is based on the DFH-3 satellite bus. This is the 19th orbital launch of 2008, and the first this year to be conducted by the People's Republic of China. It is currently believed that China intend to conduct one more launch before the end of April, however due to secrecy surrounding China's space programme, it is difficult to be certain of this. The Long March 3C is a new version of the Long March 3 rocket, which serves as an intermediate between the Long March 3A, and the Long March 3B. It is 55 metres tall, and can place a 3,700 kilogram payload into a geosynchronous transfer orbit."

tech,"A new online television channel, Internacia Televido, has been launched following just over two years of fundraising and preparation. It is the first channel ever to be broadcast entirely through the international auxiliary language Esperanto, and was launched at midnight Brazilian time on Saturday night. The name means 'International Television'. The channel aims to create an international television network combining professional content with the collaboration of ordinary users from around the world. Programmes will range from news shows and documentaries to culture, educational programming and children's entertainment. The project, supported by the World Esperanto Association amongst others, was announced in October 2003 in São Paulo by Brazilian entrepreneur Flavio Rebelo, whose media business CIDCON also runs the Esperanto language web portal Ĝangalo ( www.ghangalo.com, 'Jungle') and publishes music. The original intention was to establish a 24-hour streamed online channel, with four hours of original programming per day (repeated six times daily) and a daily news bulletin. A subsequent international fundraising campaign to raise the required sum of €35,000 to establish the channel involved Rebelo speaking at several Esperanto events throughout Europe during the early months of 2004 through the support of an anonymous Asian donor. The project failed to garner sufficient funds to meet its original deadline, but in August this year Rebelo confirmed that a scaled-down version of the project would go ahead upon the sum of €23,000 being reached. The channel currently features 90 minutes of programming daily, with one weekly news bulletin, and three waged employees instead of the intended ten. It is intended that the channel will be funded past its initial six-month period through on-air advertising revenue and further private donations, and expanded as revenue permits. Experimental television broadcasts in Esperanto were not first made until the advent of Internet technology. A previous online Esperanto TV project ( www.esperanto.tv), under the auspices of the Italian Transnational Radical Party, failed to realise a finished product. Since the 1920s, radio broadcasts have been made regularly in Esperanto by broadcasters such as RAI, China Radio International and Radio Polonia. * Internacia Televido website"
tech,"The Swedish language edition of the multilingual Wikipedia project passed 100,000 articles this evening at 18:11 CEST. Swedish is the fifth language to reach this milestone, joining English, French, German, and Japanese. The article growth was quite modest when 100 articles remained, but at 18:09, with less than 50 articles left, people started submitting a lot of articles. Most of them were written in advance, according to visitors at the IRC channel. The 100,000th article is believed to be about a minister of the Faroe Islands, Jógvan við Keldu, according to announcement pages on the site minutes after the milestone was passed. Some concerns were raised, however, and a Wikipedian claimed on the village pump that the article Epiglottal klusil (""linguistic subject"") was number 100,000. The Swedish edition is said to have been started in May 2001, but didn't see much growth until November 2002 when several contributors arrived. The 50,000 mark was passed less than a year ago. The Swedish Wikipedia operates using the same basic principles as its larger English language sister edition, which include writing from a Neutral Point of View and making content open using the GNU Free Documentation License. The size is quite large compared to the number of speakers of Swedish worldwide (about 9 million). The Swedish edition is larger than some languages with hundreds of millions of speakers such as Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Hindi. The reason for this is somewhat obscure, but discussions on the central discussion forum of the site, Bybrunnen (a literal translation of ""village pump""), say this is because articles are considerably shorter than on other Wikipedias and that the Internet connectivity is very high in Sweden. Other Wikipedias for languages spoken in Northern Europe (including Norwegian, Danish and Finnish) also have a high number of articles compared to the number of speakers."
tech,"A Tuesday service cutoff deadline in the United States for tens of thousands of VoIP customers who failed to reply to a service limitation notification from their provider was extended by 30 days, to September 28. In an FCC mandate, VoIP providers such as Time Warner Cable, Vonage and Verizon, were to send notice to customers asking them acknowledge the possible limitations of E911 access and to keep a record of their replies. Specifically, the FCC mandated that VoIP providers must advise subscribers of the circumstances under which E911 service may not be available, and distribute stickers or other appropriate labels with a warning that E911 service may be limited or not available, and instruct the subscriber to place them on or near the equipment used in conjunction with the service. Lastly, the provider is to obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgement by every subscriber, both new and existing. A significant number of VoIP customers did not reply to the warning letter. This led the Voice on the Net Coalition, with House Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN) and Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) and other lawmakers to write FCC Chairman Kevin Martin with their concerns. For some customers, it was feared that if the VoIP service was ended, they would have no phone service. The E911 system allows emergency operators to link a caller's physical location with the phone used to dial for help. Conventional phones have had that capability for years, but not all VoIP providers have the technology for such a system in place. Cell phone companies are also struggling to upgrade their products for E911 capability. VoIP use reported by the TeleGeography Research Group showed strong customer growth during the second quarter of this year. Subscribers increased nearly 40 percent over the first quarter, from roughly 1.9 million to 2.7 million. Users of VoIP seem far from scared off by concerns over E911 connectivity despite findings that indicate the majority are interested in it as a primary phone line replacement. ""To get VoIP telephony, you’ve got to have a broadband connection, that means you’re a reasonably affluent consumer, you’ve got a cell phone, you’ve got some sort of backup plan in place,"" said Stephan Beckert, an analyst for TeleGeography. ""There was a group that said they would not get it because of the problems with E911. But there was a surprisingly large core group that really didn’t worry about it."""
tech,"The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed on Wednsday the nomination of Dr. Michael Griffin to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), making him the 11th administrator of the US-based space agency. He takes office at a time when NASA is busy with preparations for the return to flight of the space shuttle Discovery, expected sometime during the launch window of May 15 through June 3, 2005. The presidential nominee Griffin was the head of the Applied Physics Laboratory's Space Department at Johns Hopkins University, a position he held almost a year. Prior to that, he was a chief engineer at NASA before coming over from service as Deputy for Technology at the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. He has made a career of the aerospace field. Griffin was critical at times of U.S. priorities in space exploration by questioning its continued commitment to the International Space Station. Griffin, in testimony before the House Science Committee in 2004, outlined more ambitious plans for human exploration and settlement of the solar system in which he believes the United States should play a key role. In a statement during his April 12, 2005, confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, Griffin said, ""In the twenty-first century and beyond, for America to continue to be preeminent among nations, it is necessary for us also to be the preeminent spacefaring nation,"" with a spirit of discovery similar to the exploration of the New World by Columbus with the support of the Spanish crown. Griffin, 55, notably holds seven academic degrees from various institutions, including a bachelor's degree in physics; master's degrees in aerospace science, electrical engineering, applied physics, civil engineering and business administration; and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland. The list of NASA's upcoming priorities, as outlined by Griffin during his confirmation hearing, offer insight into the direction that America's space program may take under his leadership. In his prepared statement, Griffin said, ""my priorities in executing the duties of NASA Administrator, consistent with the President’s Vision for Space Exploration, will be: - Flying the Shuttle as safely as possible until its retirement, not later than 2010. - Bringing a new Crew Exploration Vehicle into service as soon as possible after Shuttle retirement. - Developing a balanced overall program of science, exploration, and aeronautics at NASA, consistent with the redirection of the human spaceflight program to focus on exploration. - Completing the International Space Station in a manner consistent with our International partner commitments and the needs of human exploration. - Encouraging the pursuit of appropriate partnerships with the emerging commercial space sector. - Establishing a lunar return program having the maximum possible utility for later missions to Mars and other destinations."" President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration, referred to by Griffin above, is currently United States policy on various aspects of space exploration, announced on January 14, 2004 after the Space Shuttle Columbia Disaster of February 1, 2003. The US is committed to a future of both human and robotic exploration of the solar system, with an emphasis on maintaining safety and advancing scientific and technical knowledge."

tech,"ESA - C.Carreau NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has detected methane in the atmosphere of a planet 63 light-years away, marking the first discovery of an organic compound on a planet outside our Solar System. The methane was found on a Jupiter-sized planet named HD 189733b. The planet closely orbits HD 189733, a yellow dwarf star in the constellation Vulpecula. Although methane can play a key role in the chemical reactions needed to form life, the planet is too close to its parent star to support life, scientists say. It is known as a ""hot Jupiter"" - a planet whose mass is comparable to that of Jupiter, but orbits nearer to the parent star than Mercury, our Solar System's innermost planet. This particular hot Jupiter takes just two days to completely orbit its parent star, and the temperatures in its atmosphere can reach 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, around the melting point of silver. Mark Swain ""The methane here, although we can call it an organic constituent, is not produced by life - it is way too hot there for life,"" said Giovanna Tinetti, part of the NASA team that made the discovery. However, scientists believe the spectroscopic methods used to detect the methane can be used to find organic compounds on other distant planets. ""This observation is proof that spectroscopy can eventually be done on a cooler and potentially habitable Earth-sized planet orbiting a dimmer red dwarf-type star,"" said Mark Swain, a NASA scientist whose paper on the discovery will appear in the scientific journal Nature. Spectroscopy is the splitting of light into its components. As the light from the star passed through the planet's atmosphere, the atmospheric gases imprinted their chemical signature onto the light, allowing the atmosphere's chemical composition to be analyzed by Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. To their surprise, astronomers found much higher levels of methane than had been predicted for hot Jupiters. ""This indicates we don't really understand exoplanet atmospheres yet,"" said Swain. This discovery also confirmed the presence of water molecules in the planet's atmosphere, which was found by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope last year using spectroscopy. ""With this observation there is no question whether there is water or not - water is present,"" Swain said. The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify the molecules of more Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of stars, where conditions may be favorable for life. Adam Showman at the University of Arizona said, ""We are thus now seeing but the opening salvo in a revolution that will extend humankind's view of planetary worlds far beyond the provincial boundaries of our Solar System."" Giovanna Tinetti, who co-authored the Nature article, believes the concept of life on other planets is not too unlikely. ""My personal view is it is way too arrogant to think that we are the only ones living in the Universe,"" she says."
tech,"On Wednesday, long-time White House correspondent Helen Thomas questioned White House Press Secretary Dana Perino bluntly and repeatedly about United States President George W. Bush's recent confirmation that he had approved CIA interrogation policies that included waterboarding. ""Where is everybody?"" asked Thomas, apparently frustrated with lack of attention her colleagues had given the issue. The community at the social news site reddit answered ""Here we are""; a message they plan to deliver along with several thousand dollars in flowers and other gifts. Thomas's questions became front-page news on reddit this morning, via a Think Progress blog post that includes a C-SPAN 2 video clip of Thomas during yesterday's press briefing. Noting the president's repeated assertion that the U.S. does not torture, Thomas characterized the authorized interrogation techniques as torture. ""Now he has admitted that he did sign off on torture, he did know about it,"" said Thomas, ""so how do you reconcile this credibility gap?"" Perino reiterated that the ""United States has not, is not torturing any detainees in the global war on terror."" Helen Thomas Whether waterboarding, among other techniques, should be categorized as torture has been a subject of political contention in recent months. Thomas was unequivocal, responding to Perino: ""That's not my question. My question is, why did he say publicly 'we do not torture', when he really did know that we do?"" In appreciation of the reporter asking ""A REAL QUESTION"" (as the headline put it), reddit users (known as ""redditors"") have collected over $3,000 for the purchase of flowers, edible arrangements and other gifts. Several 'redditors' also claimed to have ordered flowers for Thomas independently. The bulk of the money was collected through Chipin.com, on a donation page created Micah Fitch, a musician and graphic designer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of publication, the site registered 400 contributors for a total of $3,125. Fitch also created a wiki, FlowersWiki, for organizing the gift purchases and selecting messages to go with them. A large delivery to the Washington D.C. offices of Thomas's employer Hearst Newspapers is being scheduled for Friday morning. One redditor claims that a friend who works for The Daily Show is pitching the story to the show's staff. This is not the first time Thomas has received a high-volume flower gift. In 2006, an e-mail campaign that began on the political website Democratic Underground collected over $2000 and resulted in delivery of 108 dozen roses."
tech,". The article below states April 18 which is incorrect. ScientologyThe Internet group Anonymous today held further protests critical of the Church of Scientology. The global protests started in Australia where several hundred protesters gathered at different locations for peaceful protests. In a global speech, the Internet protest movement said Scientology ""betrayed the trust of its members, had taken their money, their rights, and at times their very lives."" The protesters welcomed the public interest their protests have led to, and claimed they witnessed ""an unprecedented flood of Scientologists joining us across the world to testify about these abuses."" The group said it would continue with monthly actions. In a press statement from its European headquarters, Scientology accused the anonymous protesters of ""hate speech and hate crimes"", alleging that security measures were necessary because of death threats and bomb threats. This also makes the Church want to ""identify members"" of the group it brands as ""cyber-terrorists"". Wikinews had correspondents in a number of protest locations to report on the events. Anonymous states that the next protest is scheduled to take place on April 18, which happens to be the birthday of Suri, the daughter of Tom and Katie Cruise. News.com.au reported that approximately 200 masked protesters gathered outside of the Church of Scientology's headquarters in Adelaide. An anonymous spokesman told News.com.au that their group feels Scientology should not have tax-exempt status, and should not be considered a religion. At one point six police officers came by the protest; four members of a security firm stood outside the Scientology building throughout the protest. Adelaide Gallery * Adelaide protest in pictures :Main article: Protesters arrested at anti-Scientology event in Atlanta In Atlanta, police arrested two protesters for, supposedly, using a bullhorn without a permit although reports confirm that there is no law or ordinance in Atlanta necessitating one. The police were under the impression that they were arresting the leaders of the protesters. The anonymous protesters reacted by shouting that they have no leader, but they made no attempts to free those arrested. The police also pulled over cars for honking at the protesters, causing them to make signs ""Do not honk"". Volunteer Correspondent: Bhig3 Almost 135 protesters protested outside of the Church of Scientology location in Austin, Texas. Protesters received a permit to protest from 11AM to 4PM and stayed the full time allowed. Law enforcement officers were stationed outside the doors of the Church. These officers were very kind and open to conversation with Anonymous members. Protesters gathered across the street from the building as well as directly in front of it, waving signs and chanting. A UHaul van was converted to a Party Van which was eventually parked directly in front of the Church building for most of the day. Reports of Scientologists calling the UHaul company office, illegally claiming to be police officers, reached protesters soon after the van was parked. The protesters responded with a loud speaker saying ""Impersonating a police officer is illegal, even on the phone!"" Around 2:30PM a young man arrived in front of the Church to counter the Anonymous group with a yellow sign reading ""Freedom of Religion"" on one side, and ""It's Their Choice"" on the other. He began by calling out ""It's their Choice"" to which the protesters across the street replied ""We Agree"" and then ""Right to join, Right to leave!"" Some Anonymous members swarmed over to confront the man, but were restrained to one-on-one talks with him by another Anonymous member. He later left the area after talks with the protesters. BBC News drove by taking video of the protesters, but did not stop for interviews. Correspondent: TUFKAAP Over 250 Anonymous protesters were out in force once more on the corners, at Boston's Scientology church at the corners of Beacon and Hereford Streets. Protesters only took up three corners, instead all four like they did on February 10th as police asked them politely to leave the street in front of Church vacant. Even though the protesters had a permit for all streets, they complied. Wikinews talked to the Boston Police and was denied a video statement by one officer telling the reporter, ""Get out of here,"" and brushing him off. However, the reporter asked another officer if there had been any trouble. The officer responded that there had been ""no trouble, just people walking back and forth."" Most the protest consisted of protesters handing out information pamphlets, DVDs, viral marketing cards for their campaign, talking to pedestrians who were passing by, shouting Internet memes to one another and shouting various chants. Some Anonymous put forward concerns about Scientology plants in the crowd trying to incite disruption, however, none was noted. Other protesters mentioned there were rumors that the Scientologists were going to bus in Scientology students to disrupt the protester, however, that did not occur. Scientologists were outside taking photos of the protesters, unlike February 10th, where they remained inside and photographing from the building. The Wikinews reporter asked a Scientologist why he taking pictures, he took the reporter's photograph and noted that he ""was just taking pictures."" Wikinews asked a church member if he would like to give a statement to Wikinews on camera, they denied the request and told the reporter they would send a statement via email to him. However, Wikinews has not yet received a statement from the Boston church. * YouTube video of TUFKAAP's report Video Boston Galleries Image:Protester confronts cameraman.jpg|A protester confronts a Scientolgist cameraman.

The turnout was about half that of the previous protest with only 20 or so people present. Per advice from the police, cake was not on offer. It had been pointed out that this would likely get the protesters overrun by children and vagrants. Unlike other countries, Belgium has laws prohibiting protesters to cover their faces, leaving the protesters to wear sunglasses and shawls. The protest could not take place in front of Scientology's headquarters because an E.U. summit was scheduled to continue until today. Scientology members were allowed to be active outside their headquarters, for their ""open door day"". No special activities inside their building was observed, just volunteers handing out flyers to perhaps a dozen passers-by. The press release for this open door day was devoted to Anonymous: 4=Scientology press release The Scientologists said the event was inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is however remembered on December 10 (also mentioned on the flags outside their office, see photo). The United Nations Human Rights Council was established on March 15 (2006), a date closer to this weekend. Wikinews spoke to a Scientology representative in the European headquarters, which are located in the political heart of Brussels; Law Street, just next to the Belgian and European parliament. Since Scientology was devoting the afternoon to human rights, we asked for Scientology's opinion about human rights controversies in the United States (such as the Guantanamo Bay detainees). The representative told Wikinews that the Church is a religious movement and avoids taking general political stances. The representative was also confident about the outcome of a pending lawsuit from the Belgian federal prosecutor. After an eight-year investigation, the Belgian justice said that the local and European chapters, as well as, members would be accused of blackmailing, swindling members, breaking trade and privacy laws, unlawfully practising medicine, and forming a criminal organisation. ""The file is empty,"" said the Scientology representative, who asserted that the inquiry had been so lengthy because the state could not prove any wrongdoings by the Church. He said that unlike in the US, Scientology is not seeking official recognition in Belgium, which recognises only six religions. He also claimed that there were more than 1,000 Scientologists in Belgium. Anonymous distributed flyers and informed passers-by about Scientology. In a speech, they called for a dialogue with Scientology members, and said they were concerned for the parishioners' well-being: 4=Anonymous' global speech Operation: Party Hard - expect us, with cake was closed off with a birthday cake for the protesters. Belgian media were in attendance with a film crew from RTBF interviewing several of the protesters and capturing their banners on tape. The slogans were mostly in English, ranging from ""Religion is free, Scientology isn't"" to ""One billion years of servitude = super powers"" — the latter a reference to the contracts that Scientologists sign when they become involved with the church's Sea Org. The police presence was low-key with only one senior officer and a member of the Belgian intelligence services who took photographs.

Correspondents: Adambro, Skenmy, JamesHarrison Once more, protests took place outside of both the Queen Victoria Scientology Headquarters and the Tottenham Court Road Dianetics centre. The additional time available for protesters in the aftermath of a rushed February 10th protest allowed the many of Anonymous to expand their protest to include even more outreach towards members of the public, with Anonymous members handing out free cake, sweets and other confectionery along with leaflets and stickers to passers-by. Signage was loud and varied, proclaiming a variety of messages to the public and Scientologists. Many of the signs declared amusing yet pointed comments, with others making more serious jabs at the Church of Scientology. Despite a larger police presence at the Tottenham Court Road protest, the protesters and Scientologists were both peaceful. Police officers, when asked if they had had any problems with the protesters, replied, somewhat jovially, ""I can't really speak to you, the only thing I can say is 'No comment'. No problems. I mean no comment."" Interview This interview was carried out with members of Anonymous at the Tottenham Court Road protest. Church of Scientology representatives refused an interview and have not made any comment at the time of going to press. *WikinewsWhat has the public's reaction been to the protest, and what are your views on it? :Anonymous Member 1: Lots of people have been taking leaflets, you can see some people stopping to look at signs, it's very interesting. The ground covered- from nothing to this in six weeks is stunning. It's an internet phenomenon, definitely. It's people around the planet, they've suddenly realised they can communicate, and I think the whole Anonymous thing is the start of something different, it definitely feels like something's happening. *WNIn terms of Anonymous's lack of organisation as a collective in their protests towards the Church of Scientology, how do you feel about that and how has it really come together? :Anonymous Member 2: Well, everyone here is an individual, there's actual people behind the masks, even though we all look like the same person. As far as Scientology is concerned, I can't really say what any one person's motivations are because we don't have motivations as a group. Everybody is here as individuals, and for their own reasons... I think the great thing is the fact that with all our individual motivations and reasons we still manage to come together; we're a ton of people from the Internet, we don't know each other in real life; and we get together and have this kind of giant protest. It's amazing. *WNIn terms of the Church of Scientology as an entity, what's your personal motivation- as a member of Anonymous- for protesting against the Church? :Anonymous Member 2: Personally, the thing I feel most strongly about is the way they abuse their members. Cases like Lisa McPherson, for example, and people in RPF camps, and all the people who have died as a result of the Church's actions.That, I think, is the biggest thing for me. But there's also their status as a religion. Well, really, it's not. It's a business, and they need to acknowledge that. *WNWhat would you say are the main objections of Anonymous against the Church of Scientology? :Anonymous Member 3: I honestly can't speak for Anonymous, I can only speak for myself, and I believe that the Church of Scientology's fight against civil liberties in this country is something that has to be protested against. That's why I'm here today. Reporters also spoke with members of the police: *WNHow has it been to work with a group like Anonymous? :Met. Police Officer: It's been fine, there's been no problems at all.

It started at Deansgate, which is the same location as the one for the start of the February 10 protests. Members of Anonymous have told Wikinews that their members started arriving at 09:00 local time. Protesters were holding placards with statements such as “Freedom of religion - A right / Freedom to oppress - A crime.” Placards asking “How do I anger seasoned Amnesty International prize winning journalist, John Sweeney?” were also held as part of the protest. John Sweeney was heavily featured in the UK press after he produced a documentary in which he claimed representatives of the Church of Scientology were constantly following him. As with the other protests, protesters brought cake, as a result of it being close to the birthday of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology. One of the protesters told Wikinews that “The so-called Church of Scientology's multiple violations of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights have gone unnoticed and unchallenged for far too long.” He continued saying that “the corporation needs to learn that suppression of free speech, institution of forced labour and the more general suppression of its parishioners is both legally and morally wrong. The protests will continue until such a time that major changes are made to the Scientology's organizational structure, or until they meet accusations of wrongdoing head-on and provide evidence that the community's worries are unfounded.” He added that he was “not protesting against the religion of Scientology, but the corporation that delivers it.” Interview This interview was carried out yesterday with two of the Manchester protesters. *WikinewsWhy do you consider it important to take part in the protests? :Anonymous Member 1:We consider it important to take part, most of us are regular Internet users who believe in free speech. The CoS Church of Scientology, ed. has on numerous instances suppressed the flow of information regarding any of their criticisms or more esoteric beliefs. Examples include the ARS newsgroup during the 90s, and the recently leaked Tom Cruise video. :We are taking part to demonstrate our beliefs that freedom of knowledge and information are basic human rights. Most of us have also done our own research regarding the CoS, and come to the conclusion that it is a malign cult, that harms its members and tries to subvert public opinion to further its own ends. *WNHow many people do you expect to attend the protests worldwide? : Anon. 1: No real way of knowing until the day and head counts are done, but we are hoping to exceed Feb 10th due to a lot of Anonymous members not turning up due to fear of retaliation, laziness, or generally not being sure of what to do. Videos of the Feb 10th have shown how peaceful yet fun the protests are, so we are hoping to do quite well on the 15th. *WNWhy are you protesting against CoS? :Anon. 1: We are protesting the CoS, not the religious doctrine itself. Whilst many of us may disagree with some of the faith's tenants, we believe freedom of religion is every person's right. However the CoS uses this sacred human right to perform immoral and illegal actions, whilst labeling anyone who criticises it as Religious bigots, terrorists, or criminals. *WNMany people consider some of the actions taken by anonymous illegal. Do you think your actions are justified? :Anon. 2:The problem with this question is the way Anonymous is organised, as it isn't organised. It's just a collection of people from various corners of the Internet. If someone makes a threat to the CoS and says they're Anonymous there's nothing we can do to stop them saying that, Anonymous doesn't have a membership card. :Anon. 1: Yes.

It was a cold and foggy day with temperatures in the low 30's (F) which is significantly warmer than the previous February 10 protests that drew only about 50 people. People filled Main Street across from the Church in a line which extended an entire city block. A radio was on hand playing 'Rick Roll' and also the audio recording of the Scientology interview with Tom Cruise. The day started off with an off duty Buffalo Police detective instructing the crowd to protest peacefully. The detective, who was identified to Wikinews only as 'Detective Tim' then immediately told protesters to remove masks that could be considered threatening. Scarves were allowed as it was a cold day, but bandannas were not permitted to be worn. Wikinews was earlier accused of being ""fake"" and Detective 'Tim' refused to give a statement to Wikinews saying ""no media. You made that (press badge) from the Internet. I never seen this site before."" 'Tim' then refused outright to give his last name and badge number. 'Tim' was quoted only during his time speaking publicly to the protesters. Shortly after instructing people to remove masks, 'Tim' then accused a member of Anonymous of ""portraying an Arabic terrorist"" because of a scarf he was wearing and asked him to remove it. Shortly after, at least three protesters were detained by police and questioned after taking photographs and video of the Church from across the street. Police approached the three and began to ""yell"" at them. 'Tim' then told one protester that ""the Church want you arrested. Now how am I going to avoid that."" The protester then willingly handed over his videotape of the church and asked not to be arrested. Subsequently all three were released without being charged. According to Detective 'Tim', ""the tape is now the property of the police."" The protesters were not on Church property and were only filming the areas of the Church visible from across the streets. During the protest, a member of Anonymous read a speech, which according to him, was a worldwide speech to all Churches. ""Today - The Ides of March - is the day Julius Caesar was betrayed by those he trusted. Today we gather together as Anonymous to call attention to another betrayal of trust - that of the Church of Scientology upon its followers. Since is inception, Scientology has traded in false hopes and promises, betrayed the trust of its members, taken their money, their rights, and at times their very lives,"" said the statement. ""Last month 10,000 people demonstrated in one hundred and seven cities across the world. They came together to make the first breach in the wall of silence,"" added the statement. Despite the incident, 'Tim' was friendly to the protesters, even stating that ""he might be back later to have a few cupcakes."" According to a member of Anonymous, ""we will come again, our numbers ever increasing, in April, May, June and July.""

One group was to assemble at Westlake Center, and would march from there to the Scientology site. The other group was to meet at the Seattle Center, closer to the site, disseminating fliers to the crowd. Protesters began to gather in front of Westlake Center at about 9:30 PDT. with about a dozen protesters at first. One of the protesters revealed to me that he was a 30 year former member of the Church of Scientology from the Los Angeles area. He asserted that ""this protest is just."" He spoke of former members who have been afraid to come out, because of the continuously reinforced teachings of the church. Members are cautioned against looking onto the Internet for alternate information, that they could die if they were to even look at the Internet. The mind is trained not to seek out any information that could contradict the church's teachings. He said that if the Scientologists ever knew what really happens in the church management, they would be terrified, and turn away in droves. Other members carried picket signs and leaflets. Early on, many of the crowd members were chatting with each other, sometimes taking pictures of each other. Passers by gave the assembled crowd mixed reactions to being approached. One of the members of the public expressed concern that a protest in Seattle would not do much, ""They oughta be picketing Tom Cruise's house."" Curiously, a few members actually took pictures of me standing off to the side with my camera. A few accused me of being from the church, attempting to gain identifiable information, and were therefore cautious. Others saw me as the only person around without a mask, and in this crowd I was the outsider. At about 11:00 PDT, the crowd started to proceed north, up 5th Avenue in downtown Seattle. At no point did I witness any of the Anonymous group committing a crime. I however, could probably have been cited on multiple counts for jaywalking, in attempts to get a decently framed shot from my digital camera without being seen as marching with the crowd. Numerous car horns blared during the crowd's exodus down 5th Avenue. As the street took a turn north, the crowd passed Fischer Plaza, home to local ABC affiliate KOMO-TV. I noted that I had not seen any mainstream media coverage of the event. The march turned down Broad Street, and at this point I gave up trying to keep pace in front of the crowd. I pulled over to the side of the sidewalk, next to a chain link fence to get the last photos of this phase of the protest. Afterwards, I followed the procession as it turned onto Aurora, and reached the Scientology center. The center itself is situated on one end of an overpass, Aurora Avenue crosses over Mercer Street here, and eastbound traffic on Mercer was treated to a large banner proclaiming ""HONK AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY"" The banner generated a considerable number of car horns, which resulted in an equal number of cheers from the crowd. On the north side of the center, more protesters positioned themselves around the parking lot. Very few members were visible, for a long time there was only one standing near the entrance back in a fenced off area. Members of the crowd would level jeers at the man, such as ""What are your crimes?"" Eventually two police officers arrived, who stationed themselves in the parking lot, observing the crowd and calmly turning back any protester who crossed into the parking lot with a warning. No Scientology personnel approached the crowd, or a member of the press.

tech,"Japan Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, yesterday said the revealed leaking of an estimated 300 metric tons of radioactive water at the damaged Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant was a ""serious incident"", level three on the seven-part international scale. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), who run the plant, announced the leak last week and the new accident's level-three rating was made after consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the Nuclear Regulation Authority notes this estimate may be overstated as it relies on the leaking tank being full before the leak began. There is no gauge to measure water quantities inside the tank, used to store contaminated water after the initial accident. Water is being collected at a rate of 400 tons per day, and an unknown quantity of radioactive groundwater is flowing into the sea. Industry minister Toshimitsu Motegi has already announced increased governmental supervision of TEPCO's leak mitigation after two other leaks this year. Motegi said TEPCO's antileak methods were like ""whack-a-mole"". Nuclear Regulation Authority disaster taskforce leader Shinji Kinjo has said TEPCO fails to document inspections and is poor at monitoring the tanks on the site. TEPCO staff had said water levels in the tank had remained constant. Shunichi Tanaka, head of the Nuclear Regulation Authority, said ""We have no idea whether it's actually 300 tons that leaked. We need to look into this issue more."" TEPCO initially said the leak was small when it was found in July and the watchdog gave it a level one ""anomaly"" rating at the time. Inspectors now say radiation below this tank stands at 100 millisieverts per hour, and another at the facility has a level of 70 millisieverts per hour. ""One hundred millisieverts per hour is equivalent to the limit for accumulated exposure over five years for nuclear workers; so it can be said that we found a radiation level strong enough to give someone a five-year dose of radiation within one hour,"" said TEPCO boss Masayuki Ono last week. TEPCO shares dropped yesterday by 2.6% to 497 yen."
tech,"A team of scientists at Stanford University claim to have detected a subtle, missing element of Einstein's theory of relativity. In a press release dated February 16th, Robert Kahn, Stanford University's Public Affairs Coordinator, announced the experimental confirmation of frame dragging, an effect in which the presence of a rotating body causes space itself to be pulled along as the body rotates. While the effect was theorized by Josef Lense and Hans Thirring as far back as 1918, the small scale of the effect, as little as one part in a trillion for a satellite orbiting the Earth, made detecting the effect difficult. Many people are surprised when they learn that the two theories of relativity have passed every experiment that has been designed to test them. Are you surprised that the weirdness predicted by relativity has been experimentally verified?The observation was made by the Gravity Probe B satellite, which carries finely-machined gyroscopes. Scientists looked for small changes in the motion of the gyroscopes to detect the frame dragging effect, as well as the much larger geodetic effect &amp;ndash; small corrections to the Earth's gravitational field due to differences between Einstein's and Newton's theories of gravity. The experiment was conducted on the satellite from 2004 to 2005. However, the complexity of the data analysis along with unforeseen engineering problems have made finding the effect in the experiment's results difficult. In particular, the presence of small electrical charges on the gyroscopes interfered with their results. Francis Everitt, the experiment's Principal Investigator, stresses in an interview with the New York Times that their announcement is only preliminary and that, with further analysis, they hope to improve the precision of their results; currently, they say they have only detected the frame dragging effect to within plus or minus fifteen percent of its expected value. The theory of general relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain the behavior of moving objects in space, after the discovery that the speed of light was always the same no matter how the person measuring it was moving. While it successfully explains many strange behaviors in space, such as the slow shifting of the orbit of Mercury and the bending of light by massive objects such as black holes, testing the theory on Earth has always been difficult due to the small scale of relativity's effects in everyday life."
tech,"Thomas Rivinius There is only visible light so far. We know of no other radiation spectrum. WNIQ What are some of the other observed systems that have similar radiation emission? Thomas Rivinius As I said, this is from the point-of-view of the stars, these are just normal stars. And the black hole does not contribute anything to the emission of the radiation. WNIQ What does the future of these stars look like? Thomas Rivinius The outer star will just evolve very normally just like any other star of its mass. The inner star will become a super giant as well. But when it ends its supergiant phase, it will be big enough to get accounted into the black hole and then the black hole will start accreting. It is hard to say what happens then. It may get big enough for the black hole to actually fall into the star, and then shortly after the star falls into the black hole, or it might end with the accretion. WNIQ So you are saying there is a chance the black hole may create an accretion disk feeding on this inner star? Thomas Rivinius It will certainly. But it will take another few million years. WNIQ Were you expecting a black hole to be so close to the Solar System? Thomas Rivinius Ah yes, as I said, there must be many black holes. I mean, there are certainly black holes which are closer. It's just not very likely to find them. They are not infrequent objects. They are interestingly very frequent objects. There are just very hard to find. WNIQ What future investigations is your team planning for? Thomas Rivinius With interferometry, we want to image that, and maybe we want to look in the catalogues if we can find a similar system. We are looking for candidates where we might reasonably expect that it might be similar and then we can have a look in detail. WNIQ What lies ahead in this system to be discovered? Thomas Rivinius Well, basically what we still have to do with this system is to make the numbers certain. Right now, what we have is limits. We have a lower limit for the mass. But what we can do is we get precise value for the mass. We only have a rough distance, we can get a precise distance. We can measure the chemical composition of the stars that still exists, if they in any way have been altered or affected by the original primary, when the most massive star went supernova. So it should tell us a lot, in principle, about heterogeneous systems about how such massive stars evolve. WNIQ Are there any plans to observe the nearby binary stars for black holes? Thomas Rivinius As I said, we are looking into the catalogues. If we can find similar systems that could give us hints, that might be promising candidates. But even if they are frequent, they are not that frequent that we could observe every star and just look for black holes. That is not an efficient use of telescope time. WNIQ Are there any other observations you have been working on? Thomas Rivinius Ah, well, there's a lot of things I'm working on. But they are unrelated to this particular project. WNIQ What is your role at the ESO? Thomas Rivinius At the ESO, I am a science operations astronomer. Which means that I run the telscopes; I support other astronomers when they come here to conduct the observations, and when they cannot come, or do not want to come which also happens, I do the observations for them. And I do this about 60% of my working time, I work for the observatory in this capacity, and one third of my working time I do my own research. WNIQ Well, those were all the questions I had for you. Is there something you would like to add? Thomas Rivinius No, I think that was fine, thank you. WNIQ Thank you for agreeing for this interview. It had been a great pleasure discussing this with you. Thomas Rivinius Thank you. Ciao."
tech,"American corporation DivX, Inc. announced on Monday that it will shut its Stage6 website that hosts videos made by users. The shutdown will take effect on February 28, 2008 and is because the firm no longer have the resources to keep it online. ""Why are we shutting the service down? Well, the short answer is that the continued operation of Stage6 is a very expensive enterprise that requires an enormous amount of attention and resources that we are not in a position to continue to provide. There are a lot of other details involved, but at the end of the day it’s really as simple as that,"" said Tom, who is also known as 'Spinner' in the statement on the website and an employee of DivX, Inc. the San Diego, California-based host of the webservice. In October 2007, Universal Music Group filed a federal lawsuit against DivX, Inc. for copyright infringement after users posted hundreds of music videos on Stage6. Chief Executive Kevin Hell said in a statement: ""By no longer expending resources on Stage6, we sharpen our focus on creating a global standard for digital video."" Videos can no longer be uploaded, but will be able to be watched and downloaded until February 28. Stage6 made its debut in 2006. It hosted movie clips, television shows and music videos along with content made by the site's users in the popular DivX codec."
tech,"The People's Republic of China today launched its first moon orbiter as part of the country's lunar exploration program. At 18:05 hours local time (10:05 UTC) the rocket Chang'e 1 lifted off from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwestern China. The name of the probe refers to the Chinese goddess of the moon. The state television network broadcast live footage of the countdown and launch, which took place in the presence of Chinese officials and some 2,000 Chinese who paid around US$100 to attend the event, but without any international press. The 2350 kg probe is expected to enter a lunar orbit on November 5. On its year-long mission, Chang'e 1 will obtain three dimensional images of the Moon's surface and gather information related to the chemical and physical properties of the lunar soil. It will do so circulating at about 200 kilometers above the lunar surface. On its way to the Moon the spacecraft will register data regarding the solar winds, or space weather. It will also broadcast 30 patriotic Chinese songs when orbiting the Moon. The officially-Communist nation which hosts next year's Olympics hopes to put a taikonaut on the moon in ten to 15 years. Last month, Japan launched a lunar probe while India hopes to achieve the same next April. In 2003, China used one of their own rockets to get the astronaut Yang Liwei into space. Yang told the Xinhua News Agency last week that once China has a manned space station, he and his fellow taikonauts could form a new branch of the Communist Party in space. Last January, China used a rocket to blow up one of its own satellites, sparking fears from the United States and other countries that China might have a military agenda in space, besides the problems of space pollution and danger to other satellites the explosion caused. China says the goals of its space program are scientific and peaceful."
tech,"CanadaA University of Calgary research team developed a new method for extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the air — a fundamental shift in carbon capture technology enabling capture of the most common greenhouse gas from so-called diffuse sources like aircraft, trucks and automobiles that represent half of the greenhouse gases emitted globally. Professor David Keith, Director of University of Calgary's (UofC) Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) and a team of researchers from UofC's Energy and Environmental Systems Group built and operated a prototype system this summer producing results that compared favourably with commercial carbon capture systems. Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still ""many pitfalls along the path to commercialization."" Using a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO2 air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO2 (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material. ""This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity,"" explains Professor Keith. A report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology explains ""nearly all current research on carbon capture and storage (CCS) focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources such as power plants. Such plans usually entail separating CO2 from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to be stored underground."" Should North American governments invest in bringing this technology to market? Using CO2 air capture technology, ""a company could, in principle, contract with an oil sands plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it's cheapest — China, for example — and the same amount of CO2 would be removed,"" says Professor Keith in a UofC press release. ""While it's important to get started doing things we know how to do, like wind power, nuclear power, and 'regular' carbon capture and storage,"" Professor Keith continues, ""it's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem."" ISEEE's Executive Director David Layzell points out that ""energy-efficient and cost-effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector, such as biofuels or electric vehicles."""
tech,"NASA has canceled today's early morning launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour because of a hydrogen fuel leak. The leak was discovered after NASA personnel began to fill Endeavour's external fuel tank. ""The official scrub time was 12:26 a.m. EDT. Launch teams began draining Endeavour's external fuel tank of its liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at 12:06 a.m.. Fueling was halted after the leak was detected near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate, or GUCP, which attached to the external tank at its intertank area,"" said NASA in a statement on their website. Launch for mission STS-127 was scheduled for 7:17 a.m. (EDT) on Saturday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If NASA fixes the problem in a reasonable period, the next window of opportunity for launch would be at 6:51 a.m Sunday morning. If the problem cannot be solved by then, NASA says the earliest they would be able to re-schedule Endeavor's lift off would be June 17. This would conflict with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)/Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) launch. Space Shuttle Discovery will be on standby in case of emergencies and STS-128 could be readied to launch by August 6. A similar problem in March forced NASA to push back the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery for mission STS-119. The problem was fixed and Discovery was able to take off. Mission STS-127 is the 32nd flight dedicated to the International Space Station construction, and the final of a series of three flights dedicated to the assembly of the Japanese Kibo laboratory complex. The STS-127 payload is the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility and Experiment Logistics Module Exposed Section. The mission is scheduled to last sixteen days. This trip marks the first time that thirteen people will be on the ISS at the same time. Canada will see two astronauts in space simultaneously, also a first for the nation. Crew members listed to be part of the mission are Commander Mark Polansky, Pilot Doug Hurley, astronauts Wolf, Christopher Cassidy, Canadian Space Agency's mission specialist Julie Payette, and mission specialists Tom Marshburn and Tim Kopra."
tech,"A sudden cold snap across Europe caused a surge in demand for electricity. Two high voltage power lines in Germany failed. This triggered a cascade of cuts as automatic safety devices cut millions of customers in order to prevent a total blackout of the continent. Parts of Germany, Belgium, France (including parts of Paris), Spain, and Italy were affected. High speed railways were also impacted. Power was restored within two hours. Later reports said that Austria and Croatia were also affected. An alternative cause has been suggested; that the opening of the Ems powerline crossing to let a ship pass may have triggered the blackout. A senior director with French power company RTE is reported as saying ""We weren't very far from a European blackout"". After 13 years of isolation, Southeast Europe (including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia and Romania) were reconnected to the main European transmission system in November 2004. Now, with 400 million users, the European electrical transmission system has become, in terms of consumption, the world's largest electrical energy system.

The hacker and self-described ""troll"" was convicted of conspiracy to unlawfully access AT&amp;T's servers and identity theft by federal jury in November 2012 by a New Jersey court under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Co-defendant Daniel Spitler plead guilty. Spitler discovered AT&amp;T had inadvertently made data publicly available through their website, and wrote a script allowing him to obtain the email addresses of approximately 120,000 customers, including that of then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Auernheimer passed this information to Gawker, who published a redacted version. The three judges on the Philadelphia-based court, in a unanimous decision, ruled the New Jersey courtroom was an inappropriate venue for the initial trial. Michael Chagares, circuit judge, wrote ""the improper venue here—far from where he performed any of his allegedly criminal acts—denied Auernheimer's substantial right to be tried in the place where his alleged crime was committed"". The court said the issue represented a basic constitutional right and not a mere technicality. Prosecutors argued that approximately 4,500 of the affected users lived in New Jersey and the state was therefore a valid place for the trial, but the court noted neither the servers accessed, nor the Gawker reporter, nor the defendants, were based in that state. Auernheimer's attorney, Tor Ekeland, said that the government was ""trying to find courts that are favourable to them""."

tech,"NASA diagram of Voyager 1 entering the heliosheath region The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977 to explore the planets, is now agreed by scientists to have entered the heliosheath at the edge of the solar system 8.7 billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from the Sun. In a few years, Voyager 1 is expected to become the first man-made object to cross into interstellar space. ""Voyager has entered the final lap on its race to the edge of interstellar space, as it begins exploring the solar system's final frontier,"" said Dr. Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist at the California Institute of Technology. As long ago as 2003, scientists thought Voyager 1 was entering the termination shock region of the solar system, but there was some dispute. The termination shock is the area preceding the heliosheath, where the electrically charged solar wind is slowed and concentrated by contact with interstellar gas. The heliosheath is considered the outer edge of our solar system. Around it is the heliopause, a cosmic bubble where the pressure of solar wind and interstellar wind is in balance. NASA image of cover of the Voyager Golden Record The solar system as a whole is in orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. As it plows through clouds of interstellar gas and dust, a bow shock forms ahead of it, which has been compared to the turbulence a ship creates as it sails through ocean currents. All this is illustrated in the NASA diagram shown here. Voyager 1 is still operational and sending back reams of scientific data. Already notable for more than 27 years of successful operation, Voyager 1 is projected to continue operating on its plutonium power source possibly until the year 2020. Voyager 2, its companion probe launched the same year, has visited more planets than any other spacecraft. It too is eventually expected to exit the solar system at a more downward angle, but is currently only 80% as far from the sun as Voyager 1. The Voyagers are not only gathering data about the cosmos, they are sending the greetings of the human world out to it. Each Voyager contains what is known as the ""Voyager Golden Record"", which is an audio recording on a 12-inch gold plated copper disc. The discs contain samples of nature sounds, spoken greetings in 55 human languages, and musical compositions. The collection of samples was supervised by astronomer Carl Sagan, and is intended to convey the hopefulness of life on Earth for possible discovery by alien races or retrieval by some advanced human civilization."

tech,"NASA has announced that the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-122, will once again be postponed, this time until late January or early February. The reason behind the delay is believed to be a faulty connector that caused erratic fuel sensor readings during the previous two launch attempts in December. Space shuttle program manager Wayne Hale gave January 24 as the earliest possible launch date, but stated that February would be a more realistic expectation. ""I think it's much more likely that we'll be going to be ready somewhere in the February 2 to 7 time frame, given that we don't have any more findings as we go through our testing,"" Hale stated. The initial launch date for the shuttle was December 6, but failed fuel gauges in the external tank forced the launch to be moved to December 9. The fuel sensors are part of a system to prevent the shuttle from running on an empty tank, which could cause pumps in the engine of break and possibly trigger a disastrous explosion. When the problem reoccurred, NASA ran a fuel test, which led them to believe the problem lied in the faulty connector. The connector was then removed from the tank and taken to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, where it is currently undergoing extensive analysis and modification. The new connector is scheduled to be installed by January 10. ""What we're doing ... is addressing what we think is the most probable cause, and there's a lot of information that points to that connector and that this is the right design fix,"" deputy space shuttle program manager John Shannon said. ""We're fairly confident that if the problem is where we think it is, that this will solve that."" The main objective of mission STS-122 is to deliver the European science laboratory Columbus to the International Space Station."
tech,"space On Monday, astronomers at the Ohio State University, Columbus, revealed the discovery of an exoplanet, named KELT-9b and according to the university's astronomy professor Scott Gaudi, it is ""the hottest gas giant planet that has ever been discovered"". The discovery was reported online in the Nature journal. The astronomers say the planet's surface temperature is more than 4000°C (7232°F), nearly as hot as the Sun. The planet takes about 36 to 48 hours to orbit around its star, KELT-9. KELT-9 is about two and a half times larger than the Sun and nearly twice its temperature. The star is about 650 light years from the earth, but it is about 300 million years old. KELT-9 is a blue A-type star, which shines brightly but, unlike some other stars such as our own Sun, their life span is on the order of millions rather than billions of years. About a year ago, NASA reports, at the Winer Observatory in Arizona, observers using the KELT-North telescope noticed a minute drop in KELT-9's brightness &amp;mdash; about 0.5%. This pattern was observed once every one and a half days, implying the planet comes in between the line of sight of the star from Earth, meaning the planet completes one revolution in that time period. Observations using the Hubble telescope could reveal whether the planet possesses a comet-like tail, which could help the astronomers estimate how long the planet may live. Professor Gaudi told the BBC the planet KELT-9b ""is about three times the mass of Jupiter and twice as big as Jupiter."" He said the team discovered the planet in 2014. He added, ""it took us this long to finally convince ourselves that this truly bizarre and unusual world was in fact a planet orbiting another star"". Much like the Moon is to the Earth, KELT-9b is tidally locked to its star; with one side of the planet always exposed to its star. Due to tidal locking, the planet's surface temperature facing the star is roughly 4300°C (7772°F), more than the surface temperature of an average Red Dwarf star. Its close proximity to its parent star exposes it to ultraviolet radiation, and according to the calculations, the planet loses planetary material anywhere between ten billion to ten trillion grams each second. Professor Gaudi said, ""It's a planet by any of the typical definitions of mass, but its atmosphere is almost certainly unlike any other planet we've ever seen just because of the temperature of its dayside"". According to Keivan Stassun, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, ""KELT-9 will swell to become a red giant star in a few hundred million years"". Professor Stassun directed the study with Gaudi. The discovery was a collaboration between Ohio State University, Vanderbilt University, Lehigh University, and the South African Astronomical Observatory. They operate a dual-location system, one location in each hemisphere, called the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope. Professor Gaudi told the BBC that it was named ""as a joke"". headattrib=1clear"
tech,"Space The Space Shuttle Discovery successfully landed Wednesday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 11:57 AM EST (16:57 UTC) for what is scheduled to be the final time in its operational career. Upon landing, the shuttle and its six-person crew wrapped up the STS-133 mission, the Discoverys 39th and final flight into space. STS-133 launched on February 24, after several launch delays since last November due to numerous technical issues. During the twelve-day mission, the crew transported supplies and parts to the International Space Station (ISS) including Robonaut2, the first dexterous humanoid robot in space, the Permanent Multipurpose Module, and ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4. During the mission, two spacewalks were performed by astronauts Stephen Bowen and Alvin Drew to install parts and perform maintenance on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory. Six astronauts and cosmonauts, members of the Expedition 26 crew, remain aboard the ISS to carry out a long-duration mission aboard the outpost. STS-133 is Discoverys 39th and final mission into space, the 35th shuttle mission to the ISS, and the 133rd flight in the entire shuttle program. Discovery has docked with two different space stations, Mir and the ISS, and was the first shuttle to fly after both the Challenger and Columbia disasters. Discovery made its maiden flight on STS-41-D in 1984, having since become the most experienced and oldest surviving space shuttle, and delivering payloads to orbit such as the Hubble Space Telescope and becoming the first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut into space. Discovery, having completed its final flight, has been offered by NASA to the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., to display to the public. The museum, however, is in the process of determining how to obtain the funds necessary to transfer the shuttle. A decision regarding this possibility is expected to be made in April. A NASA commentator describes Wednesday's landing as ""the end of a historic journey. To a ship that has led the way, time and time again, we bid farewell to Discovery."" Two remaining shuttle flights are scheduled later this year, STS-134 and STS-135, before the retirement of the space shuttle fleet."
tech,"Pakistan The Pakistani government has temporarily blocked social networking website Twitter in relation to posts on the site promoting a Facebook contest involving drawings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The block was reportedly lifted after a few hours Sunday. Pakistan Telecommunication Authority chairman Muhammad Yaseen confirmed that the agency had managed to persuade social networking site Facebook to remove the postings from their site but said about Twitter: ""We have been negotiating with them until Saturday night, but they did not agree to remove the stuff, so we had to block it"". During the imposition of the block, Mohammad Younis Khan, a spokesperson for the agency, explained that while Facebook had ""agreed to remove the stuff"", Twitter was ""not responding to us."" The ""blasphemous material"" was placed by those organising the competition on Facebook in an attempt ""to hurt Muslim feelings"", according to Khan, who confirmed Sunday Twitter service had ""been restored"" on the orders given to the agency, although he did not know of any reason why this order had been made. Facebook has confirmed that material on its website had been made unavailable in Pakistan at the request of authorities, with a spokesperson for the website explaining: ""Out of respect for local laws, traditions and cultures, we may occasionally restrict certain content's visibility in the countries where it is illegal, as we have done in this case"". Twitter has not made any comment other than to clarify that no modifications or removals of content occurred to ensure the site's restoration. Human rights organisation Human Rights Watch's Pakistan director Ali Dayan Hasan condemned the Twitter block as ""ill-advised, counter-productive and will ultimately prove to be futile as all such attempts at censorship have proved to be"", while former United States Department of State spokesperson Philip J. Crowley described the decision as ""another sign of the civilian government's weakness"". This incident bears resemblance to one which occurred two years ago Saturday, when a court order blocked Facebook in the country for around two weeks due to a page on the site, called ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"", asking users to upload caricatures of Muhammad. In the Islam faith, depicting any prophet is prohibited as it is regarded as blasphemy."
tech,"Space The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found evidence of hydrated silica or opal, a form of mineral, over large areas in the Martian surface, including in the large martian canyon called Valles Marineris. The discovery was made by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) instrument on the orbiter. The findings are published by Ralph Milliken of Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other scientists in the November issue of the journal Geology. Opaline minerals were first found recently on Mars by Spirit rover in the Gusev crater. The present find points to more widespread occurrence of the minerals in comparatively younger strata of Mars. The find indicates that liquid water might have been present on the surface of Mars for a longer time than previously thought. The previous view was that liquid water disappeared from the Martian surface three billion years ago. Now it is estimated that water could have been present as late as two billion years ago. The presence of opal not only indicates water, but also that it was there long enough to alter some of the rocks. CRISM, which detected the mineral measures visible and infrared reflection spectra in 544 channels and has 20 times better resolution than previously deployed instruments. 4=Dr Scott Murchie, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Maryland Hydrated minerals such as opal that indicate presence of water is yet another evidence of presence of liquid water on Mars. Opal found on Earth's surface usually contain 3 &amp;ndash; 10% water, but can be as high as 20%. Other water-bearing minerals found earlier are phyllosilicates and hydrated sulfates. Presence of liquid water is also suggested by suspected water-sculpted land forms on Mars, such as gullies and river channels. Currently water is present only as ice at both polar caps of Mars. A number of outcrops of opaline minerals are found as thin layers over large distances, rimming the Valles Marineris canyon. It is expected that Martian explorations for past or present life will have to focus on similar younger terrains with hydrated minerals. ""This is an exciting discovery because it extends the time range for liquid water on Mars, and the places where it might have supported life,"" said Scott Murchie, from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, one of the co-authors."
tech,"Craigslist.com, a popular free online classifieds site, has been sued for hosting discriminatory housing ads by the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Inc., a fair housing group. The housing ads cited as objectionable included such statements as ""NO MINORITIES,"" ""Requirements: Clean Godly Christian Male,"" and ""Only Muslims apply."" Stephen Libowsky, a lawyer for the housing group, said ""Our goal is to have the Internet places like Craigslist treated no differently than newspapers and other media who have traditionally been posting real estate advertisements. All of the gains are going to get lost if the same rules don't apply."" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster conceded ""We admit that one or two postings per 100,000 are discriminatory"" but explained that Craiglist's 19 employees could not physically screen the 8 million new ads posted each month. He continued, ""Instead, we've done something much more powerful and effective, in providing our users with a flagging system whereby problematic ads are promptly removed by users themselves."" Buckaster claimed the ""NO MINORITIES"" ad was removed within two hours. Buckmaster wrote on the site that, ""Though well-intentioned, this lawsuit misguidedly demands that we regress to primitive, mistake-prone, and wholly inadequate methods, methods which would actually be less effective in catching discriminatory ads than what we have in place currently, and which would vastly reduce the number of legitimate non-discriminatory ads that the site could process."" He continued, ""Ironically, if this lawsuit were to succeed the net effect would be to deal a double blow to civil rights - by significantly reducing access to equal opportunity housing, and by undercutting our fundamental free speech rights - thereby doing a great disservice to the very persons these lawyers purport to represent."" Buckmaster also said ""It is our understanding that the law is very clear to the effect that sites like Craigslist cannot be held legally liable for the content of postings submitted by end users."" This claim appears based upon Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which states that ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Under section 7b of the web site's Terms of Service agreement, users are not allowed to post an ad ""that violates the Fair Housing Act by stating, in any notice or ad for the sale or rental of any dwelling, a discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (or violates any state or local law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of these or other characteristics)""."

tech,"SpaceDISPLAYTITLE:NASA's InSight lander and MarCO craft launch in new mission to Mars On Saturday, United Launch Alliance launched a Atlas V 401 rocket carrying NASA's InSight Mars lander and two Mars Cube One (MarCO) miniature spacecraft known as cubesats. The pre-dawn launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3E in Lompoc, California was declared a success. This was the very first deep space launch from the west coast of the United States, and aimed to send a lander to the surface of the planet Mars to study its interior. Launched alongside InSight were two MarCO cubesats, the first to be sent beyond Earth, nicknamed 'WALL-E' and 'Eve' after the protagonists of the 2008 animated science fiction film WALL-E. They were designed as a dual telecommunications relay for InSight during the spacecraft's descent through the Martian atmosphere. Traditionally, NASA launched interplanetary spacecraft at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the United States' east coast. There, rockets were sent eastward over the Atlantic Ocean, borrowing the Earth's rotational velocity to shoot their payloads out into the solar system. Due to congestion on the launch calendar at Canaveral, NASA chose to launch the spacecraft from from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the country's west coast instead. A launch eastward from Vandenberg would have been dangerous due to densely populated areas being located downrange. Instead, rockets launched from Vandenberg were sent in a south-southeast trajectory. For Insight and MarCO, the spacecraft was placed in a temporary polar orbit after the launch, with the pair being shot towards Mars during a escape burn performed over the North Pole. Despite a heavy fog settling in at the rocket's launch pad in Lompoc, the United Launch Alliance declared a ""100% chance of favorable weather for liftoff"". Spectators in Lompoc were treated to a mostly obscured view of the launch, though they were witness nonetheless to the sound and shock waves of the Atlas V's Common Core first stage as it lifted the spacecraft off the ground on-schedule at 4:05 PDT (1105 UTC). People along the coast of southern California and northern Baja California, however, were in clear view of the Atlas V's main engine burn and the first burn of the rocket's Centaur upper stage. People in Orange County, California were treated to the sight of InSight and the Centaur almost eclipsing the planet Jupiter in the night sky. The recently-inaugurated Administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, congratulated the InSight team in an address televised live on NASA TV after the launch, along with the United Launch Alliance on what was their 128th successful launch in a row. The InSight mission part of NASA's Discovery program, a class of low-cost solar system exploration missions. It was selected to launch in the program after beating the Comet Hopper and Titan Mare Explorer proposals amongst responses to a 2010 request. Both InSight and the MarCO cubesats are en route to Mars. InSight carries eight scientific instruments, including a seismometer known as Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS). The SEIS instrument will be recording the very first seismic measurements of Mars, which scientists hope will shed light on the structure of Mars beneath its surface. The lander was equipped with two cameras, based on the architecture of the Mars Exploration Rover's navigation camera and hazard avoidance camera, to allow mission scientists to monitor the activity of the instruments. NASA scheduled a November 26 landing for InSight on a broad plain in the planet's northern hemisphere, known as Elysium Planitia."

tech,"Mathematics Vinay Deolalikar, a mathematician who works for HP Labs, claims to have proven that P is not equal to NP. The problem is the greatest unsolved problem in theoretical computer science and is one of seven problems in which the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered million dollar prizes to the solutions. The question of whether P equals NP essentially asks whether there exist problems which take a long time to solve but whose solutions can be checked quickly. More formally, a problem is said to be in P if there is a program for a Turing machine, an ideal theoretical computer with unbounded amounts of memory, such that running instances of the problem through the program will always answer the question in polynomial time &amp;mdash; time always bounded by some fixed polynomial power of the length of the input. A problem is said to be in NP, if the problem can be solved in polynomial time when instead of being run on a Turing machine, it is run on a non-deterministic Turing machine, which is like a Turing machine but is able to make copies of itself to try different approaches to the problem simultaneously. Mathematicians have long believed that P does not equal NP, and the question has many practical implications. Much of modern cryptography, such as the RSA algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, rests on certain problems, such as factoring integers, being in NP and not in P. If it turned out that P=NP, these methods would not work but many now difficult problems would likely be easy to solve. If P does not equal NP then many natural, practical problems such as the traveling salesman problem are intrinsically difficult. In 2000, the Clay Foundation listed the ""Clay Millenium Problems,"" seven mathematical problems each of which they would offer a million dollars for a correct solution. One of these problems was whether P equaled NP. Another of these seven, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman who first made headlines for solving the problem and then made them again months later for refusing to take the prize money. On August 7, mathematician Greg Baker noted on his blog that he had seen a draft of a claimed proof by Deolalikar although among experts a draft had apparently been circulating for a few days. Deolalikar's proof works by connecting certain ideas in computer science and finite model theory to ideas in statistical mechanics. The proof works by showing that if certain problems known to be in NP were also in P then those problems would have impossible statistical properties. Computer scientists and mathematicians have expressed a variety of opinions about Deolalikar's proof, ranging from guarded optimism to near certainty that the proof is incorrect. Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has expressed his pessimism by stating that he will give $200,000 of his own money to Deolalikar if the proof turns out to be valid. Others have raised specific technical issues with the proof but noted that the proof attempt presented interesting new techniques that might be relevant to computer science whether or not the proof turns out to be correct. Richard Lipton, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech, has said that ""the author certainly shows awareness of the relevant obstacles and command of literature supporting his arguments."" Lipton has listed four central objections to the proof, none of which are necessarily fatal but may require more work to address. On August 11, 2010, Lipton reported that consensus of the reviewers was best summarized by mathematician Terence Tao, who expressed the view that Deolalikar's paper probably did not give a proof that P!=NP even after major changes, unless substantial new ideas are added."

tech,"IBM and Cisco have announced the development of a new platform, based on Eclipse and OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative), which should unite all communication and collaboration software developers under a single platform. Before the UC2 (Unified Communication and Collaboration) the unified communication has suffered because of a lack of a platform to be used by all software developers, rather than a series of them and, moreover, provided by different vendors. According to Adam Gartenberg from IBM Lotus Software Group this was the main cause for this partial stagnation. However, the UC2 is meant to ease the work of software developers. Gartenberg stated that this platform is very flexible and will certainly draw much attention form programmers. They will be able to create different plug-ins and small applications to remotely control other, major application. The companies have also unveiled a series of their other joint projects. These project will be based on a set of application programming interface from Lotus (SameTime) and Cisco. The add-ons planned are integration of a series of additional functions and features into the SameTime software from Lotus. Thus, in a few months, the SameTime users will benefit from such functions as click-to-call and voicemail. This will enable easier instant messaging inside the Cisco's Unified IP phones' system. The fact that the platform will be based on Eclipse will make the numerous developers create many communications services, mainly for remote users to benefit from a series of new functions of ERP and CRM applications. Nortel Networks - a partner of Microsoft since last year and Cisco's rival in the area - didn't have much success in the communication services field. As for Microsoft, the experts are waiting for the reaction of the Bill Gates' company on the ideas and offers made by IBM and Cisco for enterprise communications and collaboration solutions."

tech,"Space NASA's IBEX (or Interstellar Boundary Explorer) satellite, released into orbit last October, has provided the data for the first ""all sky map"" showing the boundary between the Solar System and Interstellar Space. IBEX mapped the sky using two sensors, gathering information about the particle structure within the Milky Way. This map should help researchers better understand relationships between the Sun and our Galaxy. The particles which IBEX looks for are energetic neutral atoms, atoms with a neutral charge that release large amounts of energy in most directions. The best place to find these particles is in the Sun's Heliosphere, where forces from outside our solar system interact with the Sun's magnetic field, causing these particles to become highly energetic. Two sensors on IBEX detect and catalog this. After six months of repeating this cycle over the entire night sky, IBEX acquired enough data to create the all sky map. This map goes beyond the capacities of the Voyager missions, giving an insight into the Sun's interaction with the rest of the galaxy. As Cosmic rays approach the solar system, the heliosphere prevents them from crossing into the heart of the solar system, thereby effectively stopping these harmful rays from reaching Earth. This new energy is released from electrically neutral atoms, and when scientists look at the energy given off by these atoms they have a general view of what energy is coming from what area. Knowing the place in the galaxy where certain rays come from help scientists understand the way our galaxy functions, from star positioning to globular clusters. ""For the first time, we're sticking our heads out of the sun's atmosphere and beginning to really understand our place in the galaxy,"" said David J. Comas of NASA."

For most core developers the typical day is probably a day off, though, as we work on Minetest when we have free time and feel like it. WNIQ Tell me, what are some of the design decisions that you are not happy about? Perttu Ahola There are none, all of them were required to get where we are now. I think you should never blame a design decision that got you somewhere. WNIQ Okay. How does the developer team decide on the design-decisions and feature requests for the game? Perttu Ahola I have written some blog posts and roadmaps about my vision, and the team is free to either pick from there or simply do anything they think is important. The core team mostly deals with engine things, and feature requests often come from modders. Dealing with game design feature requests is really difficult so we've tried to move them out of the engine and into the independent game content. Most features are accepted as long as they're simply and nicely done and it's obvious players or modders will find use for them. The team will ask from me if they're unsure about something. It doesn't often happen, but they're free to do it and I take the responsibility in that case. This also applies if there's a conflict between team members. WNIQ Conflict between the team members? How often is there a conflict between team members? And how do you resolve it? Perttu Ahola I'm not sure it has ever really happened. It's not as exciting as it sounds. But in that case I get to be the dictator. :-) WNIQ What accomplishment are you most proud of? Perttu Ahola I think it's the initial decision to start the project. Everything is based on that, after all. Maybe also the fact that probably like 50% of Minecraft clones on Google Play are Minetest forks, many of which are at least slightly illegal. WNIQ Looking back at the 9&amp;ndash;10 years of this project, what are some of the excellent moments/milestones that stand out? Perttu Ahola The initial 0.4 development in late 2011 and early 2012 was an exciting time. One of the contributors at the time helped me a lot in getting it done, he was quite capable and enjoyable to work with. It felt a bit like a ""dream team"". Some persons in the Minetest team are quite anonymous, including this one &amp;mdash; I never learned their real life identity. There was a take over attempt of the project in 2017 by an individual who until then seemed like a contributor with good intentions. It was quite the time too. I don't want to give any publicity to him though, as he's still trying to do it. I don't know if I'd call it excellent, but it definitely comes to mind as something that happened. During the past few years Minetest has had some physical presence in Europe. A couple of core developers and community members organized a stall at the Freenode #live event in 2017 and 2018. I guess I have to say I'm not that good at remembering milestones though. I'm sure many people have their own memories about Minetest's history. Many remember their first server that they played on, for example &amp;mdash; my perspective on the other hand is in development. In development, it's a good thing I don't remember much because that means everything has gone rather smoothly. WNIQ Have you been to Freenode #live events? Perttu Ahola I haven't been to Freenode #live. I don't tend to travel that far, I feel international travel is too much hassle and I'm not a very social person at all. WNIQ Do you or any of the Minetest developers attend LibrePlanet, FOSDEM or other conferences too? Perttu Ahola I haven't been following too closely, but as they're open source developers and many live in central Europe, you might stumble upon them in events around there. They might be in a disguise, though, as they are involved in other projects in addition to Minetest. Rubenwardy (one of the core developers) has said he wants a Minetest convention and I have to go. We'll see if that happens, and where if so. WNIQ Ah, that would be interesting. Does Rubenwardy have any places in mind? What do you think of organising it in Helsinki? Perttu Ahola As most core developers and contributors come from Germany, France, UK and such, I think Helsinki wouldn't make that much sense. During Minetest's history, there haven't been almost any Finnish developers other than me. And, given that I live half a thousand kilometers away from Helsinki, it's not exactly my home town either. It's a very international project. WNIQ How do you and Minetest benefit from the presence at freenode? Apart from the platform features, do you also benefit from links with members of other channels at Freenode? Perttu Ahola Freenode doesn't really link projects together, it mostly works as a private platform for discussions for each project. Of course it's easy to join if you're already on some other Freenode channels, as many open source developers are. WNIQ Apart from freenode, how do the developers meet with other developers? Do they use online text or video chat, or do they also have meet-ups in-person? Perttu Ahola I hear people using mostly IRC, Github and the forum. There's some development talk on the unofficial discord server too. I rarely hear about IRL meet-ups. I've only ever met one Minetest contributor who was visiting Oulu with a group to see the midnight sun which happens this time of the year here in the north. WNIQ What is planned for the next versions? Perttu Ahola I and many of our core developers have big plans but we're a bit lazy and have many projects going on so it's really up to who has a spare week here and there and what kind of new contributions are coming in. We have a history of not ending up even close to what the roadmap was telling us to do. On a weekly basis we do have a continuous flow of fixes and new modding API features going into the engine, so there's always something around the corner. In addition to that, an interesting place to be on the lookout is the modding sections of our forum. Those guys get to use much more imagination than the core engine developers. It's been long in the plans to get more imaginative content into the main Minetest release, but currently it's still kind of boring, so make sure to check out the forum and content database. WNIQ What are some of the upcoming milestones for Minetest? Perttu Ahola We're moving release by release and including stuff on a when-it's-ready basis. Version 5.3 will be coming out very soon as there are just some bugs left. It's ended up with 50 commits. That's mostly bugfixes, but to pick a feature, the ""minimal development test"" game that comes with engine for mod and engine developing purposes has been rethought and overhauled. What'll end up in 5.4 is still completely open. In my experience setting any milestones you're not doing yourself is never a good idea in a hobby project &amp;mdash; it'll just intimidate people and nothing gets done. Some developers have big plans, including myself, but they may or may not happen. :-) WNIQ How is the i18n internationalisation support for Minetest? Do you plan on supporting more languages? Perttu Ahola There are some challenges due to the fact that Minetest supports multiplayer servers with each client using their own language settings, but if you choose your mods carefully, you can get a single player experience in many, many languages. You can check out the translation status for different languages at Weblate. You can also contribute translations right there on that website. We occasionally update the English versions and occasionally copy the translated texts over to the project to be included in releases. Many open source projects do it like this, we're no different. Currently it looks like 11 languages have 90% of texts translated. More than 90%, I mean. Of course with game content, especially that which you find separately, your mileage will vary &amp;mdash; but the engine translations are enough to configure Minetest and get you into a game world. It's an ongoing process to try to make everything we can translatable by the community. WNIQ Okay. Do you also plan on providing more biomes, or making the current ones more interesting? Perttu Ahola We've long been in the process of moving the game content out of the engine and away from the core team more to individual game-focused developers, so the default game content has been a bit boring. However, you don't need to live with it, as it's easily solved: just download some biomes you like into your game. At this point it's not really even intended to be used as-is. It's the core idea of Minetest 0.4, and from there on all subsequent versions. Content is so easy to add and modify that it doesn't really even matter what content you start from. If you want a fleshed out product with everything in there out of the box, Minetest doesn't really do that. But you can search on our forums or content database if there's something that would do it for you &amp;mdash; some game packages are quite complete. WNIQ What are some of the reasons people choose Minecraft over Minetest? What are some of the common complaints you hear about the game? Perttu Ahola I think most of the time people don't like Minetest because they want a full game that they can just play. On the other hand other people choose Minetest because they don't want that, they want something they can easily customize. Some don't like how Minetest looks, to the experienced eye the graphics aren't as polished. However it does run on older hardware. People using older hardware often choose Minetest because it works much better. On the other hand, Minetest can't utilize high end gaming PCs as well, it's not optimized for those. Of course also the price differentiates the two. Minecraft costs a lot, especially if you're a kid in a poor country, or you want to install it on every computer in the classroom, or even an entire school. But for the money you're getting a fleshed out product. For some use cases you can't beat that. WNIQ Will the improvement in the graphics of the game compromise with the advantage of the game running on older hardware? Is it possible to achieve both without any compromises? Perttu Ahola Improvement in graphics will compromise the advantage of being able to run on old hardware, or it will result in basically two separate rendering engines. To take advantage of new hardware you have to switch to newer versions of OpenGL, heavily use shaders and such, and as a result old hardware simply grinds to a halt or simply doesn't support those. Of course some improvement can be done without compromise, but it's relatively minor if you look at what gamers are expecting these days. On the other hand for use by kids or education or such, looks don't really matter. What matters is that it's able to run on the hardware they happen to have. WNIQ Would you want to create two different engines for those players who have new hardware and want to enjoy the open-source game? Perttu Ahola Maybe, but I'm not the one to do it. High-end graphics is quite a specialized field and it's especially specialized when you want to render a voxel world like this, with voxel-based lighting and whatnot. For more common types of game environments you could use more easy-to-use solutions. WNIQ What contributors are the most wanted at the moment? What activities are in dire need of more eyeballs and helping hands? Perttu Ahola Any kind of contribution is always welcome. I don't think I'm in a position to pick and choose what people spend their time on. If you contribute something because it's important to you, it's going to be important to some others too. I also can't pick and choose what skills people have. If you are a capable programmer and for some crazy reason have lots of free time that you don't know what to do with, you can absolutely trust me and other core developers to give you things to do for the rest of your life. But that's not how it works, nobody is like that. You do what you like and what you feel is important. You will be thanked by the users. On the off chance that I can get a programmer inspired to do something for us: We've been long thinking of Voxel Area Entities &amp;mdash; basically objects that are built from the same blocks that the world is, but that can move within the world based on some kind of moddable logic, like physics. Every year I'm asked by a different person when I'm going to do it, and every year I've had some other project I'm focusing on. Most core developers don't feel they have what it takes to even try doing that. Other massive ideas floating in the air in the Minetest developer community, core developers and contributors alike, is abstracting away and switching the rendering engine to something more modern, probably something made by us to fit the needs of Minetest instead of some generic game graphics engine. WNIQ For how long do you see yourself continuing to work as the CEO of the project? Perttu Ahola Until I'm dead, probably. Not because I really want to, but because it's not something anyone else wants to do. What would you choose, going on the beach, pub or golf field to take it easy, or staying in your basement looking through issues and pull requests, thinking when you're going to upgrade the forum software, trying to figure out why something was implemented in some way in the code, writing about some idea you have that hasn't still been implemented in seven years? See, I'm absolutely crazy. Most people aren't. It's actually an interesting question: Is there any way I could be replaced? WNIQ Is there a way to? Perttu Ahola I do think some parts of Minetest have been made as student projects. Such extra motivation helps getting things done. Maybe a tech leadership school could take Minetest CEO as a student project position? Like, do it for a year and get lots of points. Just an idea I guess. Also, I kind of hate the subject. In that way I'm more of a CTO Chief Technical Officer than a CEO. WNIQ Do you think Minetest can benefit from programmes such as Google Summer of Code? Perttu Ahola Maybe, but it's difficult to compete with other projects there and the person doing it has to already be a contributor with a task in mind. Otherwise it takes way too much prepping work to get somebody going in anything larger. Self motivation is key in getting something done in a project like this. Nobody will make you do anything or guide you. You have to want to do it, and ask for help. We also don't have any centralized official organization in any country, so we can't really collect funds and pay people to do things. Money, official forms, agreements &amp;mdash; No thanks. Throw it in the trash. Our agreement is the LGPL license of the code and CC BY-SA of other assets &amp;mdash; it's the bare minimum and works. Enrolling Minetest into GSoC could be the contribution of someone. I don't think there's anything stopping that. It could be quite beneficial to the project. WNIQ How can the community ensure that the Minetest project succeeds for the foreseeable future? Perttu Ahola Use it, teach other people how to use it, share your in-game and mod creations with other people. Of course reporting and fixing bugs and contributing engine features helps, but the main reason it exists is because it has users that enjoy playing it. Whether something is a ""thing"" really only depends on whether it's popular. WNIQ When did you actually think Minetest was getting significant attention and it was getting popular?' Perttu Ahola When I started posting about it on the Irrlicht forums and other places on the 'net, it immediately became obvious there was interest for such a thing. I mean, compared to Minecraft, it has always been tiny. But it was something completely different to anything else I had published until then in terms of public interest. It wasn't just one person saying they checked it out. It easily created a thread with people arguing whether it was even legal to make one like it. WNIQ The legal aspect is something even I wondered about. But you haven't received any legal notices, right? Perttu Ahola Well, it might have not been obvious then that it is legal, but nowadays there are so many Minecraft-like games everywhere people don't even think about it any more. Nothing at all, ever. And why would I get a legal notice? &amp;mdash; it's completely made from scratch and I've never seen any Minecraft source code. That wouldn't be the reason I'd change the name. But changing the name isn't really doable. You could of course publish it in addition under a second name and leave the engine called Minetest. But what's the point? Minetest is such a bad name it works as a trademark in itself. Nobody wants to copy it. It doesn't sell, but we don't need to sell. If it was a serious commercial endeavour I would never had named it that in the first place. A trademark lawsuit would only make Minetest grossly more popular, and we could simply change the name. Really nothing is stopping us, if we need to, but there's not really any need. WNIQ What are some of your other hobbies? Perttu Ahola In addition to programming I also do electronics as a hobby. I'm very interested in electric vehicle EV conversions and have done some reverse engineering for re-using parts from crashed EVs. Some of that has been released as open source. Well, in addition to having them as hobbies, I also work in programming and electronics. But anyway &amp;mdash; whether money is involved or not, that's what I do. I've also tried to do some other game development. That was more of a learning experience than something that would have resulted in an end product. WNIQ What sport activities do you normally undertake to stay strong and healthy? How has the pandemic affected them? Perttu Ahola I'm not a very sporty person. If I feel so, I'll go for a walk or ride to town and back with my bicycle. I do try to eat quite healthy though. The pandemic hasn't had much effect on my life overall. I've just shifted from less remote work to more remote work. WNIQ What are some of the important things your have learned as an open-source game developer? Perttu Ahola Well, most game ideas suck, and the programming doesn't really matter. Game development isn't something I'd recommend for anyone, it's such a saturated field. WNIQ Saturated field? Perttu Ahola I mean, too many people are making games already. It's such a popular hobby. WNIQ Well those were all the questions I had for you. Perttu Ahola (That was quite a lot of questions, I think that'd make a small book so far. :-)) WNIQ Anything you would like to add? Perttu Ahola I don't think so. WNIQ Thank you so much, being so generous with your time, celeron55. It was wonderful discussing about Minetest with you! Perttu Ahola No problem, it's not too often I answer so much things about my longest ever project. HYS"
tech,"Turkey Kurdish Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, was promoted this week with a reception in Diyarbakir. Ubuntu was the first Linux distribution to implement Kurdish localization . Kurdish localization in Linux is an important milestone for Turkey due to ethnic conflicts. Kurdish Ubuntu was prepared by a team of hardworking translators working on the Rosetta web application . In his talk at the reception, the mayor of Sur (a town in Diyarbakir) said that ""Whatever language it is in, we wanted it our service to be accessible multilingually because multilingualism is our wealth. Our work is being conducted on Kurdish, English, and Turkish language support. ... If we can integrate multilingualism, multi-identities, and multi-culturalism in this nation, this region will be a place of peace instead of conflicts."" Mehmed Uzun, a Kurdish writer, speaking about the Kurdish language, told the attendees that ""Our most important problem is that the language is not standardized. The Kurdish language should be standardized."" Ubuntu was later distributed to the reception's attendees.

tech,"Space Space transport services company SpaceX launched their fifth Dragon resupply vehicle to the International Space Station yesterday. The spacecraft &amp;mdash; containing more than 2,200kg (5,000 pounds) of food, experiments, and spare parts &amp;mdash; successfully decoupled from the launch rocket and should reach the station early tomorrow. The launch was postponed from Tuesday because of a technical issue on the second stage of the rocket. The shipment includes replacements for cargo aboard the spaceship Cygnus, destroyed during a failed launch in October. Cygnus belonged to the rival Orbital Sciences Corporation. SpaceX tried unsuccessfully to land the Falcon 9 delivery rocket for reuse. The rocket reached an unmanned barge in the Atlantic, but landed too hard. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said the landing ""bodes well for the future, though"". The attempted salvage of the rocket was experimental, using new retractable fins. Next time they will add extra hydraulic fluid, Musk said. The ship's support equipment was damaged but, according to Musk, the barge is intact. Last year saw two successful SpaceX splashdowns but landing on such a small target as a ship is unique."
tech,"WikimediaMention Internet users on the Chinese-forums.com website report that the longtime block of Wikipedia by China has been at least temporarily lifted. Absent an announcement from the Chinese government, it's unclear what the conditions were that caused the site to be accessible from within China. A blog by Wikipedia contributor Andrew Lih says that someone in ""Beijing emailed me saying he could suddenly start using Wikipedia again. Some folks in Hubei said it was still blocked. Shanghai and Guangdong users said parts were accessible."" He continued that ""from a Beijing China Netcom's residential DSL connection, the English language and other foreign language versions are now accessible, but the Chinese version is still blocked"", noting that the Chinese-language version is the most important one to most Wikipedians in the country. The blog entry goes on to explain the finer points of China's blocking system, which is more complex than most media outlets suggest. Wikimedia head Jimmy Wales told Moneycontrol.com yesterday that, ""We don't know what they took offense to. We really don't intend to compromise the way Google did. We also feel that the block is an error. I am trying to set up high-level meetings in China to state our case and explain why we should be unblocked. We have no idea what the result of that would be. But we are somewhat hopeful. Wikipedia is not a haven for dissidents but an encyclopedia. About 99.9 percent of Wikipedia has topics that are not of interest to the Chinese Government. There is no political component. We are hopeful that they can see the point."" He also told the outlet, he stressed how such bans were blocking Chinese perspectives in the global media. ""The Chinese people would like to contribute to Wikipedia to give the Chinese point of view for the entire world to see. And China needs to be better understood by the rest of the world."" The third block of Wikipedia, which was implemented 19 October 2005, was issued without explanation or an expected length. Wikipedia has been blocked twice before, the first from 2-21 June 2004, due to the 15th anniversary of the Tian'anmen Square Incident. A website called baidu.com runs a self-censored wiki-based encyclopedia website, called baidubaike.com, launched in April of this year. Wikipedia is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. Its 2007 annual convention, Wikimania, is set to take place in Taipei."

All other countries (except Germany, where a similar dispute also resulted in a name change) will continue to use the Gmail name and domain (gmail.com).

tech,"0 A.D. is a historical, open source, strategy game, published by Wildfire Games. It focuses on the period between 500BC and 500AD. The game will be released in two parts: the first covering the pre-AD period, and the second running to 500AD. With development well underway, Wikinews interviewed the development team. Aviv Sharon, a 24-year-old Israeli student responsible for the project's PR, compiled the below Q&amp;A, which the full team approved prior to publication. Baptiste Domps Could you introduce the development team of 0 A.D. ? Aviv SharonWe are Wildfire Games, a group of approximately 15-20 people from around the world developing 0 A.D., a free, open-source game of ancient warfare. Cumulatively, about 100 different people have contributed to 0 A.D. over time. Our ages have ranged from 15 to 65 and our locations range from North America and Europe to India and New Zealand. The contributions to 0 A.D. are coordinated by a team of department heads led by a lead producer, Erik Johansson (feneur), who is 25 years old from Sweden. BD Who are the participants ? Salarieds or benevolents ? ASAll contributions to 0 A.D. so far have been on a voluntary basis only. To speed up development, however, we have decided to raise enough money to support 160 hours of paid development of the 0 A.D. codebase. We have tentatively selected the team member who will receive this compensation, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh), but decided to hold off for a few months until we start using these funds to wait until he has more time to dedicate to 0 A.D. development. Otherwise, 0 A.D. development will continue to be voluntary, and all funds donated to 0 A.D. will be used for team expenses only, such as website hosting costs. BD Why did you want to make games? ASThere are several different reasons. Originally, 0 A.D. was born out of a desire to innovate within the RTS genre. We felt, and still feel, that this genre has a lot of potential for innovation and we wish to explore that with some different rules. 0 A.D. started out as a total conversion mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, until team members at that time ran into the limitations of changing a closed-source game. Hence, as a wish to break free from the limitations of other games' engines, the standalone version of 0 A.D. was conceived and its development continues to this day. Some other reasons include a deep appreciation of ancient history; the wish to improve our skills and be recognized for our talents; and a determination to prove that a group of volunteers collaborating over the internet can make a game that rivals the commercial, proprietary AAA titles. BD Why did you choose a free license? ASPeople are spending more money, time and attention on playing computer games than ever before, and games are constantly evolving into a more nuanced medium of expression and a greater part of our culture. Just observe how much people play on Facebook and their mobile devices. We think this culture should allow gamers to learn how their games work, change them, share them and redistribute their works. This freedom to tinker is what Free, Open-Source Software (FOSS) is all about and so we hope a lot of people tinker with 0 A.D. BD How do you coordinate ? What technical and financial resources has 0 A.D.? ASWe mostly coordinate over a forum system we have, as well as a Trac system for task management and technical documentation. We also conduct discussions over IRC (#0ad and #0ad-dev on QuakeNet), that get more concentrated on the weekend, and Saturday afternoon in particular, when we have our weekly meeting. BD Which type of participants do you need? 'Amateurs' can they participate? ASAmateurs can definitely help with tasks like documentation and spreading the word about 0 A.D. For other tasks, we do require some prior knowledge in fields such as software development, 3d animation etc. Our main personnel needs are in three fields: Programmers, artists and sound people. We have many applicants for sound contributors but need a manager to oversee them. For programming we need capable gameplay, AI, sound and graphics programmers, proficient in C++ and/or JavaScript. Finally, in the art department, we could use some more texture artists, 3D artists, animators, and illustrators to draw 2d icons for the game's user interface. BD It's been 10 years since 0 A.D. is developing, what obstacles have arisen and how have you resolved? ASThe biggest obstacle we have run into is underestimating the scale and complexity of an RTS game. When embarking upon this journey in 2001, nobody thought that completing this endeavor would take this long. Evidently, making an RTS game requires a great deal of programming features, art assets and more. And, as we discovered the hard way, the first draft of anything is seldom good enough. For example, one of the most important engine components, named ""Simulation"", was simply planned wrong the first time around. Simulation is in charge of changing the state of each entity in the ""world"" represented in the game, like handling harvesting resources, doing damage to stuff and handling death. Sadly, over time it got implemented in such a haphazard way it devolved into an unstable, unpredictable ball of mud. Debugging became difficult and attracting new programmers from joining the development effort became impossible. Over time, fewer and fewer developers stayed on with 0 A.D. and it seemed as if the project was in grave danger of ending, the way many initiatives on the internet spontaneously do. Thankfully, one of our programmers, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh) from the UK, fixed this situation almost singlehandedly over the course of a few months in 2009-2010. Ever since simulation was fixed, it's been smoother sailing and the pace of development picked up considerably. We have recruited several programmers and are constantly adding new features, most recently a prototype opponent AI, which is a big milestone for us. BD What are you proudest of about your game? We are proud of the way our fans go ""wow"" over screenshots, in-game videos and their direct experiences with the game. We get comments like, ""It's like Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and Rise of Nations had a baby and it came out free!"" and ""This can't be open source. It rocks too much!"". We're proud we've built a community of enthusiasts on our forums, Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere, and continuously generated some buzz around 0 A.D. We hope to justify this hype and lead the project to completion. Does this look like a game you would be interested in playing? BD What is the schedule for 2011? ASOne big upcoming feature is random map scripting, which allows for much more variety in gameplay without having to manually draw new maps all the time. Our prototype opponent AI is set to get even smarter at all aspects of gameplay, and, with time, will be able to execute any of a variety of strategies to win the game. However, generally speaking, we don't make long-term plans because they never seem to work out. So far, since August 2010 we have released an alpha version every 70 days on average, and we intend to keep releasing more alpha versions until the game is feature-complete. Then we will enter a beta phase, playtest and fix bugs until a point when we decide the game is done, hopefully sometime in 2012."
tech,"WikimediaMention Jimbo Wales is teaming up with book publisher Tim O'Reilly to create a ""code of conduct"" for bloggers. The code is expected to address issues of free speech and the practice of allowing mean-spirited comments made by users to remain in the blogosphere. It will also address a perceived need to delete posted comments, particularly those by anonymous users, that are at odds with the code of conduct. Under consideration is the question of whether it is an admissible action in a public forum to delete a comment if it meets one of several objectionable reasons for removing it. ""That is one of the mistakes a lot of people make, believing that uncensored speech is the most free when in fact, managed civil dialogue is actually the freer speech,"" said O'Reilly. Some of the proposed rules of the code, as it is being discussed, might include: *We are committed to the ""Civility Enforced"" standard: we will not post unacceptable content, and we'll delete comments that contain it. *We define unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that: :*- is being used to abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others :*- is libelous, knowingly false, ad-hominem, or misrepresents another person, :*- infringes upon a copyright or trademark :*- violates an obligation of confidentiality :*- violates the privacy of others The code is a draft proposal undergoing development at Wikia, a privately held web hosting company founded by Wales and Angela Beesley. ""If it's a carefully constructed set of principles, it could carry a lot of weight even if not everyone agrees,"" said Wales. The reception of the code is mixed, but there are many bloggers who feel that such a code of conduct would reduce the effects of unpleasant or malicious speech. ""I’ve been assaulted and harassed online for four years,"" Richard Silverstein of richardsilverstein.com said. ""Most of it I can take in stride. But you just never get used to that level of hatred."""
tech,"Crime and lawMassachusetts-based First Amendment rights lawyer Marc Randazza is defending a controversial parody website which satirizes American political commentator Glenn Beck. The website was created in September by a man from Florida named Isaac Eiland-Hall, and it asserts Beck uses questionable tactics ""to spread lies and misinformation"". The website created by Eiland-Hall is located at the domain name ""www.GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com"". Its premise is derived from a joke statement made by Gilbert Gottfried about fellow comedian Bob Saget. The joke was first applied to Beck on the Internet discussion community Fark. It then became popular on Internet social media sites including Reddit and Digg, and was the subject of a Google bomb, a technique where individuals link phrases in order to artificially change Google search results. Eiland-Hall saw the discussion on Fark, and created a website about it. The website asserts it does not believe the rumors to be true, and states: ""But we think Glenn Beck definitely uses tactics like this to spread lies and misinformation."" In an interview with Ars Technica, he said the website was ""using Beck's tactics against him"". The website was created on September 1, and by September 3 attorneys for Beck's company Mercury Radio Arts took action. Beck's lawyers sent letters to the domain name registrar where they referred to the domain name itself as ""defamatory"", but they failed to get the site removed. 4=Marc Randazza, attorney for the website Beck filed a formal complaint with the Switzerland-based agency of the United Nations, the World Intellectual Property Organization. Beck alleged that the website's usage is libelous, bad faith, and could befuddle potential consumers. Beck's complaint was filed under the process called the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. The policy allows trademark owners to begin an administrative action by complaining that a certain domain registration is in ""bad faith"". A lawyer for Beck declined to provide a comment to the Boston Herald, however a source told the newspaper that Beck's complaint with the site is primarily a ""trademark issue"". Randazza established an attorney-client relationship with Eiland-Hall after his client received threatening letters from attorneys representing Beck. He then sent an email to Beck's attorneys, and pointed out inconsistencies between their client's recent actions and his prior public statements in support of the First Amendment. Randazza wrote a reply to the World Intellectual Property Organization, and contends that the website is ""protected political speech"", because it is ""satirical political humor"". Randazza stated that ""Even an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that it’s a parody."" In his legal brief, Randazza compared the website to other Internet memes, such as ""All your base are belong to us"" and video parodies of the German film Downfall. National Public Radio ""We are here because Mr. Beck wants Respondent's website shut down. He wants it shut down because Respondent's website makes a poignant and accurate satirical critique of Mr. Beck by parodying Beck's very rhetorical style,"" wrote Randazza in the brief. The brief also commented on Beck's style of reporting, and pointed out a controversial statement made by Beck when he interviewed a Muslim member of the United States Congress. Beck said to Representative Keith Ellison: ""I like Muslims, I've been to mosques. ... And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies."" According to the Citizen Media Law Project, the website's joke premise takes advantage of ""a perceived similarity between Beck's rhetorical style and the Gottfried routine"". Public interest attorney Paul Levy told Ars Technica that if a statement in a website's domain name were both false and ""stated with actual malice"", it is possible it could be considered defamatory. The First Post reported that Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Corynne McSherry gave an analysis asserting that though the domain name of the website is ""pretty dramatic"", it constituted ""pure political criticism and there's nothing wrong with that"". McSherry and Levy both agreed that the action of Beck to take the matter to the World Intellectual Property Organization was probably a tactic to determine the identity of the website's owner. Andy Carvin of National Public Radio wrote that Randazza's legal brief was amusing, commenting: ""It's not often that I would recommend reading a World Intellectual Property Organization legal brief for its entertainment value, but today is going to be an exception."" Nate Anderson of Ars Technica commented ""In any event, the WIPO battle promises to be entertaining, and there's even a bit of serious purpose mixed in with the frivolity. Just how far can WIPO go in using its domain dispute system to address Internet spats?"". Domain Name Wire wrote that ""...when someone who has created a bitingly satirical web site works with his lawyer to put pen to the paper, the end result can be quite amusing."" Writing for Adweek, Eriq Gardner pointed out the comparison made by Randazza's legal brief between the website's parody nature itself and the statement made by Beck to Congressman Ellison, noting: ""this case also makes a political point"". Jack Bremer wrote in The First Post that the attempts by Beck's lawyers to argue that the website's domain name is itself defamatory ""looks like a first in cyber law"". Rick Sawyer of Bostonist characterized Randazza's legal brief as ""Hillarious!"", and called the attorney ""among the North Shore's most hilarious legal writers"". Politics Daily The FOX News-critical site FoxNewsBoycott.com likened the legal conflict between Beck and the site to the Streisand effect, a phenomenon where an individual's attempt to censor material on the Internet in turn proves to make the material itself more public. ""Glenn Beck is experiencing the Streisand Effect first hand,"" wrote FoxNewsBoycott.com. John Cook of Gawker.com also compared Beck's actions to the Streisand effect: ""Now Glenn Beck's trying to shut down their web site, ensuring that people will write about it."" Jeffrey Weiss of Politics Daily wrote that by taking legal action, Beck ""did the one thing guaranteed to garner the greatest amount of publicity for the site"". Techdirt described Beck's legal action as ""not particularly smart"", and noted: ""Beck would have been better off just ignoring it. Instead, in legitimizing it by trying to take it down, many more people become aware of the meme -- and may start calling attention to situations where Beck (and others) make use of such tactics."" The blog Hot Air noted the issue could gain attention if it becomes a test case for the First Amendment: ""If this becomes a First Amendment test case, the smear’s going to be covered far and wide...""

tech,"SpaceThe TerreStar-1, an American communications satellite operated by TerreStar Corporation was launched Wednesday by an Ariane 5ECA rocket at 17:52 GMT by the European Space Agency (ESA) from the ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre. The 6,910-kilogram (15,200 lb) TerreStar-1 satellite cost US$300 million. It was launched from Kourou, French Guiana, a department of France in South America. This satellite weighs in as the heaviest and the largest telecommunications satellite ever launched. AT&amp;T Mobility along with TerreStar Corporation will market a hybrid prototype terrestrial/satellite hand set yet this year. The technology will allow the new hand set to operate on ground-based phone networks. In dead zones, the customer could use the device via satellite if they can access the southern sky similar to a satellite dish. The TerreStar-1 made a successful separation from the rocket according to Arianespace, the French satellite launcher. The satellite will be in orbit 22,000 miles (35,200 kilometers) above earth, and will open a 60 feet (18 meters) antenna dish to communicate with the hand sets over the 2 GHz (S-band) spectrum. The TerreStar-1 has a life expectancy of 15 years."
tech,"Sony's recently introduced Playstation Portable has proved popular with curious geeks who discovered various talents hidden within the new handheld video console. The biggest 'hack' so far has been the manipulation of a web browser embedded within the PSP game 'Wipeout Pure', which can be easily coaxed into accessing the majority of Internet via a suitable portal. Jonathan Terleski was able to monitor the digital conversation held between his PSP and Sony's website when the browser in his game 'Wipeout Pure' would try to download new software from Sony via the Internet. Using a suitably set up DNS server, Terleski configured his handheld console to access his own custom PSP portal, instead of Sony's website, and then invited other owners to use his gateway to the web. From this discovery, Robert Balousek later created a web based IRC interface that allows people to talk to each other and hold conversations in real time via the Internet on their PSP consoles. According to Reuters, his IRC website has to date been used by as many as 100,000 visitors and Balousek now plans to introduce a web based interface to the AOL instant messaging network for PSP users. Other notable recent 'hacks' include reading ebooks and comics and watching pre-recorded television shows, taken from a TiVo, on the Sony PSP. None of the 'hacks' have yet employed writing custom software for the device. So far, most are spin-offs of Jonathon Terleski's web browser hack. Other hacks, like the ebook reader and television show viewer, are made possible through use of the PSP's built in tools for viewing video and images. Sony has not yet released an SDK which would allow end-users to write 'homebrew' software, therefore hackers are tied to manipulating software included with the PSP or available through the games purchased separately. Speaking to Wikinews, Jacob Metcalf, who documented the web comic's hack on his website, explained his motivation: ""Web comics are already designed for on-screen reading and they have some of the same audience as people who play games - lots of the most popular web comics are about gamers, like PVP and Penny Arcade."" He added: ""I do wish that Sony would come out with an actual web browser like the Dreamcast had. South Korea is going to get a real web browser and I have a feeling in my gut that there is going to be Internet software for the PSP like a web browser and email announced at E3 this year."" * PSP Web portal * IRC online chat for PSP handhelds * Transfer television shows recorded in TiVo to a PSP * Reading eBooks on a PSP handheld * View downloaded comics on a PSP handheld"
tech,"A Kosmos-3M carrier rocket has successfully launched the SAR-Lupe 5 satellite, the fifth and final member of the German SAR-Lupe surveillance satellite system. The rocket lifted off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Northern Russia at 02:20 GMT this morning. The SAR-Lupe system uses Synthetic Aperture radar (SAR) to detect objects on the ground, even when it is too dark or cloudy for optical reconnaissance. The SAR-Lupe system consists of five satellites, which have been launched over the last two years. The first satellite was launched in mid-December 2006, and was followed by two more in 2007, in early July and November. The fourth satellite was launched in late March 2008. The system will be operated by the German military for at least ten years. Data will also be provided to the French military, in exchange for data from French reconnaissance satellites being provided to Germany. This is the 36th orbital launch of 2008, the third of which to have been conducted by a Kosmos-3M. Overall, this is the 444th launch of a Kosmos-3M rocket. The next Kosmos launch is expected to occur later this year, with a Parus navigation satellite, although it is currently unclear exactly when this launch will occur."

While no additional witnesses turned up, about two weeks later, 24-year-old George Gallo turned himself in. Police had thought that the extra attention brought to the case is what made Mr Gallo surrender; indeed, the video had been viewed 34,000 times. Additionally, the video had been seen from as far away as Singapore. Hamilton Police believes this is the first time YouTube has been used in an investigation, and they are considering using YouTube for future investigations. Detective Sergeant Jorge Lasso claims that he got the idea when he noted that the same people who attended the concert are the same people who are his children's ages. ""My own children are in that age category, and they spend all their time on the Internet; they do not watch mainstream media,"" he stated."

It is super high speed Internet that is capable of transmitting data with speeds of up to ten gigabits per second, 10,000 times faster than the current speed of broadband (1Mbps), and 200,000 times faster than dial-up. The New Zealand Government put NZ$43 million ($28.1 million USD) into the Crown company: Research and Education Advanced Network of New Zealand (REANNZ) organization, responsible for the running of KAREN. KAREN will link universities and research institutions in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hawkes Bay, Nelson and Rotorua and then to the rest of the world via a TelstraClear fibre optic cable. The network will allow geologists/geophysicists to access U.S. data on fault lines, 3D modellers the ability to collaborate on international mapping projects and students will be able to participate in interactive video lectures with experts, anywhere in the world. The technology so far is limited to just universities and research institutions but Minister for Education Steve Maharey said: ""The network will be extended over time to include other institutions, including schools, libraries and museums."" It is also limited to just one university in the South Island, it is located in the HIT Lab NZ at the University of Canterbury. Clark said: ""The link is crucial in order to attract and retain scientists, because it allows a greater level of real time collaboration between scientists based in New Zealand, and their colleagues around the world."" The Telecommunications' Users Association of New Zealand chief executive, Ernie Newman, said: ""Karen was a 'great initiative' for the science community, and that would have wider benefits for the country."" Dr. Mark Billinhurst, HIT Lab director, said: ""The network meant the country was now legitimately part of the international research community."""
tech,"ScientologyAdministrators for 711chan.org, one of the websites responsible for starting Project Chanology, a ""raid"" or attack against the Church of Scientology and their website, slowed down their ""attack"". In an exclusive interview with Wikinews, an administrator of 711chan states that they will ""probably stay away from the CoS Church of Scientology."" ""We're probably just going to stay away from the CoS raid. It was poorly managed. We could've brought down a lot more if we weren't just a bunch of unorganized brats,"" said 'Plasma', an administrator on 711chan.org. 4=Plasma, an administrator of 711chan. ""Many people from 711chan still want to raid, but the administration is sick of it,"" added Plasma who also stated that ""Partyvan IRC actually has decided to remove the raid."" Much of the reason stems from the fact that the attack on the Church was meant to stay within 711chan and that users were to stay ""anonymous."" An e-mail was leaked on the internet when the attack began exposing the script used to attack the Church's website. ""This is not what the raid originally started as. Partyvan declares this as a threat to the network, and Anonymous alike. We have been under constant botnet attacks, 711chan hacked, and tons of drama over this. You guys did a very poor job of staying Anonymous. It's obvious that a lot of you broke rules 1, and 2,"" said a statement on 711chan's website. The rules they refer to, according to Plasma, mean the ""Rules of the Internet"" and are: #Do not talk about /b/ (Only applies to raids.) #Do NOT talk about /b/ (eBaums did it.) Both key rules were broken by users, according to Plasma. The attack on Scientology was launched on Wednesday January 16 by a group labelled ""Anonymous"", on the website ""Insurgency Wiki"", a spinoff of 4chan which is also affiliated with 711chan. The ""History"" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube. Though YouTube complied with the Church of Scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as Gawker.com stated that they will keep hosting the video. One poster admitted to being a part of the effort, writing in a blog post ""I have myself, as per instructions, loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage. Theres sic something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these 'events' every now and again."" The poster wrote that ""Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video, a new obsession is taking hold on the internet. An insurgency against The Church of Scientology."" Not long after their attack, a previously unknown group called The Regime used keylogging to gain an administrator password to 711chan.org. ""I was actually away from home when I noticed my personal dedi was compromised (my bash_history file had lots of strange entries), so I informed Partyvan IRC staff (the CoS raid room as well as 711chan's IRC room are there) and minutes later, 711chan's machine was also compromised. I arrived home around an hour later, and immediately restored the contents of the 711 machine back to a previous state. I also got the passwords reset on my dedi and that was back in order. I went to bed shortly after that,"" said Plasma in regards to The Regime's attack on 711chan. ""The next morning I wake up to hundreds of MSN windows and emails telling me both servers have been compromised again, and our backups for 711 have been removed. The software we use to run 711chan's machine got bugged up somehow and make it difficult for me to fix things, which is why the site didn't respond at all for most of the day. At the time of writing this I still haven't got the backups reloaded onto the machine,"" added Plasma. Plasma states that 711chan.org will be off line at least until the end of January, possibly longer, but the site is not expected to change. ""I shut down our server to prevent any more damage. Right now, our plan is to lay low and get stuff started up on a more secure machine. We'll be back up by the end of the month, hopefully. 711chan will probably be staying the same it is, however,"" said Plasma. But they didn't go down without a fight adds Plasma. ""As who the ""Regime"" is? I took a look at one of the things they planted on my machine, which lead me to #!!regime on GameSurge IRC. `immortal' and about 30 drones were in that channel. Members of the g00ns community (allies of 711, also linked to Partyvan IRC) found out they had dox (documents such as phone numbers, addresses, SSN numbers, names, that sort of thing) on `immortal' and his wife. I actually have these details and attempted to call him, but it went unanswered,"" said Plasma. The information that 711chan.org obtained was later posted on the website operated by The Regime. Wikinews has attempted to contact The Regime a second time regarding the incident, and they have only replied with ""your articles are bullshit."""

tech,"Economy and business British-based utility company Centrica, which holds ownership of British Gas, has announced its intentions to increase the prices of domestic electricity and gas later this year. On August 18, 2011, the company plans to raise the costs of gas and electrical supplies by eighteen and sixteen per cent, respectively. According to The Guardian, nine million customers will be affected by these changes. British price comparison website uSwitch has reported that the ""average household bill for a dual fuel British Gas customer will now go up from £1,096 to £1,288"". Mike O'Connor, the chief executive officer of consumer organisation Consumer Focus, has claimed that the announcement ""will send a shock wave across the country"" and will place an increasing amount of difficulties ""on stretched household budgets. Consumers ... rightly question whether prices are fair."" Phil Bentley, a managing director for British Gas, has claimed that value increases like this are ""an issue facing all energy suppliers"". A director for British Gas, named Ian Peters, has claimed that ""a fair return"" will be made after the changes occur. In 2010, British Gas experienced its largest ever profit, making £742 million (US$1,192 million, €835 million). Meanwhile, Centrica achieved £2.4 billion (US$3.8 billion, €2.7 billion) in profits. Richard Lloyd from product sampling charity Which? criticised the decision to raise prices, calling the declaration ""unwelcome but unsurprising"" for British Gas consumers. Previously in December 2010, British Gas increased the price of its gas by 6.9%, which equates to £43 (US$69, €48). At the same time, the company's electricity prices were raised by 6.7%, or £28 (US$45, €32). On Friday, Chris Huhne, the secretary of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, said that British electricity businesses must modify themselves so as to avoid ""the cycle of fossil fuel addiction. Alternatives like renewables and nuclear power must be allowed to become the dominant component of our energy mix,"" said Huhne. This news comes to light as Scottish Power, a rival energy company to British Gas, announced last month their intentions to up the prices of their electricity and gas supplies by ten and nineteen per cent respectively."
tech,"The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has offered up a new definition of the word ""planet"" that could potentially increase our solar system's nine planets to at least twelve. According to the proposed definition, ""A planet is a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet."" Roughly speaking, the former includes objects over 5 x 1020 kilograms (1/12,000th of Earth's mass) and 800 kilometers in diameter, but all borderline cases would require confirmation by observation of their shape. According to this new definition, Ceres (an asteroid in the asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter), 2003UB313 (an astronomical object beyond Pluto which has previously been called the tenth planet), and Pluto's moon Charon may be dubbed planets. A dozen other candidates, like Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, 2003 EL61 etc., along with the asteroids Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea are awaiting evaluation by the IAU. The draft resolution also introduces the term ""pluton"", which refers to a growing subcategory of planets that have orbits around the sun that take at least 200 years to complete - effectively this will mean planets that orbit beyond Neptune. Plutons differ from classical planets: their orbit is highly tilted, eccentric and not circular, which suggests they have a different origin, the main reason why astronomers are interested in them. The word ""planet"" comes from the ancient Greek word for ""wanderer"", because it was known in ancient times that certain lights in the sky moved in relation to other stars. However, since then no formal definition of the word planet was agreed upon. With the advent of powerful telescopes on the ground and in space, knowledge about heavenly bodies became more complex, stressing the need for unambiguous definitions. The issue came to a head in 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object 2003UB313 (unofficially termed Xena by its discoverer, Michael E. Brown). 2003UB313 is a body larger than the smallest accepted planet, Pluto. The suggested definition is not universally popular: some astronomers would like to draw the line at Neptune, and wouldn't classify icy dwarfs like Pluto as a planet, but as a trans-Neptunian object (similar to the plutons in the draft resolution) part of the Kuiper belt. Robin Catchpole, from the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, said in an interview: ""The public are very clear about what they understand by ""planets"". Those are the big, dominant bodies in the Solar System that we're all familiar with, the eight - or nine if you include Pluto. I think including more is going to add confusion to the public, but not really be particularly useful for astronomers."" Pluto is now being considered to be moved off the list of classical planets, but as the prototype of the new plutons category. The ninth planet (as it is termed, but maybe not for long), discovered in 1930, is a curiosity among planets for more than one reason: because Charon is so big in comparison, both are considered twin planets by some. The current proposal is the result of two years work of the Planet Definition Committee of the IAU, which is responsible for the naming of astronomical objects. The 26th IAU General Assembly in Prague plans to vote on the proposal on Thursday, August 24 of 2006. When asked if he was confident the proposal would get the necessary two thirds of the votes, Professor Owen Gingerich, Chair of the IAU Planet Definition Committee, replied: ""I'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution, but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement."""

tech,"White 'chunks' that were photographed by the Phoenix lander on Mars on June 15 after digging a trench, have disappeared, leading scientists to believe they most certainly found ice on the Red Planet. ""It must be ice. These little clumps completely disappearing over the course of a few days, that is perfect evidence that it's ice. There had been some question whether the bright material was salt. Salt can't do that,"" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona located in Tucson, Arizona. The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called ""Dodo-Goldilocks"" when Phoenix's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15, during the 20th Martian day, or sol, since landing. Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench early today, on Sol 24. Digging in a different trench Phoenix's robotic Arm connected with a hard surface that has scientists excited about the prospect of next uncovering an icy layer. ""We have dug a trench and uncovered a hard layer at the same depth as the ice layer in our other trench,"" said Washington University robotic arm investigator for Phoenix, Ray Arvidson. The arm tried at least three times to penetrate the layer, but was unsuccessful. As a result the arm went into a holding pattern, awaiting its next commands."

tech,"A major security hole was discovered in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) of the Debian version of OpenSSL. OpenSSL is one of the most used cryptographic software, that allows the creation of secure network connections with the protocols called SSL and TLS. It is included in many popular computer programs, like the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Apache web server. Debian is one of the most used GNU/Linux distributions, on which are based other distributions, like Ubuntu and Knoppix. The problem affects all the Debian-based distributions that were used to create cryptographic keys since the September 17, 2006. The bug was discovered by Luciano Bello, an argentine Debian package maintainer, and was announced on May 13, 2008. This vulnerability was caused by the removal of two lines of code from the original version of the OpenSSL library. These lines were used to gather some entropy data by the library, needed to seed the PRNG used to create private keys, on which the secure connections are based. Without this entropy, the only dynamic data used was the PID of the software. Under Linux the PID can be a number between 1 and 32,768, that is a too small range of values if used to seed the PRNG and will cause the generation of predictable numbers. Therefore any key generated can be predictable, with only 32,767 possible keys for a given architecture and key length, and the secrecy of the network connections created with those keys is fully compromised. These lines were removed as ""suggested"" by two audit tools (Valgrind and Purify) used to find vulnerabilities in the software distributed by Debian. These tools warned the Debian maintainers that some data was used before its initialization, that normally can lead to a security bug, but this time it was not the case, as the OpenSSL developers wrote on March 13, 2003. Anyway this change was erroneously applied on September 17, 2006, when the OpenSSL Debian version 0.9.8c-1 was released to the public. Even though the Debian maintainer responsible for this software released a patch to fix this bug on May 8, 2008, the impact may be severe. In fact OpenSSL is commonly used in software to protect the passwords, to offer privacy and security. Any private key created with this version of OpenSSL is weak and must be replaced, included the session keys that are created and used only temporary. This means that any data encrypted with these keys can be decrypted without a big deal, even if these keys are used (but not created) with a version of the library not affected, like the ones included in other operating systems. For example any web server running under any operating system may use a weak key created on a vulnerable Debian-based system. Any encrypted connection (HTTPS) to this web server established by any browser can be decrypted. This may be a serious problem for sites that requires a secure connection, like banks or private web sites. Also, if some encrypted connection was recorded in the past, it can be decrypted in the same way. Another serious problem is for the network security software, like OpenSSH and OpenVPN, that are used to encrypt the traffic to protect passwords and grant the access to an administrative console or a private network protected by firewalls. This may allows hackers to gain unwanted access to private computers, networks or data traveled over the network, even if a not affected version of OpenSSL was used. The same behavior can be applied to any software or protocol that use SSL, like POP3S, SSMTP, FTPS, if used with a weak key. This is the case of Tor, software used to offer strong anonymity on the TCP/IP, where about 300 of 1,500-2,000 nodes used a weak key. With 15-20% of weak Tor nodes, there is a probability of 0.34-0.8% circa to build a circuit that has all tree nodes weak, resulting in a full loss of anonymity. Also the case of only one weak node begin used may facilitate some types of attack to the anonymity. The Tor hidden services, a sort of anonymous public servers, are affected too. However the issue was speedily addressed on May 14, 2008. The same problem also interested anonymous remailers like Mixmaster and Mixminion, that use OpenSSL to create the remailer keys for the servers and the nym keys for the clients. Although currently there is no official announcement, at least two remailer changed their keys because were weak."
tech,"InfosectionEnd The Space Shuttle Atlantis has received at least a 4 inch tear on its Thermal Protection System (TPS) on one of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods near the thrusters after it took off on June 8, but officials say the damage is not concerning yet, and the OMS was not damaged. ""There's not a whole lot of concerns just yet,"" said a spokesman for NASA, Louis Parker. ""Preliminary Area of Interest in TPS inspection: Around a 4 inch blanket reported sticking out at the port OMS pod. Crew reported that on the port OMS pod they can see a 4 to 5 inch piece of blanket sticking up. They are getting photos,"" said NASA. The OMS is used to control the shuttle's movement in space and is also used for orbital injection and NASA says that preliminary imaging shows that the OMS was not damaged. ""Analysis by launch team looking at other camera views show that the tyvek cover did not strike the OMS pod,"" said NASA. Astronauts inspected the shuttle for more damage at approximately 2:00 p.m. (eastern time) using Atlantis's robotic arm with digital cameras placed on the end, but found none and Atlantis is still planned to dock with the International Space Station."
tech,"The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft has discovered ice deposits in the south pole of Mars that are larger than the state of Texas. Scientists say that there is enough water in the deposits to cover the entire planet with up to 36 feet of water if the ice was to melt. Some sections of the ice deposits are up to 2.3 - 2.5 miles deep. The ice is composed of carbon dioxide, a little bit of dust, and water (90 percent of the water is estimated to be frozen). What has caught the attention of the scientists working on the Mars Express project is that this may help reveal whether or not there is any (microbial) life within the ice. Another perplexing question that scientists are trying to solve is what happened to all the water that produced all the channels on the surface of Mars. Jeffrey Plaut, who is from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and who is also leading the study, noted that, ""We have this continuing question facing us in studies of Mars, which is: where did all the water go? Even if you took the water in these two (polar) ice caps and added it all up, it's still not nearly enough to do all of the work that we've seen that the water has done across the surface of Mars in its history."" Currently, only 10 percent of the water is remaining and is located at the poles of Mars. It has been suggested that some of the remaining 90 percent of the water that disappeared could either be underground or could have simply left the atmosphere into space."
tech,"A Russian Kosmos-3M rocket has launched the German SAR-Lupe 4 reconnaissance satellite into low Earth orbit. Lift-off, from area 132/1 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Northern Russia, occurred at 17:15 GMT. The launch, which was originally scheduled to occur today, was moved up to Tuesday, and subsequently delayed twice due to strong winds at an altitude of 13 kilometres, which prevented launch. SAR-Lupe is a German reconnaissance satellite constellation, consisting of five spacecraft. The first of these was launched in December 2006. The next satellite, SAR-Lupe 5, is scheduled for launch sometime around October 2008. The spacecraft are equipped with Synthetic Apperture Radar (SAR), which allows them to produce imagery at night, and through cloud cover. The carrier rocket which was used, Kosmos-3M, is a derivative of the Soviet R-14 missile. It first flew in 1967, and the launch of SAR-Lupe 4 marks its 442nd flight. It is also the 900th launch of a member of the R-14 family of rockets. The launch was declared successful, with the satellite reaching orbit at 17:43 GMT. It is the fourteenth orbital launch of 2008."
tech,"Space On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin lifted off on Vostok 1, the first human spaceflight in history, completing one orbit of the Earth in just under two hours. Tuesday marks the anniversary of Gagarin's flight and fifty years of human space travel. Celebrations were to take place all over the world and aboard the International Space Station. Yuri's Night, started in 2001 for fortieth anniversary celebrations, is a global celebration of the history of spaceflight, including the first Space Shuttle launch on April 12, 1981, the twentieth anniversary of Gagarin's flight. There were to be more than 400 events in 71 countries celebrating Yuri's Night this year. Gagarin's flight lasted 108 minutes, just under two hours, and consisted of one full orbit around the Earth. His trip to orbit came just four years after the launch of Sputnik 1 and the beginning of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR). The crew on board the International Space Station (ISS) also marked the fiftieth anniversary by delivering a message from space. While addressing viewers, station commander Dmitry Kondratyev referred to the portrait of Gagarin floating next to him as a representation of the achievement of ""humankind at large"". A movie, entitled First Orbit, was filmed in parts in space when the orbit of the ISS matched that of Gagarin's flight. The movie, produced by filmmaker Christopher Riley, was filmed by ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli and matches the radio communications, times, and views of the flight. The film is freely available to the public and made its debut on Tuesday to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the human race becoming a space-faring species."
tech,"Microsoft Windows metafiles have been discovered to be a vector for computer viruses, as they are treated as image files, but can execute machine code. Windows metafiles often use the extension .wmf files, but they may also execute if their extension is .jpeg, .png or any other common image extension. This vulnerability affects any Windows software which displays images, including instant messenger software, email clients, and web browsers. Firefox reduces the vulnerability by asking a user before executing Windows metafiles, but metafiles masquerading as another format will still be executed automatically by the operating system. Microsoft has not yet issued a patch for the vulnerability, prompting Ilfak Guilfanov to release an unofficial patch. Microsoft's security advisory recommends unregistering shimgvw.dll to disable handling of Windows MetaFiles. Critics point out that shimgvw.dll could become re-registered by malicious processes or other installations. They also suggest that malicious Windows Metafiles could merely remain ""dormant"" until shimgvw.dll is re-registered. The exploit has been used to attack online forums which allow embedding of image files via &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags, prompting some gaming forums to disable &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags . Any site accepting image media upload, such as avatars, will also be vulnerable if this site accepts .wmf files, possibly masquerading as another media file format. The exploit has also been used by an instant messaging worm, which appears to provide a backdoor for later exploitation via an IRC bot . The McAfee antivirus company said the WMF vulnerability is being exploited to drop over 30 variants of the Bifrose backdoor trojan horse, and exploitation by other malware is likely. McAfee estimates the first generation of such exploits had infected more than 6% of their customer base by 31 December 2005.

""NASA's senior managers have signed the Certification of Flight Readiness confirming that Space Shuttle Atlantis, her flight crew and payloads are fit to fly,"" said a statement posted on NASA's website. Atlantis's main engines, orbital maneuvering system and forward reaction control system was pressurized this past weekend and the crew's equipment has been put into stowage. NASA plans to launch Atlantis despite a vote reached by the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, IAMAW, a union that is representing 570 workers that work with the shuttle program, but according to a union spokeswoman, the strike is not going to affect the launching of Atlantis. ""The bottom line is, a strike would not affect the next launch or the next one after that,"" said IAMAW spokeswoman, Tracy Yates. The union voted down a contract because the workers believed that NASA's wage offer is ""substandard."" Atlantis will deliver equipment to the International Space Station and to make repairs to it. Commanding Atlantis for its mission will be Rick Sturckow and Lee Archambault will serve as Atlantis' pilot. Mission Specialists James Reilly, Steven Swanson, John Olivas and Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson round out the crew to deliver the S3/S4 starboard truss segments, batteries and another pair of solar arrays to the space station."

tech,"NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has discovered more evidence on the Planet Mars that water may have flowed beneath the surface and that ""cracks"" that lead below the surface may have, at one time, been ""habitable"" for ""microbial life,"" according to the head investigater for the orbiter's camera, Dr. Alfred McEwen. The location of the find is near the Candor Chasma canyon and images of the cracks were taken in September of 2006. ""This result shows how orbital observations can identify features of particular interest for future exploration on the surface or in the subsurface or by sample return. The alteration along fractures, concentrated by the underground fluids, marks locations where we can expect to find key information about chemical and perhaps biologic processes in a subsurface environment that may have been habitable,"" said McEwen. According to NASA scientists, ""mineralization"" was found on the surface of the cracks and the crack's fractures. Scientists say the minerals became visible after layers of sand and dirt eroded away from the cracks. The minerals were likely placed on the rocks after dissolving in water and then evaporating onto the rocks, causing the minerals to become rock. Another possibility on how the minerals were placed there is that the ""fluid"" circulating on the rock was a gas, which might or might not have contained water. ""What caught my eye was the bleaching or lack of dark material along the fracture. That is a sign of mineral alteration by fluids that moved through those joints. It reminded me of something I had seen during field studies in Utah, that is light-tone zones, or 'haloes,' on either side of cracks through darker sandstone,"" said University of Arizona, Tucson geologist, Dr. Chris Okubo. ""The haloes visible along fractures seen in the Candor Chasma image appear to be slightly raised relative to surrounding, darker rock. This is evidence that the circulating fluids hardened the lining of the fractures, as well as bleaching it. The harder material would not erode away as quickly as softer material farther from the fractures,"" said a statement on NASA's website. It is not clear how long the minerals might have been present or how long it took them to get on the rocks. ""It is hard to say how long ago the fluids were there - hundreds of millions or perhaps a billion years ago. But the fact that we see evidence for chemical reactions between the fluids and the rock means that the fluids were sitting there for quite a long time ... that's perhaps good if you want to look for any habitable areas that might support any biological activity,"" added Okubo. ""This publication is just the first of many, many to come. The analysis is based on test observations taken even before the start of our main science phase. Since then, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned several terabits of science data, sustaining a pace greater than any other deep space mission. This flood of data will require years of study to exploit their full value, forever increasing our understanding of Mars and its history of climate change,"" added Okubo."
tech,"Transport Solar Impulse, the world’s most advanced solar powered plane has just completed the first of the five legs of its trans-continental journey, flying fuel-free from San Francisco to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, in just over 18 hours. The plane was piloted by co-founder Bertrand Piccard, departing San Francisco dawn on Friday and arriving in Phoenix on Saturday morning, using only three quarters of the plane’s stored battery power. ""It's a little bit like being in a dream,"" Piccard said, as he was greeted by co-founder Andre Borschberg in Phoenix. Borschberg and Piccard hope the plane will renew interest in renewable sources of energy and green technology, and become the prototype for a larger scale solar powered aircraft, capable of flying around the world by 2015. ""If an airplane can fly day or night with no fuel, just on the sun's power, of course it means that everybody in daily life can use this technology for his house, for heating and cooling systems, for lighting, for cars, for trucks. There's so much we can do now to have a cleaner future,"" Piccard said. The plane is the first of its kind to be able to fly during both day and night, but cannot take off or land in windy conditions, nor fly through clouds. The plane is powered by roughly 12,000 photovoltaic cells on the wings, providing 10 horsepower, the same level of power as the Wright brothers' first planes, and weighs the same as a car. ""One hundred years ago, the planes had to fly in good weather and there was only one person on board,"" Piccard said. ""Now we have completely new technology, we fly with no fuel at all. But, of course, we need to fly in good weather and we carry only one pilot on board. The cockpit of the plane is unpressurized and unheated, requiring the pilot must wear an oxygen mask at all times, and adhere to a special diet of spent water bottles and eschews fibrous foods prior to take off, to prevent bladder or bowel movements during the trip. Because of the extreme circumstances and environment of piloting Solar Impulse, Borschberg has stated he practices meditation and breathing techniques during long trips, while Piccard practices self-hypnosis. Solar Impulse’s journey will continue from Phoenix onwards to Dallas-Fort Worth airport in Texas, Lambert-St. Louis airport, Dulles airport in the Washington area and New York's John F. Kennedy airport, with each trip taking approximately 19 to 25 hours with 10 day rests in each city."

The EFF claims that AT&amp;T turned over 2 databases consisting of their subscribers' communication and internet usage records. Attorney Kevin Bankston representing the EFF said the government could not conduct their surveillance without the help of companies like AT&amp;T. He also said their goal is to tell AT&amp;T that it is not in their fiscal best interests, along with not being legal, to cooperate with the President's wiretap program. According to the class action suit, AT&amp;T granted ""access to all or a substantial number of the communications transmitted through its key domestic telecommunications facilities, including direct access to streams of domestic, international and foreign telephone and Internet communications."" The lawsuit is seeking damages of $22,000 for each AT&amp;T customer in addition to punitive fines. AT&amp;T is also facing scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission and possibly fines for failing to properly certify that customer records were safeguarded."

tech,"A SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket has failed during its third attempt to reach orbit. Over four years behind schedule, the rocket lifted off from Omelek Island, part of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, at 03:34 GMT this morning, carrying three technology development satellites, and the ashes of 208 people, including astronaut Gordon Cooper, and Star Trek actor James Doohan. According to a statement issued by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the first and second stages of the rocket failed to separate, making this the third consecutive unsuccessful launch for the Falcon 1, which is yet to conduct a successful mission. Musk described the failure as a ""big disappointment"". The primary payload for this flight was the Trailblazer satellite, which was to have been operated by the United States Air Force, and MDA. Two CubeSats, Pharmasat Risk Evaluation Satellite (PREsat) and Nanosail-D, were also to have been deployed. The CubeSats would have been operated by NASA and Santa Clara University. The space burial capsules, named Explorers and operated by Celestis, were to have intentionally remained bolted to the second stage of the rocket. The remains of several famous individuals were flown, most notably Project Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper and actor James Doohan, best known for his role as Montgomery Scott in the science fiction television series Star Trek. Director John Meredyth Lucas, who also worked on Star Trek, had some of his ashes on the flight as well, as did Mareta West an astrogeologist who was responsible for choosing the landing sites for the Apollo missions to the Moon. This is the second consecutive failure of a major orbital space burial mission, following a failed Taurus launch in September 2001. The last successful major orbital space burial was conducted in December 1999, although a single burial capsule was launched aboard the New Horizons spacecraft in 2006. This launch was originally planned to occur in early 2004, with the TacSat-1 satellite and the Explorers payload. It would have been the maiden flight of the Falcon 1. A number of procurement delays pushed it to 2005, and subsequent issues with the availability of Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg AFB, from where it was originally scheduled to launch, led to the first attempts to launch being made in late 2005. During the second attempted countdown, a faulty valve caused the first stage fuel tank to be deformed, leading to a delay. In March 2006, a flight which was originally scheduled to be conducted after this one, with the FalconSat-2 spacecraft, was launched as the maiden flight, and ended in failure less than a minute after lift-off due to a fuel leak. This caused delays for all other Falcon launches, and a test flight without a functional payload was added to the schedule in order to ensure that the problems with the rocket had been resolved. This was launched in March 2007, and also failed - this time due to a sequence of events started by human error in setting the fuel ratio for the first stage. Despite the failure to reach orbit, most critical systems were tested, so the third flight was cleared to launch an operational payload. In the meantime, the satellite that was to replace TacSat-1, TacSat-2, was launched, and TacSat-1 was subsequently cancelled as obsolete. During early 2008, the US Air Force announced that they would replace it with a satellite for a programme called Jumpstart, which would be selected a few weeks before launch. Trailblazer was chosen in late May, over two other options, PnPSat, or a pair of CubeSats. The launch was at that time scheduled for late June, but it was subsequently delayed due to small cracks in one of the rocket's engines. Today's launch followed an eventful countdown, lasting almost to the end of the five hour launch window, with the loading of helium onto the rocket taking longer than expected, and requiring several long holds. Following this, an attempt to launch was made at 03:00 GMT, which resulted in a last-second abort at T-0, just after ignition of the main engine, due to a marginal performance issue with the turbopump. The launch was recycled, and the rocket lifted off 34 minutes later. This was the first flight of an uprated version of the Merlin engine, which powers the first stage. The new version, named Merlin-1C, features regenerative cooling as opposed to ablative cooling used on the earlier launches. It is believed that the failure of the launch was unrelated to the presence of the new engine, the performance of which was described as ""picture-perfect"" by Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX. The next Falcon 1 launch was scheduled to have been launched in September with the Razaksat spacecraft for ATSB of Malaysia, and up to three CubeSats. This will almost certainly be delayed whilst the failure is investigated. It is unclear whether this failure will affect the maiden flight of the larger Falcon 9, currently scheduled for 2009, on a demonstration mission for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services programme. Today's launch is the 38th orbital launch of 2008, and following the resale and recovery of the AMC-14 satellite, the first outright failure of the year."

The Mars-500 team consist of a Chinese man, a Frenchman, an Italian, and three Russians. Only the Chinese man, Wang Yue, is a trained astronaut. The six waved goodbye, crying ""see you in 520 days' time!"". According to Wang, not being able to see their families and friends was one of the greatest challenges, although e-mail is allowed during the experiment. Both Wang and the Frenchman, Romain Charles, expressed pride to be part of this experiment. Wang said, ""it will be trying for all of us. We cannot see our family, we cannot see our friends, but I think it is all a glorious time in our lives."" The joint-effort project is being organised by the Russian Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency; the goal is to study physical and psychological effects on would-be astronauts. All six men speak reasonable English; however, as Russian is another primary language for the simulated trip, Russian crew member Sukhrob Kamolov said body language will be used should they fail to understand one another. Food for the volunteers will be rationed as it would in a real Mars mission. All supplies were supplied by China and loaded into the 'simulated spacecraft' prior to the beginning of the experiment. For backup, China is sending three mission support staff to Russia. No women are included in the crew, excluding issues relating to a mixed-sex crew from the study. During a similar experiment in 1999, a woman complained that the captain attempted to kiss her. Following 250 days of ""travelling"" to Mars, the group will split. Three will stay in the ""spacecraft"", the other three going to the surface of ""Mars"". Only two will actually leave the ""spacecraft"" to study the surface of ""Mars"". After a month, the group will go through the return journey simulation, a 240 day trip. The men will follow a strict timetable, with 8 hours each of sleep, work, and leisure each day."
tech,"__NOTOC__ Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) successfully launched and sent into orbit a Falcon 1 rocket, which was launched yesterday at 23:15 UTC from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. This was the fourth attempt to launch this class of rocket, and the first vehicle to be successfully launched by private spacecraft developers. Previous attempts to launch this vehicle ended in failure due to engineering errors. Perhaps the most critical part of this flight occurred during the stage separation between the first and second stages of this rocket. In this flight, unlike previous attempts, the separation was without incident and the second stage maintained the planned trajectory into orbit. The rocket achieved an orbit at an altitude of 135 miles above the Earth after approximately ten minutes of powered flight. The main technical difference between the third and fourth attempts was an adjustment in the timing between shutting down the first stage rocket engine and when the stage separation takes place. On the third attempt, the first and second stages collided into each other immediately after stage separation, which in turn damaged the second stage engine and resulted in a mission failure. For this fourth attempt, the stage separation occurred without any problem, and was greeted with loud cheers and applause by SpaceX employees who were watching a live telecast of the launch at the Hawthorne, California, USA manufacturing plant. This telecast was also released as a live video feed on the SpaceX website during the launch. While other rocket companies have been successful at sending vehicles into orbit before, this is the first vehicle that has been designed from scratch without any components that came from previous government-sponsored vehicles. This is also the first privately developed liquid-fueled vehicle that has achieved orbit. Elon Musk, founder, primary investor, and CEO of SpaceX, congratulated his employees upon reaching this milestone, saying ""That was frickin' awesome! There's only a handful of countries on Earth that have done this. It's usually a country thing, not a company thing. We did it."" He also said later on, ""Definitely one of the best days of my life."" The payload of this rocket consisted of a 360 pound engineering test object made of aluminum, which was also fabricated by SpaceX in their Hawthorne manufacturing facility. Called the Ratsat, it was decorated with a logo of a rat by the SpaceX team that built it. Elon Musk estimates that it will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere. Additional milestones accomplished by SpaceX on this flight included a successful deployment of parachutes on the first stage of this rocket, where SpaceX hopes to be able to recover this stage and be able to re-use that portion of the rocket on a future flight with some refurbishing. The second stage also performed an additional test by restarting its engine and moving to a higher orbit at between 300 to 450 miles (500 to 700 km) above the Earth with an inclination of 9.2 degrees, passing above the International Space Station during the maneuver. ""This is a great day for SpaceX and the culmination of an enormous amount of work by a great team,"" said Elon Musk, ""The data shows we achieved a super precise orbit insertion—middle of the bull's-eye — and then went on to coast and restart the second stage, which was icing on the cake."" SpaceX is offering future flights of the Falcon 1 to the public for a price of about $7.9 million USD each, although Mr. Musk estimated that the total cost to test and develop this rocket, including the three previous failed launch attempts, came to about $100 million USD. The next launch of the Falcon 1 is slated to happen sometime toward the end of the year, with a satellite that was manufactured and paid by the Malaysian government. Also scheduled for early next year is the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 rocket, which uses a multiples of nine rocket engines that are identical to the engine that was used in today's launch as well as many of the other components that were used on the Falcon 1. SpaceX is also under contract with NASA to develop a vehicle called the Dragon that will be supplying cargo to the International Space Station under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. This spacecraft is also intended to eventually be capable of manned spaceflight."

tech,"North KoreaNorth Korea may be planning to launch one of its Taepodong-2 missiles in the next few days, having announced earlier that it intends to put a communications satellite into space. U.S. intelligence officials announced Wednesday that a missile had been rolled out to a pad at its Musudan launch facility. It is unknown whether the missile is in fact carrying a satellite, or if a warhead may be in its place. The missile is reported to be capable of carrying either. Only after a post-launch analysis will officials be able to determine what the missile may have been carrying. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented that were North Korea to launch a missile, they would be in violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution, and that the U.S. would voice its opposition with the U.N. if North Korea went through with the plan. Fears abound over the possibility of the missile being used in warfare, with the Taepodong-2 rumored to be able to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii. Japan has warned that it will shoot down any such missiles launched by North Korea with its U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile defense system. South Korea's response was less specific, with chief nuclear envoy Wi Sung-lac saying ""If North Korea launches a rocket, certain countermeasures are unavoidable."" The previous launch of a Taepodong-2 missile was in 2006, which ended in failure after it went out of control and was destroyed."
tech,"RFID chips, the major component of e-passports, emit radio signals that can be read at a short distance by an electronic reader. Lukas Grunwald and Christian Bottger realised that they could clone an identical and undetectable e-passport. They downloaded the data from their own passport using an RFID reader (available from eBay) and then onto a blank chip thanks to a software they have developed, called RFdump. Doing so, they were able to clone an e-passport in less than five minutes. Ironically, a spokesman from the UK Home Office said: It is hard to see why anyone would want to access the information on the chip. A European Union funded network of IT security experts has come out against the e-passport scheme. The experts said that it is not too late to roll back and rethink the ePassport. Wikinews previously reported that Turkey, where there seems to be no discussion about the controversies surrounding RFID chips, is switching to e-passports towards the middle of next year."
tech,"""Buy cheap Viagra through us - no prescription required!"" Anyone with an active email account will recognize lines like this one. According to some reports, unsolicited advertisements (spam) for Viagra and similar drugs account for one in four spam messages. BACKGROUND Spamming remains one of the biggest problems facing email users today. While users and systems administrators have improved their defenses against unsolicited email, many spammers now insert random words or characters into their letters in order to bypass filters. The Wikipedia article Stopping email abuse provides an overview of the various strategies employed by companies, Internet users and systems administrators to deal with the issue. Ever since pharmaceutical giant Pfizer promised to cure erectile dysfunction once and for all with its blue pills containing the drug sildenafil citrate, spammers have tried to tap into male anxiety by offering prescription-free sales of unapproved ""generic"" Viagra and clones such as Cialis soft tabs. Legislation like the U.S. CAN-SPAM act has done little to stem the tide of email advertising the products. Now Pfizer has entered a pledge with Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, to address the problem. The joint effort will focus on lawsuits against spammers as well as the companies they advertise. ""Pfizer is joining with Microsoft on these actions as part of our shared pledge to reduce the sale of these products and to fight the senders of unsolicited e-mail that overwhelms people's inboxes,"" said Jeff Kindler, executive vice president at Pfizer. Microsoft has filed civil actions against spammers advertising the websites CanadianPharmacy and E-Pharmacy Direct. Pfizer has filed lawsuits against the two companies, and has taken actions against websites which use the word ""Viagra"" in their domain names. Sales of controlled drugs from Canadian pharmacies to the United States are illegal, but most drugs sold in Canada have nevertheless undergone testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is not the case for many of the Viagra clones sold by Internet companies and manufactured in countries like China and India. While it was not clear that CanadianPharmacy was actually shipping drugs from Canada, Pfizer's general counsel, Beth Levine, claimed that the company filled orders using a call center in Montreal, reported the Toronto Star. For Microsoft's part, they allege that the joint effort with Pfizer is part of their ""multi-pronged attack on the barrage of spam."" As the creator of the popular email program Outlook, Microsoft has been criticized in the past for the product's spam filtering process. Recently, Microsoft added anti-spam measures to its popular Exchange server. Exchange 2003 now includes support for accessing so-called real-time block lists, or RTBLs. An RTBL is a list of the IP addresses maintained by a third party; the addresses on the list are those of mailservers thought to have sent spam recently. Exchange 2003 can query the list for each message it receives."
tech,"The revolutionary space telescope that brought great images of space back down to Earth will lose out in NASA's budget reorganisation for 2006. While NASA's budget will increase by 2.6%, most of Hubble's $93 million in funding will be directed into bringing it safely to Earth. The big winners include the space shuttle program and the International Space Station, including the development of a new Shuttle replacement. A planned fifth maintenance job on the space telescope was cancelled as a result of the Columbia disaster, and experts argue as to how long it can remain useful to scientists. It is expected to fail irreversibly by 2007 if vital work is not done. Another project to bite the dust was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO), which would have been the largest satellite ever sent to the outer solar system. It was to have featured a new form of nuclear reactor as propulsion, but instead NASA has allocated $320 million to developing nuclear technologies in space in a less aggressive, more stepped approach. In a January 2004 speech, George W. Bush proposed a human return to the Moon and a first journey to Mars. This grand aim is behind the agency's new budget, with $6.8 billion (over one-third of the total) devoted to the ISS, Space Shuttle and space travel support."

The device features the Android operating system and a seven-inch screen. Samsung's own applications, called ""Reader's Hub"" and ""Media Hub,"" display ebooks and videos respectively. Latest Flash, and an interface to stream to TV also are included. Wireless technologies supported include 3G networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The device is a competitor to Apple's iPad. British newspaper The Daily Mail considered the appearance of the Galaxy Tab on the market as a serious event for Apple, because the device has a smaller screen, and Samsung was expecting to set a price 1.5 to 2 times lower than the iPad. Samsung were considering a ten inch screen on future models. Galaxy Tab is ""the first of the company's tablet devices"", as a spokesperson said. Head of product portfolio Thomas Richter expressed optimism about the device's market future : ""This is not just another tablet. We call it a Smart Media device."" Samsung's head of mobile communications J.K. Shin was also positive about the release of Galaxy Tab, commenting that ""there is a new and emerging consumer demand that Samsung can satisfy since mobile is in our DNA."""
tech,"Forecasters predict that northern lights could be visible to the naked eye late tonight and early tomorrow morning across Canada, northern parts of the U.S., and possibly the United Kingdom. Solar storms caused a large ejection of plasma from the Sun's surface on Sunday, and the plasma is heading directly towards Earth. The plasma, a cloud of rapidly moving hydrogen gas atoms and subatomic particles, is expected to reach us late Tuesday. The plasma will interact with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, which will cause northern lights, or aurora borealis, to be visible much further south than is usual. Northern lights usually appear as green or red rivers of lights across the sky. ""It's the first major Earth-directed eruption in quite some time"" said astronomer Leon Golub of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The eruption was detected by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which was launched in February 2010, and is currently orbiting the Earth. The Sun goes through approximately eleven-year long activity cycles, with the last maximum occurring in 2001. Sunday's eruption is a sign that the many years of inactivity is over, and the Sun is heading towards another maximum."

Google is reported to have removed the website due to the use of a trick to raise its website ratings in the search engine's results. The online version of Forbes magazine reported that the German word for used car, Gebrauchtwagen, appeared 42 times in a doorway web page created by the German car manufacturer. Doorway web pages contain many keywords designed to attract search robots. The page presented to Google's robot for indexing was significantly different from the page presented to the site's visitors. According to a recent blog post by Matt Cutts, one of Google's software engineers, this technique is ""a violation of our webmaster quality guidelines.""

BMW reacted to the measure by claiming that it had no intention of manipulating the search results, but instead used the doorway pages with the objective of ""offering a better service"" to those looking for used cars."
tech,"Russian astrologist Marina Bai has filed suit in Moscow asking for 8.7 billion rubles (311 million U.S. dollars) because, she claims, the NASA Deep Impact mission damaged her business by altering her ability to provide accurate horoscopes, harmed her ""system of spiritual values,"" and will ""interfere with the natural life of the universe."" ""It is obvious that elements of the comet's orbit, and correspondingly the ephemeris, will change after the explosion, which interferes with my astrology work and distorts my horoscope,"" Bai was quoted in the daily newspaper, Izvestia. NASA has refuted similar accusations by pointing out that this impact is only a new addition to many previous collisions already on the comet. On July 4, NASA successfully crashed a probe into the Tempel 1 comet in hopes the debris kicked up in the resulting explosion could shed light in the building blocks of the early solar system. The lawsuit, originally filed in June, has not yet been scheduled for an initial hearing, according to Russian authorities."
tech,"Scientists confirmed today for the first time ever, that astronomers photographed a planet orbiting a sun other than our own. Photographs were taken late last year by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile, but it has taken since then to confirm that the body is indeed a planet &amp;mdash; five times the size of Jupiter, the largest planet that orbits our own sun. Extra-solar planets such as this have been detected before, but never by direct observation &amp;mdash; their presence has always been inferred from aberrant behaviour of the star they circulate around. ""Among the most essential quests of modern astronomers, taking direct images of planets outside of our solar system is certainly up there among chart-toppers,"" says the ESO, in a press release given to verify the status of the object. The newly imaged planet orbits a brown dwarf star known to scientists as 2M1207, at a distance that is nearly twice as far as that of Neptune from our own sun &amp;mdash; making the planet much too cold for lifeforms such as those on Earth. Detection of Earth-like planets is still years away, according to the ESO, because they are too faint for current equipment to detect. The scientists say that the planet presents a valuable opportunity nonetheless, as it is much younger than those in our own system, at only ""a few tens of millions of years old"". ""Moreover, as the first tens of millions of years are considered to have been a critical period in the formation of Earth and of our own solar system, the study of nearby young planetary systems provides astronomers with invaluable insight on our own origins."" Suns are understood to form when matter collapses strongly under its own gravity, while planets form later by accretion, in matter orbiting a sun. Photographs of what was thought to be an extra-solar planet were announced earlier this month. However scientists now state that the size of that planet might be much larger than originally announced, thus allowing a chance that the object might instead be a small star."

This is 115th Space Shuttle Flight and the second since the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003. The ascent was described as ""smooth"", however NASA engineers will be looking for traces of damage to the shuttle's heat shield that may be caused by foam falling from the external tank. Launch occurred on schedule at 2:38 p.m. EDT (18:38 UTC), with the spacecraft reaching orbit 8 minutes later. Around 3 minutes into the launch, an on-board camera showed numerous pieces of insulation foam break away from the fuel tank. However, they are not thought to have caused any damage to the shuttle. NASA's shuttle program chief N. Wayne Hale Jr. said the foam had fallen ""after the time we are concerned about."" This is the first time an American manned spacecraft has added its own launch fireworks to Fourth of July celebrations in the United States."
tech,"Astronomers at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy today announced their discovery of twelve further moons of Saturn, bringing the total number of moons discovered so far to 46. The initial discovery of the satellites was on December 12, 2004, and was made using the 8.2 metre Subaru telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory. Confirmational observations were then conducted throughout January, February, and March from the Subaru telescope and from the Gemini North telescope. Similar teams at the university led by David Jewitt discovered 11 moons of Jupiter in 2001, and a further 11 in 2002, before turning their attentions to Saturn. 11 of the newly discovered moons are in retrograde orbits, leading astronomers to hypothesize that they were originally asteroids, attracted out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter's gravity and then captured by Saturn. All of the moons are in inclined elliptical orbits, that range from 16 million to 22 million kilometres in distance from Saturn. As a point of reference, Earth's moon is an average of 384,403 kilometres from the Earth. The new moons of Saturn are provisionally named S/2004 S07 through to S/2004 S18."
tech,"InfosectionEnd NASA has given the 'ok' for the Space Shuttle Atlantis to land on Thursday September 21. NASA also says that there was ""no damage"" to the shuttle when astronauts spotted a piece of debris floating next to the shuttle. ""We are cleared for entry. Nothing was found to be missing or damaged from the thermal protection system, the heat shield of the space shuttle Atlantis, or, in fact, any other part of the shuttle Atlantis,"" said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle's program director. The debris is believed to be a piece of plastic from under the shuttle's heat tiles. A similar piece was seen by cameras falling from inbetween the heat shield tiles, but when the camera took another look, there was nothing to be found. Hale says that the source of the debris is unknown and that ""we NASA may never know"" where it came from. ""This is most likely the culprit. It was there before, it's not there now. It was most likely shaken loose during the flight control system checkout. We probably will never know for sure,"" added Hale. Astronauts used Atlantis's robotic arm to check the shuttle and its heat shield for any signs of damage."
tech,"NASA's Spirit Rover on Mars has found ""silica-rich soil"" in Gusev Crater that scientists say is so rich that it would require that water have been present at some point, in order for the deposits to be there. ""You could hear people gasp in astonishment. This is a remarkable discovery. And the fact that we found something this new and different after nearly 1,200 days on Mars makes it even more remarkable. It makes you wonder what else is still out there,"" said Steve Squyres, principal investigator for the Mars rovers' science instruments at Cornell University located in Ithaca, New York. The Martian soil was analyzed by Spirit's alpha particle X-ray spectrometer, and the soil was found to contain at least 90% pure silica. The findings were announced during a teleconference between Squyres and the other rovers' team members. But Spirit did not make this discovery on purpose. One of the six wheels on the rover is no longer functioning, and where ever Spirit goes, a deep gash is left in the soil in its wake. That is what caused the soil to be exposed and this discovery to be made. Spirit has made other discoveries using this 'method'. Spirit had previously found other indicators of long-ago water at the site, such as patches of water-bearing, sulfur-rich soil and alteration of minerals. ""This unexpected new discovery is a reminder that Spirit and Opportunity are still doing cutting-edge exploration more than three years into their extended missions. It also reinforces the fact that significant amounts of water were present in Mars' past, which continues to spur the hope that we can show that Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life."" The discovery is being called the best one yet to support the theory that Mars once had an abundance of water on it. ""This is some of the best evidence Spirit has found for water at Gusev,"" said a geochemist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Albert Yen who also added that this is the best indication so far that there could have been ""favorable conditions"" for there to have been life on Mars in the past. There are some interactions that scientists say could have caused the silica to be deposited, but all of them include water. One is that volcanic activity, which produces acid vapors, interacted with the water inside the soil. Another theory is an ancient hot spring located in the area. Both Spirit, and its partner rover Opportunity have both been in operation on Mars for almost 1,200 days. Both of the rovers finished their initial mission back in 2004, but both have been operating since and making new discoveries."
tech,"At 10:30pm on November 23, 2008, near the airport in McGregor, Texas, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) tested their new Falcon 9 rocket at full thrust for nearly 3 minutes (160 seconds). The engineers then shut down two of the nine engines &amp;mdash; in order to limit potential damage to the launch pad &amp;mdash; and continued the test for 18 more seconds before finally shutting the rocket down. ""We ran the engines just like they would run during flight, but instead of being up in the air, they were held down. They weren’t moving,"" said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX's manager for business development. This was the Falcon 9's first major test firing, and it marks a milestone for the company in its plans to capture a section of the commercial launch market. The test reportedly shook the windows of houses 5 miles away, causing agitation among residents who felt that they had not received adequate warning. ""I appreciate the fact that the company notified the City of McGregor, but did they not think the test would affect the surrounding communities?"" asked commenter Lorena Resident on the website for the Waco Tribune-Herald. Waco lies just east of McGregor. The Falcon 9 rocket, and its smaller sibling the Falcon 1, are the first rockets capable of entering Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to have their design be privately funded in its entirety. According to SpaceX the Falcon 9 can generate 4 times the maximum thrust of a Boeing 747 while firing in a vacuum, and will eventually be able to perform interplanetary missions in addition to its initial role as an orbital launch vehicle. SpaceX is also designing a crew and cargo capsule for the Falcon 9, which it has named the ""Dragon"". What do you think the future holds for SpaceX and commercial spaceflight in general?SpaceX is a contender for future commercial contracts from various government run space agencies, with NASA expressing particular interest. NASA will be retiring their fleet of Columbia Class Space Shuttles in 2010, but will not have the Shuttles' replacements (the Ares I and Ares V rockets) ready until at least 2014. NASA hopes to fill some of this gap using commercial launches from companies such as SpaceX. SpaceX has already reached an agreement with NASA to conduct three test flights of the Dragon capsule in conjunction with the Falcon 9. The first of these flights is expected in 2009. Elon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, said, ""The full mission-length test firing clears the highest hurdle for the Falcon 9 first stage before launch. In the next few months, we will have the first Falcon 9 flight vehicle on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, preparing for lift-off in 2009."" title2=Space"
tech,"SpaceThe Herschel Space Observatory and Planck Satellite were both launched Thursday by an Ariane 5ECA rocket at around 1pm (UTC) by the European Space Agency (ESA) from the Guiana Space Centre. The two telescopes valued at €1.9 billion (£1.7bn) were launched from Kourou, French Guiana, a department of France in South America. Planck Satellite ""The technology onboard these satellites is unique, and the science these satellites will do is fantastic,"" said Jean-Jacques Dordain director-general at the ESA, ""This is the result of many years' hard work by thousands of scientists and engineers across Europe."" Herschel was released 26 minutes after launch to continue on its trajectory. Two minutes later, the Planck observatory separated. The Planck telescope is a survey telescope using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. ""It Planck will allow us to pin down all the basic characteristics of the Universe with very high accuracy - its age, its contents, how it evolved, its geometry, etc."" said Dr Jan Tauber, project scientist at ESA. The larger space telescope is named after William Herschel who discovered the planet Uranus in 1781. The Herschel telescope will use infrared radiation and its main reflector mirror at a diameter of 3.5 meter (11.5 ft) is one-and-a-half-times larger than that on the Hubble Telescope. The Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) will also be able to detect carbon, water and oxygen in star-forming areas of space and examine the chemical composition of comets. The Photodetector Array Camera (PACS) and Spectrometer and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) will correlate the images. The Herschel will also be equipped with heat detecting instrumentation. The Herschel space telescope will be operational for three to five years. ""These space missions are outstanding feats of engineering. Herschel is the largest telescope we have ever put into space and the instruments on Planck will operate at just a tenth of a degree above absolute zero,"" said Lord Drayson, the United Kingdom's science minister, ""This is really cool science happening at mind-blowingly low temperatures, helping to answer some of the basic questions about the history of the universe."" ""Herschel is going to help us understand much, much better how stars form right now and how they have been forming throughout billions of years of cosmic history"" said Göran Pilbratt, Herschel's project scientist at ESA, ""We're going to see the star embryos, the ones that are not born yet. We're going to see right into the wombs where stars are born."""
tech,"Ion thruster (first considered by scientists in the 1950's). Previously this type of engine was only flown on Russian satellites, and this was the first time one has ever powered a craft beyond earth orbit. The thruster works by applying a large voltage across a magnetic coil, creating a strong magnetic field. This ionises the Xenon fuel supply which accelerates the ions to high speeds, pushing the craft forward. The propulsion of such an engine is around 3 times that of a normal chemical rocket. The thruster was powered by 2 solar panels on either side of the probe. The engine's small size and cost-efficiency helped keep down the mission budget. However there are drawbacks; for example, manoeuvres have to be carried out in long progressive burns rather than with short sharp bursts. A hall effect engine will also be used on the Bepi-Colombo mission to Mercury in 2013. Astronomers and scientists in ground observatories tracked the crash landing as it unfolded, controlled by the ESA staff from the Darmstadt centre, Germany. The Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii caught the impact on infrared cameras, seen as a bright flash as rock and soil became superheated. Elsewhere, results were less conclusive; in Florida thick clouds meant astronomers missed the event. One observer said: ""It would have been nice if it was clear, but that's the way astronomy works."" ESA sources say the mission was entirely successful in its aim to test new technology and obtain more data about the Moon. ""It was really a great mission for the agency,"" said mission manager Gerhard Schwehm, ""It was a technology demonstrator that grew up and provide lots of beautiful science data."""

I had just come out of the door when I noticed what was going on in the sky. There were a group of them - 10 to 15 of them moving together. My first impression was that they reminded me of a squadron of aeroplanes in formation. But they didn't have a proper formation and they were all moving at the same speed. I thought for a while that something was happening in the centre of London. Bombs and planes crossed my mind. But I realised very quickly that they didn't look like any aircraft I'd seen before. They were coming from the north and moving south. And then they kind of stopped and they were hovering. There was no sound. They seemed to fade away and I saw more coming and then they stopped. It lasted about 10 minutes."" The Contact International UFO Research organization was informed about the event by the Islington police and one of the witnesses. A spokesmen for the organization said that the witness had told them, ""He told me he was picking his daughter up from school and he saw many people looking up in the air.

tech,"Internet portal and mail-provider Lycos Europe has launched a program to increase spammers' bills by having thousands of voluntary users' computers repeatedly query websites from which spam originates. Such a tactic would increase the bandwidth costs for these websites. However, it also faces legal questions. Spamming, the mass sending of unsolicited emails, is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs, a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam. Volunteers may download the screensaver from the Lycos website for it. The program would run on a user's computer in the background and request about three megabytes (3MBs) of data every day. The screensaver shows which spam server is being targeted by the user, where the server is located, and how many others are attacking it at that moment. Target email servers are selected from blacklists from anti-spam organizations, with Lycos' own verification. Legal issues arise over whether this can be interpreted as a denial of service attack. In such an attack, computers overwhelm a webserver with requests for data to the point where it does not have the resources to fulfill its normal function. Lycos, in explanatory material on the screensaver's dedicated website ( http://makelovenotspam.com ), claims that its technology closely monitors the screensavers' effects on targeted websites and prevents any of them from being completely shut down by information requests. Lycos Europe operates in Germany where, according to Joerg Heidrich of Heise Zeitschriften Verlag, less than completely shutting down a server is not clearly illegal under the penal code. It may, however, be actionable under the civil code. But Lycos may be betting that no one will file a suit, as that would require those participating in illegal spamming to reveal their identity. The website no longer allows downloads of the screensaver, and users of the screensaver cannot connect to spam sites, but are instead given the message 'Stay Tuned'"

ICM Registry ICANN's decision means success for the Florida-based ICM Registry (ICM), the company that first applied for the .xxx domain in 2004. ICM will oversee the new domain and will sell the .xxx Web addresses. ICM hopes that the establishment of a .xxx domain will contribute a degree of predictability and security to the largely unrestrained world of Internet websites. Its chief executive, Stuart Lawley, said, ""For the first time, there will be a clearly defined Web address for adult entertainment, out of the reach of minors and as free as possible from fraud or malicious computer viruses."" The decision was criticized by some of the Internet pornography industry's biggest players who fear they could be the target of arbitrary censorship by governments and boards regulating the .xxx domain. Anti-pornography campaigners also criticized the move, saying it gives the sex industry legitimacy. But since the .xxx system and its vetting process is voluntary, popular pornographic sites are not likely to trade their .com domains for .xxx. Anti-porn critics say that users who think they are avoiding porn by filtering out .xxx domains will therefore be misled. ICM's Lawley saw only positive outcomes from the decision: ""Everybody wins. The consumer of adult sites wins. The providers will benefit because more people will become paying customers. And those who don't want to go there will win as well, because the sites will be easier to filter."""
tech,"A huge power outage occurred in Moscow today. The failure in the accumulative power supply system in Mosenergo which occurred at 11:15 a.m. local time on Wednesday, led to a power outage in all areas of the city. Power for lights failed in apartment buildings. Some lines of the Moscow underground stopped for four hours. Trams and trolley buses, electric trains of the Moscow railway also stopped. Hundreds of people were trapped in apartment building lifts. In addition to lighting problems, the homeowners have also lost their water supply, as pumping stations in Mosvodokanal also lost power because of the failure. 15 big cities and five areas of Moscow suburbs, some areas of the Tula and Kaluga areas were left without electricity. At 12:00 noon, food shops in the affected areas started closing. In shops where sellers continued trading, huge queues accumulated. To avoid panic at train stations, workers with megaphones informed passengers of train movements. At train stations, reserve power supplies are being used. According to eyewitnesses, there was no electric lighting at many stations and in transitions between them. Escalators also did not work. clear Thursday morning trolley buses and trams still do not work in southern areas of Moscow. Despite repair work conducted during the night, it was impossible to power all trolleybus and tram lines. In total 8 tram and 25 trolleybus routes do not work. Buses will take over those routes. Besides this, in the south of Moscow there are still many disconnected apartment houses. All stations of the Moscow underground are working normally. All trains are running on schedule. The entrance to Moscow for supersize automobiles will be limited up to 14 o'clock in the afternoon. The limitation was put in place yesterday because of difficult road conditions in the city after the power failure. The head of Minpromenergo (Ministry of Industries and Energy) Victor Hristenko, addressing to the deputies of the State Duma, has declared that the cause of failure of the electrical system was in the Central region of Russia because of a fire and an explosion on the substation of Mosenergo named ""Chagino"", located in Kapotnya. As a result of a cascade power outage on Wednesday, 25th May, 53 Moscow substations have been disconnected. 46 from them have started working by 23.00, Wednesday, six more - by 6.00, Thursday. According to the deputy head of the Russian Joint Stock Company ""Unified Energy System of Russia"" (RAO UESR) Andrey Trapeznikov, some reasons of failure are considered. He said that the failure of one of substations of the Russian Open Society ""United Power Systems"" was a cause. Later in the morning, when people were work, air conditioners were turned on. Consequently, the system could not handle the overload, and started the cascade shutdown of consumers of the electric power. Trapeznikov has noted that scales of the failure could of been much more serious. The further switching-off was stopped by substations of Tula and Kaluga which had sustained the overload. The head of the RAO UESR Anatoly Chubays has made apologies for the inconveniences caused to inhabitants of Moscow, Tula and Kaluga areas. He said: ""The failure is on our conscience, it is our mistake""."
tech,"Space American astronaut, Randolph Bresnik, is in orbit over 200 miles above the Earth, where he learned of the birth of his daughter Abigail. Lieutenant Colonel Bresnik becomes only the second man to have become a father while in space. Onboard Atlantis this morning, the crew were woken by mission control playing Butterfly Kisses, a song chosen by Bresnik's wife Rebecca. Prior to launch, Bresnik joked about the birth expected while on his eleven day mission with the Shuttle, ""this is a pretty good excuse for missing the birth and hopefully she will forgive me later on"". The first-ever father in space was astronaut Mike Fincke in 2004. Atlantis's current mission is scheduled to return to Earth this coming Friday, having resupplied the International Space Station and carried out two separate spacewalks. This will be the first time astronaut Bresnik gets to see the newest addition to his family. The couple live in Houston with their adopted three year-old son from Ukraine."
tech,"space On Wednesday, George Djorgovski and collaborators reported in the journal Nature on an unusual light signal they say suggests two supermassive black holes are merging, a phenomenon never seen before, though theorized. The discovery could clarify how black holes merge and galaxies evolve, and could also provide a better understanding of the so-called ""final parsec problem"" &amp;mdash; the inability of theories to predict how, or even how quickly, the final phases of black hole mergers happen. The team discovered the light coming from quasar PG 1302-102 in data from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CTRS), which is able to study light sources from four fifths of the night sky using three ground-based US and Australian telescopes. Coauthor and Caltech computational scientist Matthew Graham emphasized the final stages of these black hole mergers are not well understood. CTRS has so far identified 20 quasars with similar signals, but Graham said this one is the best example because it has a clear signal that recurs about every five years, similar to a sine wave (see the 2D graph shown on the left)."
tech,"InfosectionEnd Astronauts on NASA's Space Shuttle Atlantis have repaired a 4 inch tear in the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). At 1:00 p.m. ET astronauts began their third spacewalk to repair the tear by using medical staples to seal the torn area. Astronauts tucked the material back into place and then stapled up the seams where the material was torn. But the repair did not go without flaws. Astronauts repairing the tear say that the tear line was ""higher than expected,"" according to radio transmissions heard live on NASA TV. Astronauts also report that the area where the tear was present is ""well worn away"" and because of that, no staples were able to be placed on the top side of the blanket near the top of the tear, leaving a small ""gap"" between the seams. Two rows of staples were placed along the tear to hold the blanket in place. Atlantis received the 4 inch tear on its TPS on one of the Orbital Maneuvering System pods near the thrusters during take-off on June 8."
tech,"The United States military has announced their intention to use a missile to destroy USA-193, a spy satellite which failed immediately after launch in December 2006. Since launch, the satellite's orbit has decayed and it is approaching the point at which it will re-enter the atmosphere and potentially fall to Earth. The missile will be used as a kinetic anti-satellite weapon (ASAT), and will destroy the satellite through hitting it at high speed. The satellite potentially has hazardous materials on board, including hydrazine. Ordinarily, the hydrazine would be used as fuel, but since the satellite failed immediately after launch, this was never used. It is expected that about half of the satellite would be capable of surviving re-entry, potentially including the fuel tank. Since hydrazine is toxic, the satellite could pose a severe danger if it hits in a populated area, however it has been considered likely that the tank would probably rupture and explode during re-entry. Destroying the satellite on the grounds of safety is the stated purpose of shooting down the satellite. Officials have denied claims that it is to prevent secrets that the satellite is carrying from falling into the wrong hands, or that it is a demonstration in response to a Chinese ASAT test in January 2007. The missile which will be used to shoot down the satellite will be a Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), which will be launched from the USS Lake Erie in the North Pacific Ocean. The missile, which was designed to shoot down other missiles, will be modified slightly in order to allow it to recognise USA-193 as its target. If the attack is successful, the satellite will be broken into many small pieces. This will eliminate the hazard from the hydrazine and break into small enough pieces that nothing will survive reentry. Officials reported that the likelihood of success was ""high"". NASA Administrator Michael Griffin said that it was impossible to make the situation any worse. Missing the satellite would change nothing, while a slight blow would still result in the satellite returning to Earth, and a direct hit would destroy the satellite. It is believed that the missile will be aimed directly at the satellite's fuel tank. While the debris will not pass near enough to the International Space Station to cause disruption, it is not clear whether it could affect spacecraft passing through the lower orbit in which USA-193 currently resides. For this reason, the satellite will not be destroyed until the Space Shuttle Atlantis, which is currently conducting mission STS-122, has landed. The debris caused by the satellite's destruction is expected to re-enter the atmosphere within a few weeks."
tech,"Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov have just completed their mission's first space walk aboard the International Space Station. The mission lasted 5 hours, 28 minutes, ending at 1311 UTC. The two astronauts, working in Russian space suits, performed a variety of tasks. Chiao and Sharipov installed a work platform, called the Universal Work Platform, along with its base and associated wiring. They also installed a commercial robotics experiment and a biological experiment on the exterior of the Zvezda Service Module. In addition, they checked vents on systems that help control the Station's atmosphere and relocated a Japanese physical science experiment. Residue accumulation around the vents of the Elektron oxygen generator was noted and photographed by Sharipov. Technicians on the ground will analyze the information to determine if this residue has been contributing to the problematic operation of the Elektron. During this spacewalk, the station again encountered the mysterious forces that have been saturating the Control Moment Gyros during previous spacewalks. Russian thrusters were activated to counter this force. The walk marks Chiao's fifth for 31 hours, 34 minutes, accumulated time and Shapirov's first. This was the 57th space walk conducted at the Station and the 32nd to be based out of the orbital outpost. Expedition 10 is scheduled to conduct its second spacewalk in March."
tech,"India's recently launched satellites, the 1560 kg Indian Remote Sensing satellite, CARTOSAT-1 for stereoscopic cartographic applications and 42.5 kg HAMSAT will have a longer life as per the Project Director, PSLV, N Narayana Murthy. Murthy told reporters that the additional fuel in the satellites for putting them into the right orbit can now be utilized for orbit maintenance maneuvers. This is due to their precise injection into the orbit by the PSLV-C6 Launcher. PSLV-C6 was launched by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on May 5, 2005 10:15 IST (May 05, 04:45 UT). PSLV-C6 placed both the satellites in polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) at an altitude of 632 x 621 km with an inclination of 97.8 deg with respect to the equator. The solar panels of CARTOSAT-1 were deployed soon after its injection into orbit. CARTOSAT-1 is the eleventh satellite in the Indian remote sensing satellite series and is intended for cartographic applications. It carries two panchromatic cameras that take black-and-white stereoscopic pictures in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. HAMSAT is a Micro-satellite for providing satellite based Amateur Radio services to the Indian as well as International community of Amateur Radio Operators (HAM)."
tech,"The controversial European Union Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions, also called the ""software patent directive"" has been put to rest for 2004. The directive was expected to easily pass through the European Council's Fisheries Council on Tuesday, December 21, but was removed from the agenda at the request of Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski. The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005. Software developers, who supported the European Parliament's proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&amp;1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move. ""The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage!"" said Mueller in a press release. ""Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year."" Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year. ""We were well aware that the current proposal has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament,"" Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement. ""We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year."" On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a ""Common Position"" on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year. The Council vote generated a lot of controversy. Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote. According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable. The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes."
tech,"The robotic arm scoop on the Phoenix lander on Mars has made its first impression on the red planet, leaving behind a mark that resembles a human footprint. It began its first dig on Saturday, May 31, and the camera on board the arm caught an image. ""This first touch allows us to utilize the Robotic Arm accurately. We are in a good situation for the upcoming sample acquisition and transfer,"" stated Phoenix's surface mission manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, David Spencer. Scientists named the initial impression Yeti in an area they describe as 'The King of Hearts'. NASA has decided to name the various tasks and operations performed by Phoenix after fairy tale and mythological characters. On Friday May 30, 2008, the same camera captured images of what appears to be ice under the lander. Scientists, who named the exposed area Snow Queen, say that as Phoenix landed the exhaust from its thrusters cleared away a three- to four-inch layer of Martian soil which exposed a flat layer of a white substance that NASA says could be ice. The image shows the white layer which is shiny and smooth. Scientists expect to find more of the alleged ice when Phoenix begins its digging mission not far from the initial test dig. ""What we see in the images is in agreement with the notion that it may be ice, and we suspect we will see the same thing in the digging area,"" stated Uwe Keller, Robotic Arm Camera lead scientist for Phoenix. Phoenix is searching for evidence of water and microbial life on Mars. Its mission is to determine Mars's ability or inability to host life and hold water. The Phoenix lander uses a robotic arm to dig through the protective top soil layer to the alleged water ice below and ultimately bring both soil and water ice to the lander platform for sophisticated scientific analysis."
tech,"Manchester Magistrates' court in the UK yesterday jailed a self-described online troll for posting messages to Facebook tribute pages. Colm Coss, 36, was sentenced to eighteen weeks in prison after admitting breaching the Communications Act of 2003. Coss targeted a page in tribute to the late Jade Goody, made famous by reality TV show Big Brother, as well as a page dedicated to young Liverpool dog-attack victim John Paul Massey. Overseas deceased were also targeted, with Coss trolling tributes to a Canadian murder victim, an Australian road accident fatality and a dead US citizen. Coss was arrested after he sent typed letters to neighbours containing photographs of himself and explaining he was ""a troll"". Although he initially refused to cooperate, Coss later wrote to a police officer and admitted posting the messages, in some of which he said he had had sex with the bodies of the deceased or claimed to have engaged in fictional acts of paedophilia. ""The harm and upset that this can cause is obvious,"" according to Paul Mitchell, prosecuting Coss. Coss was charged with 'sending malicious communications that were grossly offensive', entering a guilty plea last month. Yesterday, defence lawyer Leanne Press sought investigation of her client's psychiatric state prior to sentencing, arguing he ""had a history of mental health issues."" However, magistrates decided he could be sentenced without this. Magistrate Pauline Salisbury noted sentencing guidelines of twelve weeks imprisonment, but said the offences were serious enough to warrant 26 weeks. Eight weeks were shaved off the sentence owing to his guilty plea."
tech,"clearright The screen shot above shows several renderings of the Acid 2 CSS test, used to identify web page rendering flaws in web browsers and HTML authoring tools: *Green &amp;mdash; Optimal (Konqueror) *Yellow &amp;mdash; Firefox 1.5 *Red &amp;mdash; Internet Explorer 7 The long awaited Internet Explorer 7.0 beta preview was released to the public on January 31. Large amounts of the architecture, including the security framework, have been completely overhauled. Partly as a result of these security enhancements, the browser will be a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell. The final Beta 2 is scheduled by Microsoft to be released in April, with the full version scheduled for the Summer of 2006. According to Microsoft's announcement, the beta will only run on Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems, but the final release version is intended to be able to run on Windows Vista, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 as well. Version 7 includes a number of new features. * Improved rendering engine - Internet Explorer's rendering engine, codenamed Trident has been completely rewritten to compete with the faster rendering engines of Opera and Firefox. * Tabbed Browsing - users can now have several web pages in the same window via ""tabs"". * Quick Tabs - enables users to view thumbnail images of all open tabs in one view. * Tab Groups - enables users to organize multiple tabs in the same category as a single Tab Group that can be saved as a Favorite and the user can open all the sites in the Tab Group with a single click on the arrow to the right of the folder. * Page zoom - enables users to increase or decrease the page size for easier viewing. * IDN support * RSS Support - Version 7.0 now supports RSS, which allows users to gather ""news feeds"" from web sites that have RSS support. Microsoft implements RSS in a shared library, known as a DLL, so that third party developers can develop their own RSS-enabled applications. * Alpha transparency - Version 7.0 now has native support for PNG alpha transparency. This allows certain image (PNGs) to have opaque areas that can blend in with other images and text. * OpenSearch Extensions - Users of version 7.0 can now use search engines by typing in search terms directly from the browser's toolbar. * Administration improvements - All previous and new features are manageable via Group Policy, including the Phishing Filter and all browser add-ons. * Improved CSS support - Version 7.0 has improved CSS support, which means Internet Explorer will now render pages closer to the method defined by the W3C, a standards body for World Wide Web technologies. This means web page designers and developers will have an easier time designing web sites and applications to look the same on all web browsers. * Improved AJAX functionality - Applications that use a web development technique called AJAX to make interactive web applications will run more efficiently because Microsoft has included support for its main component, the XMLHttpRequest Object, into the browser. Previous versions of Internet Explorer required a helper application, called an ActiveX Object to implement this functionality (a good example of an AJAX application is Google's popular Google Maps application. * Enhanced security - Microsoft has attempted to fix a number of security issues with how Internet Explorer behaves. This includes: ** Protected Mode - In Protected Mode, Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is completely unable to modify user or system files and settings. ** Internet Explorer 7.0 is a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell like version 6.0. This means that you can no longer open a folder, type in a URL and get a web page. ** URL Handling Protections. ** Protection Against Cross-Domain Scripting Attacks. ** Anti-Phishing and Anti-Spoofing filters. ** Security Status Bar - color-coded visual and icons cues to the safety and trustworthiness of a Web site. The current release is intended for compatibility testing by developers and IT professionals, and is not aimed at the general public."

Now the EU has moved to the next stage of legal action, which could see Britain taken to court. The warning follows complaints over the Phorm company's targeted advertising system. The controversial technology is designed to track the activities of internet users, and was tested on some BT customers without their consent. Campaigners complained to various bodies including the UK's data protection agency, and the communications regulator Ofcom. No action was taken. The City of London police began an investigation, but this was soon dropped. source=Viviane Reding, EU Information Commissioner The EU Commission formally warned Britain that it was not meeting EU rules in April. Other countries that have been warned include Germany, Poland and Romania. However, last week the Commission moved onto the second stage of the infringement procedure against the UK, with a letter to the government. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) has been particularly criticised by the Commission for its weak definition of ""consent"" and its limited sanctions. The Commission also found that there was no independent body to oversee and hear complaints about communications interception. Overall, the letter says that the UK fails to comply with the EU's Data Protection Directive and e-Privacy Directive. ""People's privacy and the integrity of their personal data in the digital world is not only an important matter: it is a fundamental right, protected by European law,"" the EU's Information Commissioner Viviane Reding said in a statement on Thursday.

tech,"A jewel that once belonged to King Tutankhamen of ancient Egypt is believed to have been created by an exploding meteorite entering Earth's atmosphere ""hugely bigger in energy than the atomic bomb tests,"" said geophysicist John Wasson. The explosion was ""Ten thousand times more powerful,"" added Wasson. The Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority says the jewel is composed of 98% silica or glass, making it the purest jewel of its kind on the planet and can only be found in a certain area of the Sahara Desert. Wasson also says the impact that created the jewel can be compared to the ""Tunguska event"" that occurred in Tunguska, Siberia in 1908 causing at least 80 million trees to be flattened, but left no visible impact crater. ""When the thought came to me that it required a hot sky, I thought immediately of the Tunguska event,"" said Wasson. 2006-07-25 The event was recreated by a computer simulation. The results of the simulation reveal that the impact of a meteorite or an event similar to Tunguska could have been the cause of the formation and heating the ground up to nearly 1,800 degrees Celsius causing a thin layer of glass to form on the Earth's surface at the site of an impact. Researchers also added that events like this are likely to happen at least every 100 years or so. Wasson says there are likely to be more impacts; it's ""just a matter of when."""
tech,"NASA scientists say that the Arctic Sea's icecap is melting and that the icecap is melting fast. According to images captured by NASA's QuikSCAT satellite, the Arctic icecap has lost at least 14% of its 'perennial' ice between 2004 and 2005. Data shows that at least 280,000 square miles of ice, at least the size of Texas has been lost. The eastern Arctic has lost at least 50% of its ice, but scientists say that ice was shifted by wind and other weather factors from the east to the west Arctic, causing the western areas of ice to actually grow. Between October 2005 and April of 2006; however, the icecap lost an additional 70% of frozen water. Between 04 and 05, the perennial ice, which is supposed to remain frozen year-round, was replaced by 'seasonal' ice, which scientists say melts faster during the Summer months. This event has never before been witnessed. Perennial ice is normally 3 meters (10 feet) thick or more and seasonal ice is only 0.3 meters (1 feet) to 2 meters (7 feet) thick. ""If the seasonal ice in the east Arctic Ocean were to be removed by summer melt, a vast ice-free area would open up. Such an ice-free area would have profound impacts on the environment, as well as on marine transportation and commerce,"" said Son Nghiem, the leader of research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. For several decades, the icecap has melted about 0.7% a year during the Summer months and has increased at least ""18 times"" faster than past decades, but Nghiem also said that the icecap has melted with ""some variability"" over the past years and was at times a ""much smaller"" of a loss of ice. ""If we average that over the long term we find a reduction of between 6.4% and 7.8% per decade. What we have here is 14% in one year - 18 times the previous rate. In previous years there is some variability, but it is much smaller and regional. The changes between 2004 and 2005 is enormous,"" added Nghiem. Global warming is believed to have played a role in melting the ice. ""It has never occurred before in the past. It is alarming. ... This winter ice provides the kind of evidence that it is indeed associated with the greenhouse effect,"" said Josefino Comiso, another NASA researcher and scientist."
tech,"A collaboratively-developed operating system kernel known as GNU Hurd has been made bootable using the L4 microkernel, which provides room for significant speed improvements over an existing implementation using the Mach microkernel. The newer architecture also has a more lively developer community. Developer Marcus Brinkmann made the historic step and finished the process initialization code, which enabled him to execute the first software on Hurd-L4. In a message to the L4 port of GNU Hurd mailing list, Brinkmann wrote, ""We can now easily explore and develop the system in any way we want. The dinner is prepared!"". However, the kernel's current feature set is very limited. ""With my glibc port, I can already build simple applications, but most won't run because they need a filesystem or other gimmicks (like, uhm, fork and exec), and I only have stubs (dummy functions which always return an error) for that now,"" he added in a later posting. Compared with Linux and BSD Unix's monolithic kernel architecture, a microkernel based operating system provides developers greater modularity and isolation from hardware, a big win with L4 already being available for a large number of hardware varieties. There is a cost in speed for such abstraction, and this cost was higher on Mach, at around 15%, compared with only around 5% on L4 and it's predecessor L3, both developed by Dr. Jochen Liedtke. The greater modularity and abstraction of a microkernel approach means that the microkernel itself does not need constant modification as is seen in the Linux kernel today, since it provides only the very minimum of services, and does so very carefully. Thus, the fact that L4 was developed in 1996 is seen as exemplifying this stability -- rather than showing its age -- since few, if any, improvements in approach have been imagined in the meantime. However, the Mach kernel first developed ten years earlier at Carnegie Mellon University is seen as a flawed first implementation, with the lessons learned being implemented in microkernels like L4, known as second-generation microkernels. The GNU Hurd forms the base of the GNU operating system, much of which has been widely adopted by users of other Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. The GNU Project has been developing the Hurd since 1983. In 1990, the GNU Project decided to use the Mach kernel, rather than writing their own. The Hurd is released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The Hurd kernel is an experiment which aims to surpass existing Unix kernels in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them. It currently runs on Intel IA32 machines. According to the GNU Hurd project, ""The Hurd should, and probably will, be ported to other hardware architectures or other microkernels in the future"" . `Hurd' stands for `Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons'. And, then, `Hird' stands for `Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth' - perhaps the first software to be named by a pair of mutually recursive acronyms. A limited port of Linux already runs on L4, known as L4Linux."
tech,"Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25. Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday. Cooper found the prime as a participant in the distributed computing project known as the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS. Cooper runs the GIMPS client, called Prime95, on an estimated 1,000 computers at the university. The number was first reported to the GIMPS server on January 25 from a university computer which had been running 39 days non-stop. However as for any Mersenne prime candidates, the discovery was announced after several people have verified the number using different hardware and software. The three independent verifications took from three to seven days of computation on powerful hardware. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can only be evenly divided by 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19. 77 (for example) is not prime because it is a product of 7 and 11. The newly discovered prime is expressed as 257,885,161 − 1 and has 17,425,170 digits. It is a specific type of prime number called a Mersenne prime, which are of the form 2p − 1. The exponent p must be prime for the number to be prime. As of February 2013, there are only 48 known Mersenne primes. George Woltman developed and founded GIMPS, the longest known continuously running computer project, in 1996. Cooper as a participant had previously discovered two other Mersenne primes, 230,402,457 − 1 in December 2005 and 232,582,657 − 1 in September 2006, with fellow professor Steven Boone. This latest discovery ends an intermission of almost four years; the previous Mersenne prime was found in April 2009."

The Commission also forced Microsoft to produce a version of Windows XP that did not include Windows Media Player. Only 1,787 copies were ordered through March 31st. Microsoft has also alleged that the proposed punishment of 2 million euros per day is too severe. The EU has also proposed that Microsoft's upcoming operating system, Windows Vista will also exclude rivals through bundling programs. Although a decision is not expected for at least several months, analysts have predicted that a verdict in favor of Microsoft would destroy the EU Commission's prestige as well as any case against Microsoft. 2006-04-25"
tech,"__NOTOC__ 2008 Taipei Game Show The 2008 Taipei Game Show, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), ended on Monday, and was different from shows of past years. This could be seen in the gaming population, industry, and exhibition arrangements. To encourage the participation of the public, not only participants (exhibitors), but also the organizers held lots of on-site events including the ""Taiwan Local Game Championship"", ""Gaming Adventure Area"", and several stage events during the show. With many gaming experts and visitors participating in the several events, the gaming population has progressively matured. Especially in the ""Popular Game &amp; Company Voting"" category, the public apparently viewed the gaming industry on the bright side as the OBMs (game production companies) produced many ""excellence"" products and marketed them around the world. Since Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan Limited (SCE Taiwan) was established in December 2007, SCE Taiwan has participated in the 2007 Taipei IT Month to rearrange their styles from marketing and cross-industry cooperations. They finally decided to participate in the 2008 Taipei Game Show and to battle with Microsoft Taiwan by challenging different premiums and plans. Sony rival, Microsoft Taiwan, sought to gain popularity and notability at this show. Microsoft preliminary moved their new game launch from the 3C store to the TWTC again, since 2007. Also, they invited their spokespeople ""Mayday"" to get more visitors to visit the show. They won all of the categories of the popular presentation class. After a battle between the two main world-class companies, Microsoft &amp; Sony not only showed different cultures from exhibition arrangements and product presentations but successfully marketed their indicative products in consuming and high-definition markets. Some local OBMs like Softstar Entertainment, International Games Systems (IGS), GameFlier Station, UserJoy Technology, and others showed their versatility by participating, not only in the (B2B) trade area for international buyers but also the consumer (B2C) area for local visitors. Those participants not only tried to get important orders from buyers but also invited many notable entertainers and sportsmen to the B2C area to strengthen the notability of released games. It helped launch the return of the gaming population, arrangements in the B2B area, and the most important - virtuous competition from the ""Popular Game and Company Voting"" category. Since the ""Charity Bidding Pavilion"" was created in the past year and recommended by local NGOs and disadvantaged organizations, the TCA planned to cooperate with the Taipei Orphans Welfare Association, and the Taiwan Gaming Industry Association (TGIA) to help orphan kids this year again. As of TCA's information in 2007, corporate participants of the TGIA have ""adopted"" several orphans and accompanied them to grow up in healthy conditions before the show. The companies and organizers were successful in turning the public image of the Taipei Game Show from ""a simple consumer show"" to ""a mixed show with welfare and charity"" this year.

tech,"Scientists say that the rock that fell through the roof of a house in Freehold Township, New Jersey this week was a meteorite and was likely over a billion years old. The meteorite is currently owned by the same family whose house it hit; the names of the family members have not been released and no one inside the home was injured. The meteorite is named ""Freehold Township"" after the township it landed in. Although scientists have not yet been able to take samples of the rock, they have looked at it and say the rock is likely made of iron due to its ""density, magnetic properties, markings and coloration"", and probably a piece of a much larger asteroid. The rock weighs approximately 13 ounces (about .37 kilograms), which is little more than the weight of a can of soup. ""It's a pretty exciting find,"" said one scientist who has examined the rock, Jeremy S. Delaney. ""It's a good candidate for the core of an asteroid,"" added Delaney."
tech,"Horia Teodorescu, a student in 10th grade at Costache Negruzzi College in Iaşi, northeastern Romania, won the annual worldwide NASA Space Settlement Design Contest. The contest is sponsored by the Fundamental Space Biology Program of the United States' space agency, NASA. The task of the contest is for students to develop designs for a permanent orbital space colony. For his design, Teodorescu was awarded a visit to a NASA base in the USA. Concerning the contest, Teodorescu said, ""I designed a space colony which is called 'Temis', a personification of the Greek goddess of wisdom. The project is made up of four parts."" He said that the development of the space colony in his design has two phases - ""Firstly, there is the construction period, in which the Moon is used as a base for extracting and processing materials. This would last about one year. After that, there would be a period of 4-5 years, in which the population of the colony would reach 10,000."" In 15 years, Teodorescu projects in his design that the population would reach 100,000, and reach the stage where the colony would be able to sustain itself and to start developing its own economic, social and educational systems. During the design's conception, Teodorescu was aided by his teachers, Adrian Koriloff, Margareta Constantinescu, Nicolae Hirtan and Lucia Miron, as well as his father Horia Neculai Teodorescu, who is a professor at the Iaşi University. Teodorescu also participated in the same contest in 2004, where he received second place. The first prize was also obtained by Romanians, more precisely a group of students from Constanţa. The Costache Negruzzi College, founded in 1895, is, with over 1500 students, the largest secondary education facility in Iaşi, a city of 320,000 people."

NASA officials also say that the shuttle, launch pad and facilities at the space center suffered no damage from tropical depression Ernesto. ""We had no damage. Zero. Nada. We fully anticipate being ready to go as early as September 6,"" said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for NASA's Kennedy Space Center. ""There was no water intrusion in any operational areas, and so basically we came through this one unscathed,"" said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for NASA. If any delay causes the shuttle not to launch on Wednesday, NASA will attempt another launch two days from Wednesday. A bolt of lightning struck the launch pad which caused NASA to delay the shuttle launch. No damage was sustained when the bolt hit."
tech,"Space US President Barack Obama unveiled on Thursday plans for the future of American space exploration, committing to sending American astronauts to Mars by the mid-2030s. The president was speaking at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a speech to lay out his plans for the future of American space agency NASA. His comments included assurances that America was not abandoning space exploration, contrary to claims he was doing so after he announced the US's budget for 2011, which would have ended most of NASA's current projects, including the development of new heavy-launch rockets called the Constellation Program. 4=US President Barack Obama Under Obama's latest program, NASA would receive US $6 billion as supplementary funding over the next five years to develop new projects, which Obama emphasized, saying NASA was in the unusual position of having an expanded budget while other government agencies must comply to financial restrictions or cuts in efforts to reduce the US public debt. With the additional funding, NASA would extend the life of the International Space Station (ISS) by four years further, to at least 2020, design a new series of heavy-lift rockets by 2015, and continue development of the Orion crew capsule, a major part of the Constellation program. Initially, the capsule would serve only as a rescue vehicle for the ISS, but would later serve as the ""technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions."" The proposed project would also retain plans for private operators to service the ISS, despite criticism that such operators were not reliable enough for the task. The centerpiece of the plan would be manned missions to the moon and beyond, beginning with missions to asteroids around 2025, with missions to Mars following within a decade. Initially, Mars missions would consist of sending humans to orbit Mars, with missions to land on the surface of the planet coming shortly after. Obama said that under the plan, ""we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do."" Obama said that under his new plan, NASA would be able to achieve more in a shorter amount of time than it would have under the Constellation Program. He also said that, contrary to fears that changes in NASA would result in job losses in Florida, where most space missions are launched from, under his new plan, a total of 2,500 jobs would be created in the area. The new plan would, according to Obama, lead to ""major breakthroughs"" in the US space program. He said that the goal of the new program would be ""no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite."" The president also emphasized the need for continued innovation, saying that ""we’ve got to do it space exploration in a smart way and we can’t just keep on doing the same old things we’ve been doing and thinking that’s going to get us where we want to go."""
tech,"NASA's Phoenix Lander has begun to cook a scoop full of Martian soil. For reasons unknown to scientists, and after several seemingly unsuccessful attempts to break up the soil, a large amount was discovered to have passed through a screen leading to an on board oven. ""We have an oven full. It took 10 seconds to fill the oven. The ground moved,"" said Phoenix co-investigator Bill Boynton, a researcher at the University of Arizona located in Tucson, Arizona. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called ""Baby Bear"" to the number 4 oven on its TEGA (Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer) last Friday, June 6. NASA observed the method and reported that no soil had passed through the screens over the TEGA. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. The oven's goal is to vaporize any ice or water that may be present in the soil. Minerals may also burn off and scientists say that vapors from anything that evaporates or vaporizes will be tested and analyzed. After some debate, NASA decided to 'shake' the soil in hopes that it would break up the larger particles. To much disappointment after six tries using this method, only a few particles got through the screen. Scientists then ordered one last shake of the soil ""in the off chance we might get lucky,"" stated Boynton. After a few days of troubleshooting, NASA looked back at the soil and discovered that, for an unknown reason, a large amount of soil had fallen through the screen and was ready for inspection by the TEGA. Boynton states that it is possible that the oven might have filled because of the cumulative effects of all the shaking, or because of changes in the soil's cohesiveness as it sat for days on the top of the screen. ""There's something very unusual about this soil, from a place on Mars we've never been before. We're interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together,"" Boynton commented. Phoenix was originally ordered to put off using its TEGA until scientists came up with a solution to the clodded soil. It had been rescheduled to take readings of the Martian climate such as temperature and wind speed, and also to analyze a soil sample using the optical microscope, or MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) on June 12. Scientists say that those tasks are still scheduled to take place. Pictures and results from that sample are expected to arrive on Thursday June 12, while the oven samples will take a few days to analyze. ""The dirt finally did start to flow and we actually got a full oven, so that problem is now behind us. We're hopeful that some time in the next few days we'll close the oven and begin the analysis process,"" added Boynton."
tech,"computing Yesterday, the Russian chatterbot ""Eugene Goostman"" by a team of Russian and Ukrainian developers became the first machine to pass a Turing test, under the academic event organizers' interpretation of the test as originally described by British mathematician Alan Turing. The competition was held at the Royal Society in London, England, and was organized by Kevin Warwick and Huma Shah of the University of Reading to mark the 60th anniversary of Turing's death on June 7, 1954. The Turing test is a test of artificial intelligence aiming to fulfil the suggestion of Alan Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", which stated that within fifty years, an ""average interrogator"" would, following a five-minute long conversation, ""not have more than 70 per cent chance"" of correctly predicting whether they are speaking to a human, or a machine &amp;mdash; which would be able to, as such, fool at least 30% of human judges into thinking it is human. In the contest, where Eugene Goostman and four other bots competed, the bot successfully tricked 33% of the participating judges, which included television actor Robert Llewellyn of the BBC television series Red Dwarf, and John Sharkey, Baron Sharkey, a sponsor of Turing's 2013 posthumous pardon. To give the bot a ""believable personality"", Goostman is portrayed as being a thirteen year-old boy of the Ukraine; the bot's head developer Vladimir Veselov stated that this made Goostman ""not too old to know everything and not too young to know nothing"". The bot had previously come close to beating the Turing test on several occasions; it has been a three-time runner-up for the Loebner Prize, and it won a Turing contest at Bletchley Park in 2012, held to mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth. In the 2012 Bletchley Park competition Goostman was, notably, only one percent away from the target of 30%. Speaking about the achievement, Warwick stated: ""Some will claim that the Test has already been passed. The words Turing Test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. A true Turing Test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's Test was passed for the first time on Saturday."" Veselov felt that the achievement was ""remarkable"", and suggested that it could help increase interest in artificial intelligence and chatterbot technology."
tech,"United Kingdom The Metropolitan Police, a British police force based in the capital city of London, has announced its intention to commence a new investigation related to allegations of computer hacking. The force has received numerous allegations of computer and email hacking relating to journalists since January of this year, prompting the launch of the probe, codenamed Operation Tuleta. According to a spokesperson for Scotland Yard, computer hacking allegations have already been brought into account, but now, ""some aspects of that operation are being moved towards investigation"". These allegations occurred during Operation Weeting, which has investigated alleged phone hacking offences. The Metropolitan Police said that the computer hacking claims were not within the remit of the phone hacking allegation probe, so a separate investigation had to be launched. Operation Tuleta consists of a fresh team of detectives, who will provide information to Operation Weeting deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers. Meanwhile, the legal representatives for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator for the former British publication News of the World (NotW) have stated that he was proceeding ""on the instructions of others"". Sara Payne, the mother of the murdered girl Sarah Payne, was informed that Mulcaire possibly hacked into her phone and gathered her contact information. Payne was said to be ""very distressed and upset"" by the allegations. Mulcaire was sentenced to prison in January 2007 along with Clive Goodman, the royal editor for the NotW. The final edition of the NotW was published this July, amid the phone hacking scandal within News Corporation. A public inquiry relating to the affair was launched, triggered by allegations of phone hacking and police corruption."

tech,"Environment A recent study by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the oil and gas industry are creating earthquakes. New information from the Midwest region of the United States points out that these man-made earthquakes are happening more frequently than expected. While more frequent earthquakes are less of a problem for regions like the Midwest, a geology professor from the University of Southern Indiana, Dr. Paul K. Doss, believes the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing (or ""fracking"") process used in extracting oil and gas has the possibility to pose potential problems for groundwater. ""We are taking this fluid that has a whole host of chemicals in it that are useful for fracking and putting it back into the Earth,"" Doss said. ""From a purely seismic perspective these are not big earthquakes that are going to cause damage or initiate, as far as we know, any larger kinds of earthquakes activity for Midwest. The issue is a water quality issue in terms of the ground water resources that we use."" Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique used by the oil and gas industries which inject highly pressurized water down into the Earth's crust to break rock and extract natural gas. Most of the fluids used for fracking are proprietary, so information about what chemicals are used in the various fluids are unknown to the public and to create a competitive edge. Last Monday four researchers from the University of New Brunswick released an editorial that sheds light on the potential risks that the current wastewater disposal system could have on the province's water resources. The researchers share the concern that Dr. Doss has and have come out to say that they believe fracking should be stopped in the province until there is an environ­mentally safe way to dispose the waste wastewater. ""If groundwater becomes contamin­ated, it takes years to decades to try to clean up an aquifer system,"" University of New Brunswick professor Tom Al said. While the USGS group which conducted the study says it is unclear how the earthquake rates may be related to oil and gas production, they've made the correlation between the disposal of wastewater used in fracking and the recent upsurge in earthquakes. Because of the recent information surfacing that shows this connection between the disposal process and earthquakes, individual states in the United States are now passing laws regarding disposal wells. 4=Dr. Paul K. Doss ""The problem is that we have never, as a human society, engineered a hole to go four miles down in the Earth’s crust that we have complete confidence that it won’t leak,"" Doss said. ""A perfect case-in-point is the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, that oil was being drilled at 18,000 feet but leaked at the surface. And that’s the concern because there’s no assurance that some of these unknown chemical cocktails won’t escape before it gets down to where they are trying to get rid of them."" It was said in the study released by the New Brunswick University professors that if fracking wastewater would contaminate groundwater, that current conventional water treatment would not be sufficient enough to remove the high concentration of chemicals used in fracking. The researchers did find that the wastewater could be recycled, can also be disposed of at proper sites or even pumped further underground into saline aquifers. The New Brunswick professors have come to the conclusion that current fracking methods used by companies, which use the water, should be replaced with carbon diox­ide or liquefied propane gas. ""You eliminate all the water-related issues that we’re raising, and that peo­ple have raised in general across North America,"" Al said. In New Brunswick liquefied propane gas has been used successfully in fracking some wells, but according to water specialist with the province’s Natural Resources De­partment Annie Daigle, it may not be the go-to solution for New Brunswick due its geological makeup. ""It has been used successfully by Corridor Resources here in New Bruns­wick for lower volume hydraulic frac­turing operations, but it is still a fairly new technology,"" Daigle said. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working with U.S. states to come up with guidelines to manage seismic risks due to wastewater. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA is the organization that also deals with the policies for wells. Oil wells, which are under regulation, pump out salt water known as brine, and after brine is pumped out of the ground it’s disposed of by being pumped back into the ground. The difference between pumping brine and the high pressurized fracking fluid back in the ground is the volume that it is disposed of. ""Brine has never caused this kind of earthquake activity,"" Doss said. ""The whole oil and gas industry has developed around the removal of natural gas by fracking techniques and has outpaced regulatory development. The regulation is tied to the ‘the run-of-the-mill’ disposal of waste, in other words the rush to produce this gas has occurred before regulatory agencies have had the opportunity to respond."" According to the USGS study, the increase in injecting wastewater into the ground may explain the sixfold increase of earthquakes in the central part of the United States from 2000 - 2011. USGS researchers also found that in decades prior to 2000 seismic events that happened in the midsection of the U.S. averaged 21 annually, in 2009 it spiked to 50 and in 2011 seismic events hit 134. ""The incredible volumes and intense disposal of fracking fluids in concentrated areas is what’s new,"" Doss said. ""There is not a body of regulation in place to manage the how these fluids are disposed of."" The study by the USGS was presented at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America on April 18, 2012."

tech,"NASA has stated that a three inch gouge has been found in the heat shield on one of Space Shuttle Endeavour's wings. The gouge was spotted as the shuttle approached the International Space Station (ISS) and captured on camera by ISS astronauts. According to NASA, the gouge was found on a six-inch thick tile on the starboard wing of the heat shield and that it may have been caused by ice and not foam. NASA is worried because the hole appears to be deep. ""What does this mean? I don’t know at this point. There are three prongs to our assessment, first we will conduct a thermal analysis based on the damage, check the flight history and test the area. We would never take it lightly to send astronauts to the underside of the vehicle to do anything,"" said the mission management team chairman, John Shannon who also said that until the damage is inspected, ""it's way too early to determine whether any repairs are required."" If the damage is found to be irreversible and cannot be fixed, the crew of Endeavour would stay on the ISS. NASA says that supplies would last until a rescue mission could be launched October 8 by sending up Discovery. During lift off of Endeavour on August 8, cameras had shown moisture which had gathered on the camera's lens, but NASA states that the object which caused the damage was not caught on camera. At least nine pieces of debris were reported to have been filmed while the shuttle took off, but NASA says that only three of those pieces of debris had a possibility of hitting the shuttle. Astronauts are expected to use a laser that is attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure the exact depth and size of the gouge on Sunday. The tile could be repaired by affixing a metal plate over the tile, filling it with putty, or sealing the gouge."
tech,"Atlanta-based CNN journalist Octavia Nasr, 20-year veteran of the network and senior editor for Middle East affairs, was reprimanded for a Twitter comment published on Sunday in which she expressed sadness at the death of Iraqi-born Lebanese Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah. In the post, the journalist stated that she was ""Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah.. One of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot.."". According to a New York Times blog, after Parisa Khosravi, the CNN senior vice president, ""had a conversation"" with Ms. Nasr she was formally asked to step down. She left the network on Wednesday. Brian Stelter of the Times reports that the issue was originally brought to the public's attention by online supporters of Israel, who republished the comment widely. They criticised her for being a ""Hezbollah sympathizer"" for a man who was ""committed to the destruction of Israel."" Critics point to comments Fadlallah has made in the past about the Holocaust, in which he questions the veracity of the agreed-upon figures of Jewish deaths in concentration camps. ""Is this the sort of extremist figure that CNN's Senior Editor of Mideast Affairs should be professing her respect for?"" asked HonestReporting, the media watchdog group which purports to defend Israel ""against prejudice in the media."" Salon reporter Glenn Greenwald has responded to these allegations of ""prejudice"" by pointing to similar cases in which no controversy arose: ""The Washington Post lavished editorial praise on the brutal, right-wing tyrant Augusto Pinochet, and that caused no controversy...Benjamin Netanyahu formally celebrates the Terrorist bombing of the King David Hotel that killed...78 civilians and nobody is stigmatized for supporting him. Erick Erickson sent around the most rancid and arguably racist tweets, only to thereafter be hired as a CNN contributor."" Lebanese author and academic Dr. As'ad Abu-Khalil has also argued that commentators have not properly placed Fadlallah in context, and pointed to the schools and orphanages he founded in Beirut and southern Lebanon. Amira Al Hussaini of Global Voices quotes Abu-Khalil's post, saying ""His Fadlallah's relationship with Hizbullah is always misunderstood...he broke from Wilayat Al-Faqih...and developed a new liberal thinking especially on issues of personal status laws."" He also ""urged for a closer relationship between science and religion"", which drew the ire of both Iran and Hizbullah. Nasr herself clarified her comment the day before her dismissal on a post to her CNN blog, saying that she used the words ""respect"" and ""sad"" because ""to me as a Middle Eastern woman, Fadlallah took a contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics on woman's rights. He called for the abolition of the tribal system of 'honor killing.' He called the practice primitive and non-productive. He warned Muslim men that abuse of women was against Islam."" The cleric has been a controversial figure in the West and has been blacklisted by the United States as a terrorist for several years, along with Hizbullah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. He is thought to have been the target of a 1985 car bombing in Beirut, which killed 80 people but not the Ayatollah himself. The BBC reports it may have been ""the work of the CIA, possibly in conjunction with regional intelligence agencies friendly to the US"", while David Kenner of Foreign Policy writes that the plot was all but confirmed by Bob Woodward through interviews with then-CIA Director William Casey."

On Friday, the same group allegedly brought down Scientology's main website, scientology.org, which was available sporadically throughout the weekend. Several websites relating to the Church of Scientology have been slowed down, brought to a complete halt or seemingly removed from the Internet completely in an attack which seems to be continuous. The scientology.org site was back online briefly on Monday, and is currently loading slowly. On Monday, the group released a video titled: ""Message to Scientology"" on YouTube concerning their intentions to attack the Church of Scientology. A robotic voice on the video begins with ""Hello leaders of Scientology. We are Anonymous,"" and continues by explaining their motivations: ""Over the years we have been watching you, your campaigns of misinformation, your suppression of dissent and your litigious nature. All of these things have caught our eye. With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us. Anonymous has therefore decided that your organisation should be destroyed."" The message goes on to state that the group intends to ""expel Scientology from the Internet"". As of Wednesday, the video had been viewed 370,347 times, favorited 2,473 times, and is currently YouTube's top third video of the day. 4=The Michigan Daily The ""Message to Scientology"" video was highlighted as the ""YouTube Video of the Week"" by The Michigan Daily. Commenting on the video, the piece states ""if this video is any indication, it seems like the assailants mean business"". In a blog post on USA Today's website, Jess Zielinski wrote that it was ""not a shock that hackers hold a grudge against Scientology,"" and in a followup post on another USA Today blog, Angela Gunn wrote that ""those of us who remember ... the adventures of Operation Clambake are fascinated to see this kind of thing flare up again"". Blogging for Wired magazine, Ryan Singel wrote about the incident in a piece on Wednesay titled ""War Breaks Out Between Hackers and Scientology -- There Can Be Only One"". Singel wrote that the Project Chanology wiki page ""directs Anonymous members to download and use denial of service software, make prank calls, host Scientology documents the Church considers proprietary, and fax endless loops of black pages to the Church's fax machines to waste ink"". According to Wired, ""The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to a call for comment"". The viewpoints expressed in the video are echoed on the ""Project Chanology"" website, an open source of information and direction for those within Anonymous, which talks of tactics such as blackfaxing and prank calling alongside other ""real-life"" methods of attack. The satirical website Encyclopedia Dramatica also has a similar page devoted to ""Project Chanology"". 4=""Anonymous"" - Press Release ""Anonymous"" released a statement on Monday in the form of a press release, ""Internet Group Anonymous Declares ""War on Scientology"": ""Anonymous"" are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center"". In the statement, the group explained their goal as safeguarding the right to freedom of speech ""A spokesperson said that the group's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech, a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents."" The press release also claimed that the Church of Scientology misused copyright and trademark law in order to remove criticism from websites including Digg and YouTube. The statement goes on to assert that the attacks from the group ""will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts, at which point they will change strategy"". The attack was reportedly motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube. After the Church of Scientology lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube, the site took down the video. The Tom Cruise video is still available on Gawker.com, which has stated it will not remove the video ""It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it."" 4=Gawker.com Gawker.com discussed the actions of the ""Anonymous"" group, in a post on Monday titled ""Scientology vs. the Internet: Why Kids On The Internet Are Scientology's Most Powerful Enemy"". Gawker.com briefly outlined actions of other anonymous users critical of Scientology, including actions taken in the past by users of YouTube, Digg, and YTMND ""This isn't the only group of Internet users unafraid of the intimidating cult; a whole range of sites has turned the Church into a mockery by doing what mainstream celebrity-coverage outlets wouldn't dare."" A poster on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology (a.r.s.) was critical of the actions by the ""Anonymous"" group. In a post titled ""Open Letter to Anonymous"" Jeff Jacobsen, webmaster of lisamcpherson.org, posting as ""cultxpt"" wrote that ""It's understandable that people get upset over the things the Church of Scientology has done online and off"", pointing out that the Church of Scientology had ""tried to shut down a.r.s."", and ""spam our newsgroup to this day"". In 1999 ""sporgery"", a form of nonsensical spam tactic, was used as an attempt to disrupt discussion on the newsgroup. Previously in 1995 Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the Church of Scientology, attempted to remove the a.r.s. group from Usenet. Kobrin sent a rmgroup message which stated: ""We have requested that the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup be removed from all sites"". This later led to a declaration of war by the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, and an increase in popularity of the a.r.s site. This initial conflict came to be known as ""Scientology versus the Internet"". The post from Jacobsen went on to criticize the actions of the ""Anonymous"" group, stating: ""We're supposed to be the good people,"" and stated that contrary to the Anonymous group's tactics, ""Our weapons as critics are reason, evidence, argument, and free speech"". 4=Andreas Heldal-Lund, Operation Clambake On Tuesday, the founder of Operation Clambake, a non-profit organization and website critical of Scientology based in Stavanger, Norway, released a statement about the attacks by ""Anonymous"". Andreas Heldal-Lund was critical of the ""Anonymous"" groups actions, stating: ""The author of Operation Clambake does not condone such activity. Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card. They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy."" Heldal-Lund went on to emphasize the right of all people and organizations to freedom of speech - including the Church of Scientology: ""Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion."""
tech,"SpaceNASA announced during a press conference on Friday night that the agency has decided to delay the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery, which was scheduled for takeoff on February 27. NASA cited the need for additional time to evaluate the shuttle's hydrogen fuel flow control valves. A new launch date has yet to be scheduled, though NASA is considering mid-March as an option. Another review of Discovery's flight readiness is scheduled for February 25. Discovery had originally been scheduled for liftoff on February 12, but NASA wanted to perform additional tests on the valves which control the amount of hydrogen fuel pumped into the external tank when the shuttle is taking off. When Space Shuttle Endeavour went into space in November 2008, one of the valves broke. NASA fears that if one breaks off on this mission, then it could damage the outside of the shuttle. ""We need to complete more work to have a better understanding before flying,"" said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Space Operations at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. who chaired Friday's Flight Readiness Review. ""We were not driven by schedule pressure and did the right thing. When we fly, we want to do so with full confidence."" The current scheduled mission, STS-119, is set to fly the Integrated Truss Structure segment (""S"" for starboard, the right side of the station, and ""6"" for its place at the very end of the starboard truss) and install the final set of power-generating solar arrays to the International Space Station. The arrays consist of two 115-foot-long arrays, for a total wing span of 240 feet, including the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to twist as they track the sun. Altogether, the four sets of arrays can generate 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity – enough to provide power for more than 40 average homes. Commander Lee Archambault will lead Discovery's crew of seven, along with Pilot Tony Antonelli, and Mission Specialists Joseph Acaba, John Phillips, Steve Swanson, Richard Arnold, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata."
tech,"internetEgyptian Communication and Information Technology Minister Tarek Kamel announced on Sunday that the country had filed an application for the "".misr"" ("".Egypt"") top-level domain (مصر‎ in Arabic) and that registrations for second-level domains would begin as of midnight (2200 UTC) at an Internet conference sponsored by the United Nations. According to Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) chief executive Rod Beckstrom, six countries have applied for top-level domains in three languages since the Internet coordinator opened up the use of non Latin scripts yesterday. ""Now we can really say that Internet will speak Arabic,"" said Kamel at the start of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)'s fourth conference at Sharm el-Sheikh. The expansion of Internet domain names with Internationalized Domain Names (IDN), containing non-Latin characters is the fruit of six years of discussions and technical work, resulting in the ICANN voting on October 30 to allow the new domain names. It has been called the move the ""biggest change"" to the Internet ""since it was invented 40 years ago"". ""Over half the Internet users around the world don't use a Latin-based script as their native language,"" commented Rod Beckstrom, president of the ICANN. ""IDNs are about making the Internet more global and accessible for everyone."" source=Tarek KamelThe IGF conference will address access to the Internet, notably local content reflecting different cultures and languages. Other key topics are cybercrime and safe Internet usage. The theme of the conference is ""Creating Opportunities for All"", reflected in a speech by the United Nations Undersecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Sha Zukang. ""The voice of developing world must be heard,"" he said. ICANN, a non-profit, private organisation, currently limits the application for new domains to national governments or territories, although domain names will be available to individuals at a later date via national registries."
tech,"The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced Friday that its vote in May last year was not to reject the creation of 'Triple X', a top-level domain (sTLD). Rather, the corporation voted ""not to approve the agreement as proposed, but did not reject the application"". A revised proposal for the .xxx domain is open to public comment until February 5. The revised proposal appears to have hinged on efforts by ICM, proponents of a voluntary adult top-level domain, to promote enforcement in the following areas: #Prohibit child pornography #Require clear labeling #Support development of user empowerment technology #Ensure that the child advocacy and free expression communities are involved in policy development for the sTLD. Who, or what, ICM is remains unclear. The home page of ICM states that, ""The .xxx top-level domain will create a clearly identifiable area of the Internet so that Internet users can be more informed when choosing to select or avoid adult entertainment sites."" The estimated $12 billion per year in revenues generated by on-line pornography could come under the scrutiny of unknown ICM, to whom ICANN proposes delegating responsibility to an organization, or individual, that has nothing more to say about themselves on their website than the background of their leaders."
tech,"Space At 11:29 AM EDT today, the Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on the final mission in NASA's Space Shuttle program, STS-135. The mission is slated to last 12 days and will deliver parts and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), including the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and an experiment, the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM), designed to test methods, tools, and technologies required to robotically refuel satellites in space, even those not designed to be serviced. The launch occurred despite weather concerns at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States. Although there was a short two and a half minute hold in the countdown at T-31 seconds while engineers worked out a small glitch, the launch was flawless. Eight and a half minutes after lifting off for the final time, Atlantis reached its preliminary orbit, travelling over 17,000 miles per hour several hundreds of miles above the Earth. The crew of STS-135 consists of only four astronauts, the smallest shuttle crew since STS-6 in 1983: Commander Christopher Ferguson, Pilot Douglas Hurley, and Mission Specialists Sandra Magnus and Rex Walheim. STS-135 is the third spaceflight for Ferguson, Magnus, and Walheim, and the second for Hurley. Futhermore, an iPhone will be the first one to ever be brought into space aboard the flight with an application developed for the Apple smartphone, called SpaceLab for iOS, that is meant to help the astronauts track their scientific results and perhaps one day aid in navigation. The device will be housed inside a small research platform built by the company NanoRacks. The platform will be placed inside the ISS. Along with the iPhone, a flag from the first shuttle mission, STS-1, will be brought along on the flight and left aboard the orbital outpost until the first commercial spaceflight to the station, when NASA astronauts will retrieve it. An estimated 750,000 people crowded the launch site as Atlantis flexed ""its muscles one final time"", in the words of NASA ascent commentator Rob Navias. The first mission of the Space Shuttle program, STS-1, launched on April 12, 1981. Since then, 135 missions over 30 years have been launched. Out of these flights, two involved catastrophic failures, STS-51-L Challenger in January 1986 and STS-107 Columbia in February 2003, both killing all on board. During the entire shuttle program, 355 people from 16 countries have flown 852 times aboard the Space Shuttle. The five shuttle orbiters have flown 537114016. During her career spanning over 26 years, Atlantis flew on 33 flights, including the first shuttle docking to the Russian Mir space station on STS-71 in June 1995, the first launch with a camera mounted on the exterior of the external fuel tank on STS-112 in October 2002, and the final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope on STS-125 in May 2009. The final Space Shuttle launch marks the end of an era for NASA and the United States amid uncertainty about the American space program's and NASA's future. Before the launch, mission commander Christopher Ferguson made a statement conveying his thoughts about the program's end: ""The shuttle is always going to be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through. We're not ending the journey today ... we're completing a chapter of a journey that will never end."""
tech,"Soyuz TMA-12M, a Russian spacecraft carrying a crew of three, arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) at 2353 UTC yesterday, after a technical setback prevented a planned rendezvous and docking on Tuesday. The spacecraft, which launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2117 UTC on Tuesday (3:17 AM, Wednesday local time), was originally scheduled to dock with the space station at 0304 UTC on Wednesday. It was not in the proper orientation to execute one of the engine burns required as part of the expedited rendezvous procedure used since last year, however, and docking with the ISS was delayed until yesterday. The mission reverted to the flight plan used on Soyuz flights to the ISS previously: a longer, two-day, 34-orbit rendezvous. The precise cause of the malfunction has not yet been publicly announced, but NASA said Wednesday, all systems aboard the Soyuz appeared to be functioning normally despite the setback which prevented a docking approximately six hours after launch. Also according to NASA, engineers understand the issue and have developed methods to prevent a recurrence on a future flight and the crew was never in any danger. Soyuz TMA-12M successfully docked with the station wiki=yes above Brazil at 2353 UTC yesterday, with hatch opening between the two spacecraft occurring at 0235 UTC today. On board the Soyuz were two Russian cosmonauts: Commander Aleksandr Skvortsov and Flight Engineer Oleg Artemyev, as well as one NASA astronaut: Flight Engineer Steven Swanson. TMA-12M is a return to space for both Skvortsov and Swanson, who are making the trip for the second and third times, respectively. Artemyev is visiting space for the first time. Filling out the full six person contingent on the station, they join three Expedition 39 crew members aboard the ISS: Japanese astronaut and station commander Koichi Wakata, NASA astronaut Richard Mastracchio and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They launched aboard Soyuz TMA-11M in November of last year and were the sole inhabitants of the station since the departure of Soyuz TMA-10M on March 11. Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson are to become the crew of Expedition 40 when TMA-11M is scheduled to depart in May with Wakata, Mastracchio and Tyurin aboard, at which time Swanson is to assume command of the station. The trio are slated to remain aboard the orbital outpost for approximately six months, until TMA-12M undocks in mid-September and returns to Earth."

Since the discovery of asteroid 2007 WD5 on November 20, 2007, scientists at NASA's Near-Earth object Office have been tracking it, and say that the asteroid could come within 48,000 kilometers of the planet around January 30, 2008. ""Right now asteroid 2007 WD5 is about half-way between Earth and Mars and closing the distance at a speed of about 27,900 miles per hour. Over the next five weeks, we hope to gather more information from observatories so we can further refine the asteroid's trajectory,"" said Don Yeomans, manager of the Near Earth Object Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It may also hit near the area where the Opportunity Rover is currently exploring, but scientists say that the rover is outside of the zone of possible impact. The current odds of the asteroid hitting the planet are 1 in a 75 chance that it will make its impact on or around that date. ""These odds are extremely unusual. We frequently work with really long odds when we track...threatening asteroids. We know that it's going to fly by Mars and most likely going to miss, but there's a possibility of an impact,"" said Steve Chesley, an astronomer with the Near Earth Object Office."
tech,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida - The first new heavy lift space vehicle in a generation is cleared to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Boeing Delta IV Heavy has missed launch opportunities three days in a row (starting Friday, December 12) due to minor technical difficulties. It is now scheduled to launch Dec. 20 or 21 from pad SLC-37B. The Delta 4 was developed as part of the U.S Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program to reduce costs and improve reliability. The basic design is a two stage, cryogenic LOx/LH2 rocket. Strap-on boosters may be added to increase lift capacity. Two major obstacles have plagued the project in recent years; a bidding scandal which cost Boeing a large portion of the military satellite launch business for which it was competing, and a downturn in commercial satellite launches in 2001. The Heavy variant of the Delta 4 rocket can place 13,100 kg (28,950 Lb) into geostationary transfer orbit, greater than any other current rocket. Two additional first stage cores are used as strap-on boosters for this configuration. Their rated thrust is 2,900,000 N (656,000 lb) each. Delta 4's main engine, the RS68, is the most powerful hydrogen/liquid oxygen engine in the world, approximately three times as powerful as the Ariane 5 Vulcain HM60. Its design sacrifices efficiency for increased reliability and lower cost: rated specific impulse is 365s at sea level and 410s in a vacuum. The second stage engine, Pratt and Whitney's RL-10B-2, has a specific impulse of 462s. The primary market for this launcher will be classified spy satellites for the US intelligence community. Most of these satellites were previously launched on the Titan 4, which has since been retired. The Delta 4 Heavy's published launch cost is $170 million, compared to the Titan 4's $400 million (1999 dollars). Delta 4 Heavy's maiden launch is a demonstration and will carry a dummy load and two nano-satellites. The main payload, dubbed DemoSat is a 6020 kg (13271 lb) mass designed to simulate the dynamic and initial properties of a real satellite. Its design consists of large brass rods, intended to fully burn up on reentry. The two nano-satellites are part of the US Department of Defense Nanosat-2 Program, and built by students from New Mexico State University, Arizona State University, and the University of Colorado at Boulder."

When users click an email attachment, their PCs become infected with destructive, self-replicating software. The worm affects Microsoft Windows operating systems and is programmed to go to work on the third of every month, overwriting or corrupting Microsoft files and others such as Portable Document Format (PDF) files. ""This one can damage your office files, your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and your PowerPoint presentations,"" Tino Klironomos, a computer retailer, said. ""(The files will be) all gone, history."" Computer security company LURHQ reports that there may be hundreds of thousands of machines already infected with the worm, which also goes by the monikers ""BlackWorm,"" ""CME-24,"" ""Blackmal,"" ""Mywife.E"" and ""Nyxem."" To prevent the worm, Windows users should arm themselves with anti-virus software. People can also protect their PC with up-to-date anti-virus gear and firewall protection. Free anti-virus tools are available from many anti-virus organisations. These tools can detect and remove the Kama Sutra worm from an infected machine. Experts say: ""Make sure your virus definitions are up to date. Besides being careful about opening email messages and attachments, users should back up their most valuable computer files on an external device such as a CD, zip drive or DVD."" Steve Bass at PC World says: ""Stop worrying. If you update your virus program signatures regularly, and do a weekly AV scan, I don't think you have much to worry about..."" Other advice is not to open any messages with the subject headers ""crazy, illegal sex"", ""give me a kiss"" and ""hot movie."" The worm will not affect machines running on non-Windows operating systems such as Mac OS X or GNU/Linux. Many security systems reported a very small amount of vandalism, even though the threats were very high."

tech,"Scientists at NASA say that new satellite images of Saturn's moon Enceladus taken in 2005, has shown that the moon has begun to spew geysers which contain liquid water, and that the internal heat produced by the moon's core may be able to host life below the icy surface, but scientists also stress that life has not yet been found on the moon. Scientists say that the heat source producing the geysers is ""organic"" and that the material used to spew them is caused by the decaying of radioactive material from inside the moon. ""Deep inside Enceladus, our model indicates we've got an organic brew, a heat source and liquid water, all key ingredients for life. And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life,"" said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the Cassini project. In a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by aluminum and iron isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space. ""Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock. The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core. The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species,"" said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the Jet Propulsion laboratory or JPL. ""The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat. This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug,"" said a statement on NASA""s website. Data from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus. The results show that carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane, propane and nitrogen, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon. ""The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup,"" added the statement. Cassini will make a flyby on Enceladus in march of 2008. The mission will ""measure the gas emanating from the plume,"" ended the statement."

It is the first rocky planet to be discovered orbiting a star, although three other rocky planets have in the past been discovered in orbit around a pulsar. There are two other gaseous, Jupiter-like planets in orbit around the same star. ""This is the smallest extrasolar planet yet detected and the first of a new class of rocky terrestrial planets,"" said Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution, one of the teams that discovered the new planet. ""It's like Earth's bigger cousin."" The newly discovered world has about 7½ times the mass of Earth. Its orbital period, or ""year"", is a mere 2 days in length and its path takes it 10 times closer to its star than the closest planet is to our Sun. The temperature on the surface is estimated between 400 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 400 degrees Celsius), and is too hot for life forms that are similar to those found on Earth. ""A planet seven and a half times the mass of the Earth could easily hold onto an atmosphere,"" explained Gregory Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of California in Santa Cruz. ""It would still be considered a rocky planet, probably with an iron core and a silicate mantle. It could even have a dense steamy water layer. I think what we are seeing here is something that's intermediate between a true terrestrial planet like the Earth and a hot version of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.""

One study carried out by the news department of the scientific journal Nature, a study of 42 selected science articles showed that Wikipedia had 162 errors, whilst the Encyclopædia Britannica had 123. The Encyclopædia Britannica responded by saying that the study was misleading because certain articles were not taken from the Encyclopædia, some articles were combinations of several articles, others were simply excerpts.

Only fifteen planetary systems are known to contain more than three planets. The newly discovered system is centered around star HD 10180, whose properties may be similar to those of our own Sun. The researchers who made the discovery say that the system is arranged in a more compact way than our own; it is believed that the year of one of the inner planets could be equal to as little as just over one Earth day. It is believed that up to seven planets may be present in this system; two, however, are subject to ambiguity. One of these is believed to have a mass that may be relatively close to Earth's. This planet, if confirmed, may prove to be the smallest world yet discovered outside our solar system. This system, however, is not the first to be discovered outside our solar system. Astronomers have been spotting these systems for several years. Christophe Lovis, lead researcher on the project, shares his thoughts about the discovery: ""This also highlights the fact that we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research - the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets."" Martin Dominik, an astronomer from the University of St. Andrews, warns against describing the system as the ""richest yet discovered,"" as it is unclear whether other systems with more planets have been discovered in the past. Dominik elaborates: ""Like most discoveries in science, the findings come with more questions than answers; but in my opinion, this is what really advances a field."""

""We want to fly a good mission, we want to fly a safe mission, we want to have a successful mission,"" said Space Shuttle Program Manager, Wayne Hale. ""We put together a huge amount of data, but it's not complete yet. We have to put all the data on the table and look at it,"" said deputy manager of the Orbiter Project, Ed Mango. He also stated that ""we'll need more time to understand what this signature really means."" The issue has never before been seen on the space shuttles. The issue with the fuel cell was discovered by officials when NASA was preparing to fill up Atlantis's fuel tank. One cell gave a low voltage reading, while two other cells gave readings that were too high. All three of the fuel cells must be working properly in order for Atlantis to lift-off successfully. More tests will be done on Atlantis in the next 24-hours, but so far officials have not yet decided when Atlantis will launch. The next window for launching is on Friday September 8, 2006 at 11:41 a.m.. If Atlantis does not launch on Friday, officials will try for a launch date in October. A meeting was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. this afternoon between NASA officials, but there is no word on the conclusion of that meeting."
tech,"The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has successfully launched another of their H-IIA space rockets. Its payload, the MTSAT-2 satellite designed to control air traffic and track weather patterns, has successfully separated from the rocket. It is due to be inserted into a geostationary orbit on the 21st of February. The satellite is owned by the Civil Aviation Bureau and the Japan Meteorological Agency, part of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The rocket was launched from the Tanegashima space centre in the southern region of Kagoshima, at 15:55 (06:55 GMT). It is the ninth in a series of H-IIA rockets, which form the main part of the Japanese space program. A previous H-IIA rocket was launched less than a month ago."
tech,"Space Reaction Engines Limited, a firm in Oxford, United Kingdom, has recently been awarded €1 million by the European Space Agency. This money is to be used for development work for the firm's SABRE engines. The SABRE engines are for a reusable spaceplane that it is intended to be able to travel into space and return completely intact. Reaction Engines Limited says the Skylon plane could be in service within 10 years. When in service it would be intended to be regularly carrying up to 60 passengers into orbit much more cheaply than today. The cash will be used to test a precooled jet engine that would cool the very hot air entering the engines and should permit the aircraft to fly more economically, like a jet plane. The plane will fly through the air to 26 km (85,000 feet) altitude and five times the speed of sound before using rockets to push the aircraft the rest of the way to orbit. The BBC says that other aspects of the Skylon design will be investigated by EADS Astrium, the German space agency (DLR) and the University of Bristol."

tech,"Calmos Ali Akbar Salehi, chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, announced Friday that Iran is scheduled to launch its first nuclear power plant in Bushehr. Russia said that it will start loading fuel into the reactor on August 21, 2010. Russia has assisted Iran in the construction of this reactor since the mid-1990s. The proposal to build this reactor was put forth 35 years ago by Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, the former emperor of Iran. Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev, the current president of Russia, said that Iran and Russia are in active trade partnership. Medvedev called on Iran last month to explain its nuclear program. The official launch is scheduled for August 21, 2010. Russia has promised to run the plant by supplying fuel and taking away fuel waste."
tech,"ScientologyThe Internet-based group ""Anonymous"" released a new video on YouTube Monday, announcing international protests outside Church of Scientology centers set for February 10. The video ""Call to Action"" uses the same computer synthesized voice as a previous video titled ""Message to Scientology"", which was posted to YouTube last Monday. The ""Message to Scientology"" video has been viewed over 1,400,000 times, and the ""Call to Action"" video has already been viewed over 237,000 times. Anonymous is taking action against the Church of Scientology in response to what it sees as suppression of freedom of speech on the Internet. The group was first motivated after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright infringement claim to YouTube regarding a promotional video of Scientologist Tom Cruise speaking about his beliefs and using Scientology jargon. The Church of Scientology also issued a legal complaint to the website Gawker.com which is also hosting the video, but Gawker has stated it will not take the video down because it is newsworthy. Anonymous set up a movement called ""Project Chanology"" to coordinate their efforts, and took down several Church of Scientology websites through denial-of-service attacks. Members of Anonymous have also participated in prank calls to Church of Scientology centers, as well as protests or ""raids"" outside Scientology buildings, and have posted some of their exploits to YouTube. 4=Anonymous, ""Call to Action"". In the ""Call to Action"" video, Anonymous denies that they are composed solely of ""super hackers"", stating ""Anonymous is a collective of individuals united by an awareness that someone must do the right thing, that someone must bring light to the darkness, that someone must open the eyes of a public that has slumbered for far too long."" The video goes on to state ""We want you to be aware of the very real dangers of Scientology,"" citing what they term ""gross human rights violations"". Specific controversial events in Scientology history are cited in the video, including Operation Freakout and Paulette Cooper, and Operation Snow White. Operation Freakout was the name of a Church of Scientology operation whose goal was to ""get P.C. Paulette Cooper incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks."" Paulette Cooper had written a book critical of Scientology called The Scandal of Scientology. Operation Snow White was the name of a Church of Scientology operation where members of the Church's secretive Guardian's Office infiltrated United States government agencies in Washington, D.C. including the I.R.S. The F.B.I.'s investigation into Operation Snow White led them to discover the planning of actions taken against Paulette Cooper. The video concludes by inviting the viewer to ""take up the banner of free speech"" and protest with Anonymous world wide. In an email to CNET News, Anonymous stated that cities where unknown activities are planned on February 10 include New York City, Montreal, Houston, London, Melbourne, and Los Angeles. On Friday, two spokespersons for the Church of Scientology commented on the recent actions of Anonymous. A spokesman told News.com.au ""These types of people have got some wrong information about us,"" and Church spokeswoman Yvette Shank told Sun Media that she regarded members of Anonymous as a ""pathetic"" group of ""computer geeks"". On Monday, Radar reported that the Church of Scientology has asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the F.B.I., and the LAPD to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the Internet attacks. A source told Radar that the Church of Scientology is arguing that the Internet attacks are a form of ""illegal interference with business."" Radar also reports that the Church of Scientology is emphasizing its status as a religious organization in the United States, in order to assert that the Internet attacks can be classed as hate crimes. 4=Mark Bunker, XenuTV.com. On Saturday, Mark Bunker of the website XenuTV.com posted a video to YouTube criticizing the illegal actions of Anonymous and suggested legal methods for them to retaliate against the Church of Scientology, including peaceful protesting, writing letters to their government representatives, and persuading the United States government to take away the Church of Scientology's tax exempt status. In the video, Bunker states ""I'm mainly concerned because you shouldn't be doing things that are illegal, you just shouldn't. It's not morally right, and it's not right when Scientology does it, it's not right when we do it."" Bunker's video post has been viewed over 156,000 times. On Sunday, Bunker posted a follow-up video to YouTube where he gives advice to Anonymous on how to peacefully picket. He also provides viewers with resources and weblinks to more information on how to hold a peaceful protest. He concludes this video by imitating Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi mind trick technique and voice from Star Wars, stating ""And if I may, as Obi-Wan, tell you: You will do nothing illegal "".

tech,"On March 31, 2006 the AMSAT-DL/IUZ team in Bochum, Germany managed to receive a signal by the American space probe Voyager 1 using the 20m antenna. It is the first time that a group of radio amateurs has successfully attempted this. The team included: Freddy de Guchteneire, James Miller, Hartmut Päsler and Achim Vollhardt. Voyager 1 had been launched on September 5, 1977 by NASA and was the first spacecraft to transmit close-up pictures of Jupiter and Saturn. In 2004 Voyager 1 entered the termination shock region, the region where the solar wind has weakened enough to mix with the interstellar medium, thereby leaving the Solar System. Voyager 1 is now 98 AU from Earth (14.7 billion km or three times the distance from Earth to Pluto). It is the most distant human-made object. The nuclear powered probe continues to measure the properties of the interstellar magnetic field."
tech,"U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ruled Friday to grant a request for a permanent injunction against Vonage for violating patented intellectual property rights of Verizon. The injunction would not take effect until after a hearing scheduled for April 6. The court will rule on whether the request by Vonage to stay the decision has sufficient merit during the time it would take for the largest U.S. VoIP provider to appeal the March 8 jury finding that the company violated what it maintains are Verizon innovations too broadly defined to be patentable. ""Despite this obvious attempt by Verizon to cripple Vonage, the litigation will not stop Vonage from continuing to provide quality VoIP service to our millions of customers,"" said Mike Snyder, the Vonage chief executive officer. The March 8 jury findings dismissed Vonage of wrong-doing on 4 of Verizon's 7 claims that Vonage infringed on its patent rights. Verizon noted as part of its complaint against Vonage that, ""Vonage's expanded marketing and advertising of its infringing services threaten to shift more customers and goodwill to its business at Verizon's expense,"" according to Olga Kharif of CIO Today. Vonage says it did not know it was infringing on patents rights of the 3 Verizon claims that held up in court. The effect of an injunction on the 2.2 million Vonage customers using the services would mean: #an inability to place Internet calls to traditional phone line services #the elimination of voice mail and call waiting #the lack of wireless to Internet phone calls"
tech,"NASA has announced plans for sending humans back to the Moon, as a first step to Mars. A 2018 lunar mission is proposed, where a crew of four would remain on the Moon for as long as a week. A minimum of two lunar missions a year is planned, with astronauts remaining as long as six months. Some of the technology had previously been proposed for replacement of the Space Shuttle. * Astronauts will be launched in a capsule, similar in concept to that used for the Project Apollo but three times larger. The top part of an Exploration Transportation System (ETS), the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will be a capsule attached to a service module which contains supplies, power, and propulsion units. The CEV is designed for use in Earth orbit. * On lunar missions, crew or cargo versions of a Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) would be used with a CEV. The LSAM will have design concepts related to the Apollo Lunar Module, with a four-legged landing unit carrying an ascent stage. * An Earth Departure Stage (EDS), a powerful propulsion unit, will be used to move CEV and LSAM units out of Earth orbit, such as on lunar missions. * Heavy Launcher unmanned cargo rockets will be used for heavy loads of equipment. * The launch rockets, Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicles, will use engines developed for the Shuttle program. ** CEV will be launched atop a Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), a single solid fuel booster with a second stage using a shuttle main engine. The CLV can carry a payload of 25 metric tons into low Earth orbit. ** The heavy-lift system uses a pair of longer solid rocket boosters and five shuttle main engines to put up to 125 metric tons in orbit -- about one and a half times the weight of a shuttle orbiter. * The use of a Launch Escape System (LES) will improve safety. A LES is a top-mounted rocket that can quickly remove the crew capsule away from an exploding or otherwise dangerous rocket. For a lunar mission, the LSAM and EDS would be placed in orbit by a cargo launcher, then a CEV would dock with the assembly before leaving Earth orbit. The goal is to begin production of the new spacecraft by 2011. * Robotic missions will be sent, probably the first one in 2008. * Past experience with lunar dust is being used in designing equipment and spacesuits which may encounter it. * Surface mobility with open and pressurized rovers for use in such missions is also being developed. * The CEV can be reused up to ten times. * Crew capsule, upon return to Earth, will set down on dry land. It can also land on water. * The CEV and lunar lander ascent stage use methane as fuel, as methane may be available on Mars. * Eventually the designs could be expanded to support six astronauts for a trip to Mars. The plans are a means to implement President Bush's ""Vision for Space Exploration"" program. Goals include: * Implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond; * Extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations; * Develop the innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures both to explore and to support decisions about the destinations for human exploration; and * Promote international and commercial participation in exploration to further U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests."
tech,"NASA's Cassini spacecraft has discovered evidence that points to the existence of an underground ocean of water and ammonia on Saturn's moon Titan. ""We believe that about 100 kilometers (62 miles) beneath the ice and organic-rich surface is an internal ocean of liquid water mixed with ammonia,"" said Bryan Stiles of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. If the findings turn out to be true, this will be the fourth such moon in our solar system found to have some form of water on it. Currently only three other moons, all from Jupiter, have been found to have known water sources. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa are so far the only known moons with a water source. Members of the mission's science team used Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar to collect imaging data during 19 separate passes over Titan between October 2005 and May 2007. The radar can see through Titan's dense, methane-rich atmospheric haze, detailing never-before-seen surface features and establishing their locations on the moon's surface. Using data from the radar's early observations, the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan's surface. They then searched for these same lakes, canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan. They found prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 30 kilometers (19 miles). A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean, making it easier for the crust to move. Cassini scientists will not have long to wait before another go at Titan. On March 25, just prior to its closest approach at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Cassini will employ its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer to examine Titan's upper atmosphere. Immediately after closest approach, the spacecraft's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer will capture high-resolution images of Titan's southeast quadrant. The study of Titan is a major goal of the Cassini-Huygens mission because it may preserve, in deep-freeze, many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on Earth. Titan is the only moon in the solar system that possesses a dense atmosphere. The moon's atmosphere is 1.5 times denser than Earth's. Titan is the largest of Saturn's moons, bigger than the planet Mercury."
tech,"Following the introduction of a ""Do Not Track"" feature in modern browsers at the end of last year, Wikinews interviewed several companies and groups about the feature. A crowdsourced search engine DuckDuckGo reviewed the feature and launched a whatisDNT microsite in December. The review involved checking answers to basic questions such as whether websites stop shaping a user profile based on users' online actvitity or stop displaying targeted advertising. Wikinews interviewed DuckDuckGo founder Gabriel Weinberg about the microsite launch and the DuckDuckGo opinion on the feature. Wikinews What prompted the launch of DuckDuckGo (I think it was around 2006?)? ::Gabriel Weinberg: We launched on Sep 25, 2008, though I had been working on it for about a year prior. The initial motivation was to try a search engine with a different UI that did a better job of using more structured content (like from Wikipedia) and also more aggressively removed spam. Wikinews What does the DuckDuckGo Team use instead of Gmail? ::GW: We do not have company mail accounts (beyond forwarding ones), so everyone uses what they want. I personally use outlook.com right now. Wikinews When and how did DuckDuckGo start using Perl? What influenced this decision and language choice? ::GW: We started out in Perl. I picked it up at MIT where it was prevalent in the late 90s, and pretty much never looked back. It worked really well for a project like this that is text heavy and can use a lot of existing helper (CPAN) libraries. Wikinews How did you first hear about ""DoNotTrack"" feature? ::GW: I do not remember, but it was a long time ago :). The Do Not Track concept was proposed many years ago. Wikinews When did you launch http://whatisDNT.com/&amp;nbsp;? Who worked on it? What researches, tests and studies did it involve? ::GW: We launched the What Is Do Not Track micro-site on Dec 19, 2012, and various members of the DuckDuckGo Team worked on it (including myself). We had been following it closely for a while, and so have been up to date on everything that is going on with it. It honestly doesn't take any tests to prove its ineffectiveness since companies like Google tell you straight up they don't honor it. Wikinews A search engine that does not track users sounds good. What do you recommend users to do to not be tracked by *other* websites, such as blogs with targeted ads in sidebar? ::GW: It depends on the Web browser you are using for specifics, but for each major Web browser there are tools you can install (besides DuckDuckGo extensions) to protect you in various scenarios. Some of those that are available in multiple browsers are Ghostery, DoNotTrackMe, and HTTPS Everywhere. Those help protect you while not really changing your browsing experience. Other tools do more, but do impact your browsing experience, like Tor and NoScript. Wikinews What is your opinion of ad block tools such as AdBlockPlus and NoScript that ideally aim to block third-party js? ::GW: I think they are effective at doing what they set out to do, and that is great if you are a consumer who wants that experience. However, they are not for everyone because they do degrade browsing ability, especially NoScript. Wikinews Do you think that DoNotTarget option should exist (if consistendly adhered to)? ::GW: Absolutely. My main problem with the DoNotTrack setting right now is it is misleading. If you use a major Web browser, you have this Do Not Track setting within it, but it really does next to nothing. It is a false sense of security. Wikinews What do you see the ideal behaviour of companies when it comes to making a user's profile? Would you like to ideally prohibit such activity entirely using legislative regulations in the long run? ::GW: Yes, I think an analogy to the Do Not Call list is apt. Applying that analogy, if you were on a Do Not Track list then companies shouldn't track you unless you explicitly ask them to, e.g. by logging in and consenting to Terms of Service. That will only happen via legislative means, however. Wikinews also interviewed Haakon Flage Bratsberg, Product Counsel from Opera Software, the corporation behind Opera web browser. Wikinews Have you heard of ""Do Not Track"" feature support in modern browsers? What do you think about it? ::Haakon Flage Bratsberg: Opera browser for desktop computers has built in support for Do Not Track since version 12, and Opera Software participates in the W3C Tracking Protection Working Group. Wikinews Given that not all companies respect this setting, do you feel its name misleading? Do you think it could better be named ""Do Not Target"" instead? ::HFB: This is our major concern about the DNT functionality: Users can be given a false sense of security. Wikinews Do you think that all websites should respect DNT users' preferences in the long run? ::HFB: In general we think websites should comply with web standards, including the current proposal for DNT. Wikinews Would you ideally see the respect for DNT users' preferences legally enforced? ::HFB: There are obvious limitations to a pure self regulatory approach, but our hope is that self regulation will provide a sufficient good outcome in this case. Wikinews What do you see as an ideal solution to resolve the misleading situation with DoNotTrack that you acknowledged in your response to the second question? ::HFB: First of all, I personally do not think the name of DoNotTrack is misleading. However, the challenge is to have a meaningful standard that users can still be aware of the risks of that may be involved without giving a false sense of security. For example ""private mode"" in your browser does not prevent that your internet access provider can still keep track of what websites you visit, websites can collect information about you and so on. It only removes the trace of the sites you visited in your ""browser"". Similarly, the websites can by accident or intention to be set up in a way so they do not comply with the DNT signal. There is always a risk of rouge agents. Wikinews How do you envision the ""self regulatory"" approach? How would it work? ::HFB: Self regulation basically means that the different stakeholders without having a legal obligation to do so, comply with a set of rules, for example an industry technical specification as W3C tracking protection standards. My take is that DNT would be a success if all major stakeholders involved in the process would comply with the standards. It is more an open question to what extent compliance to the technical standard is sufficient to comply with applicable laws in its respective country, for instance, in EU, or in the USA. Wikinews contacted the Mozilla press office and got replies on behalf of the Mozilla Corporation. Wikinews When and why did you decide to start supporting the Do Not Track feature? ::Mozilla: Mozilla introduced Do Not Track in the desktop Firefox browser in January 2011, and in June 2011 Firefox for Android became the first mobile browser to support Do Not Track. ::M: We support Do Not Track because we believe it is crucial to put users in control of their online experience. Do Not Track is intended to give users choice and control in a persistent, accessible way without preventing the customization and valuable advertising that powers the Web economy. We are seeking ways to give users better insight and control into the ways their personal information is collected, used, stored and shared. Wikinews Do you think that all websites should respect DNT users' preferences in the long run? ::M: Mozilla is actively working with companies that have started to implement Do Not Track and with others who have committed to doing so. Ultimately, the goal is for all industry stakeholders to trust and respect the signal in the long run. Wikinews The mobile Firefox attitude to DNT is ...interesting! Thank you for the replies. Wikinews contacted the Wikimedia press office and got replies from Jay Walsh, senior director of communications at the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikinews Have you heard of ""Do Not Track"" feature support in modern browsers? What do you think about it? ::Jay Walsh: We're familiar with this feature of browsers. This provides the user with the option to remove user tracking, including cookies. It disrupts a lot of the technology used by digital ad services to follow users across sites etc. For the most part any users of the Foundation's projects would have no issues using the projects if they had Do Not Track enabled on their browser. The only issue they might have is in dismissing message banners on the projects (such as the fundraising banner) may not be completely predictable - banners may reappear after dismissing. Wikinews Given that not all companies respect this setting, do you feel its name misleading? Do you think it could better be named ""Do Not Target"" instead? ::JW: I'm not sure if you mean browser-making companies or web companies. Many users who activate this service are aware that by disabling user tracking they are effectively preventing ad or content targeting. We're not a browser software organization, so it's not a topic we spend a lot of time considering. However I think it's safe to say that our community (who are very active, opensource and free knowledge advocates) would like the maximum amount of transparency and clarity in these kinds of features for users. Wikinews Do you think that all websites should respect DNT users' preferences in the long run? ::JW: That's not really a question we're in the best position to answer. Obviously we take this kind of thing pretty seriously. From a software development perspective we would never want to confuse or frustrate a user by side-stepping a feature like do not track. We'd like all websites to honor a web user's preferences and desire for privacy of course. Obviously we're all looking at an Internet that relies increasingly on tracking technology to support commercial goals. Wikinews Would you ideally see the respect for DNT users' preferences legally enforced? ::JW: That would be a question for our legal counsel. But I'm sure it's a topic we'd want to research in more detail before reflecting on, and given that we're a non profit and we have pretty limited resources it's not always possible for us to have legal opinions on all matters."
tech,"Even though the USB 3.0 standard, with transmission speeds nearing 5Gbit/s (600MB/s), has not yet matured and is not expected until 2009 or 2010, technology leaders Intel, AMD, and nVidia are battling to take the lead on the USB 3.0 specifications. The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) was founded in 1995 by Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, NEC, and NXP Semiconductors. These companies are also promoting the new standard of USB 3.0. But AMD, nVidia, and VIA Technologies have jointly made an attempt to develop another ""USB 3.0"" standard to compete with Intel. The opportunity arose because Intel has yet to release their standard for USB 3.0. ""If the USB 3.0 have two different standards in the future, the consumer will be the greatest loser in this 'standard' battle. As of this issue, we the Federal Trade Commission decided to investigate Intel on monopolizing the specification of USB 3.0 and hope this conflict can be smoothly solved."" said the Federal Trade Commission in a statement. Nick Knupffer, a spokesperson for Intel, claimed that Intel will release related technical specifications on USB 3.0 for the Information Technology industry to prevent unnecessary conflicts on standards and specifications."
tech,"If you thought Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Moon was enough, then meet Google Mars. Google officially launched the new Google Mars yesterday as another add-on to Google Maps. The service offers three different ways to view Mars: elevation, visible landscape, and infrared view. The images come from two different NASA missions, Mars Global Surveyor and 2001 Mars Odyssey, and the data was prepared in collaboration with NASA researchers at Arizona State University. The color-coded elevation data is a shaded-relief map taken by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. The visible data is made from black and white images taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), which is also located onboard the Mars Global Surveyor, and the infrared images were produced by the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The THEMIS data is the sharpest map of Mars made so far, as it shows colder areas in darker colors and warmer regions in brighter colors, and as they are infrared images dust and clouds are transparent. Google has added various bookmarks showing points of interest such as landings of spacecraft, locations of mountains, and craters. The data is not currently available through Google's Google Earth client."
tech,"A complex series of events, including a five month-old computer error, was responsible for the battery failure that led to the loss of NASA's Mars Global Surveyor last year, an internal review board says. Findings from a preliminary report released on Friday say that while NASA controllers followed procedures while operating the craft, the procedures did not cover the types of errors that occurred. According to NASA, on November 2, 2006, the Global Surveyor was ordered to perform a routine adjustment of its solar panels. However, the Global Surveyor reoriented to an angle that exposed one of its two batteries to direct sunlight. The battery overheated, which led to the depletion of both batteries. An incorrect setting in antenna orientation prevented Global Surveyor from relaying its status to NASA controllers. Its preprogrammed systems did not take into account the need to maintain a thermally safe orientation. That was the last communication that NASA controllers had with the spacecraft. The Global Surveyor was the first US mission to Mars in twenty years, For ten years, the craft returned detailed information to NASA scientists providing new insights, including evidence that appeared to show the presence of water on Mars and identification of deposits of water-related minerals, which led to selection of a Mars rover landing site. ""The loss of the spacecraft was the result of a series of events linked to a computer error made five months before the likely battery failure,"" said Dolly Perkins, board chairperson and deputy director-technical of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The board concluded that NASA controllers had followed procedures, but that the procedures did not adequately cover the type of errors that occurred. In its final report, the board will offer recommendations applicable to future missions. ""We are making an end-to-end review of all our missions to be sure that we apply the lessons learned from Mars Global Surveyor to all our ongoing missions,"" said Fuk Li, Mars Exploration Program manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Global Surveyor was the longest operating spacecraft at Mars and had lasted four times longer than expected."
tech,"InfosectionEnd NASA has stated that they may extend the STS-117 Space Shuttle Atlantis mission by another two days to assist in the repair of 4 of the 6 computers that control the position, oxygen and water levels of the International Space Station (ISS) which failed, and have not come back on. As a result of the computer's failure, the thrusters on the station and the shuttle have been stabilizing the station's orbit. So far, only partial restoration has been made to at least some of the computer that controls the station's position, oxygen and water, but NASA says that some of the system still needs to be cleaned up. ""They've made a lot of progress. There are some cleanup steps to do still and some investigation,"" said space station flight director for NASA, Holly Ridings. Earlier NASA stated that, ""Russian flight controllers will be working overnight to resolve a problem with the Russian segment computers that provide backup attitude control and orbital altitude adjustments. For now, the station’s control moment gyroscopes are handling attitude control, with the shuttle’s propulsion providing backup."" It is not known what caused the computers to fail, but Russian engineers say that it could be a problem with power supply. This type of failure has not been observed before on the space station as re-booting the computers have fixed any problems that occurred in the past, but today, that did not work. ""We have plenty of resources, so we have plenty of time to sort this out,"" said manager of the space station program at NASA, Mike Suffredini. NASA officials state that there is an ""option to depart"" if at least one of the station's stabilizing computers cannot be fixed and the three member crew that is currently there, will have to be taken back to Earth in Atlantis. Without the computer that controls the oxygen levels, there is only 56 days of oxygen left available. NASA had already extended the shuttle's mission by two days on June 11 to repair a tear of at least four inches in the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS), which occurred during liftoff on June 8."
tech,"A Sea Launch Zenit-3SL rocket has successfully launched the DirecTV-11 Communications satellite for DirecTV. The Ukrainian-built rocket lifted off from the Norwegian Ocean Odyssey launch platform in the Pacific Ocean at 22:47:59 (UTC) yesterday evening, with spacecraft separation from the carrier rocket occurring at 23:49:03. The mission, which marked the 13th orbital launch of 2008, is the 25th commercial launch to be conducted by the international Sea Launch consortium, the first of which also lofted a DirecTV satellite. This is also the 250th flight of the Block DM upper stage, which is used on some variants of the Zenit and Proton rockets. Launch had been delayed from November 2007 due to damage to the launch platform caused by the failure of an earlier Zenit launch. Delays from earlier this month were caused by a problem with the satellite, resulting in a ten-day delay, and a further two-day delay from Monday evening due to an undisclosed problem with the rocket. DirecTV-11 is a Boeing 702 satellite, which will provide Direct-to-home High-definition television broadcasting services to houses in the United States, by means of Ka-band communications. It is one of three such satellites operated by DirecTV. The satellite made its first contact with the ground several hours after launch, at 05:44 GMT. The launch was dedicated to Arthur C. Clarke who died on Tuesday. Clarke, who was most well known for writing the book which 2001: A Space Odyssey was based on, was also the first person to suggest placing satellites into geosynchronous and geostationary orbits. DirecTV-11 will be placed into such an orbit. Sea Launch President Rob Peckham said that he ""feels good"" about the mission success, and that Sea Launch was ""proud of its role in DirecTV's continued success"". Steve O'Neill, the President of Boeing Satellite Systems, said that the launch was ""a great ride"", and thanked Sea Launch for their ""excellent work"". The satellite's initial orbit was confirmed to be 250km x 36484.8km x 0&amp;deg;, differing by only 2.8km from the planned orbit. Sea Launch have a further four launches planned for this year. In addition, its subsidiary Land Launch will conduct its first launch, using a Zenit-3SLB rocket from area 45/1 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to launch the AMOS-60 satellite. This is currently scheduled for mid-April. The next Sea Launch mission, with the Galaxy 18 satellite, is scheduled for May."
tech,"Environment Oil producer Royal Dutch Shell has confirmed that the Gannet Alpha oil platform, located 112 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland, has suffered a leak from an underwater pipeline between the wellhead and platform. Shell issued a statement regarding the incident, saying that ""We can confirm we are managing an oil leak in a flow line that serves the Gannet Alpha platform. ... We have stemmed the leak significantly and we are taking further measures to isolate it. The subsea well has been shut in, and the flow line is being depressurised."" The company has thus far refused to comment on the exact size of the leak, saying that was ""not a significant spill."" According to a Shell spokesperson, a remote submarine was deployed after a sheen was noticed in the water surrounding the platform; since then, a craft has been brought in to monitor water conditions in the area. The UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change has begun an investigation of the leak, with the Scottish government and Marine Scotland also involved in monitoring the situation."
tech,"The United States Space Shuttle Discovery docked with the International Space Station today at 5:12 p.m. ET. After a two-day journey, the space shuttle reached the space station for a week long stay to rewire the orbiting lab, install a new addition and rotate out a crew member. Astronaut Sunita ""Suni"" Williams will live for six months at the space lab, replacing German astronaut Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency.. An hour earlier the orbiter did a slow back flip so that crew members at the international space station could photograph its mid section for any signs of liftoff damage. This has been a routine procedure since the Columbia tragedy in which the space shuttle Columbia sustained damage on liftoff leading to its disintegration in the atmosphere. There appeared to be no problems with the heat shield so commander Mark Polansky continued the docking process. As the space station came into view of Discovery, Williams told Mission Control: ""It's beautiful."" Mission Control responded: ""I don't know what kind of creature comforts you're going to have, but you're going to have a room with a view."" A $11 million extension will be put into place on Tuesday during the first of the mission's three spacewalks. Astronauts plan to rewire the space lab, switching it from a temporary power source to a permanent one, during the two other spacewalks."
tech,"PakistanAn official website belonging to the Punjab Police of Pakistan was hacked on Friday, a private TV channel reported. The hackers left a message on the homepage in which they asked the Pakistani government to ""stop proxy war against India."" The messages of the chief minister and provincial inspector general were also erased from the site. Although the hackers have not been identified, Pakistani sources say the slogan left on the site points to Indian origins; cyber security experts confirmed this and added that 150 Pakistani websites were hacked in the last three days. The Punjab police website has been hacked twice recently; in one incident, the official emblem was replaced with the logo of the Indian Punjab Police. A police spokesman stated they would take legal action against an Islamabad-based company responsible for the website's security as well as stop the use of its services from July 31. “We are also going to give the domain hosting of the website and its maintenance, including the data update to the Punjab Information Technology Board.” The website has temporarily been shut down."
tech,"George Deutsch, a controversial George W. Bush appointee at NASA, resigned his post as press officer the same day that Texas A&amp;M University confirmed that he never graduated from the school. The resume of the 24-year old had claimed he received a ""Bachelor of Arts in journalism, Class of 2003."" Mr. Deutsch gained notoriety when it was revealed he had instructed NASA web site designers to insert the word ""theory"" at every mention of the Big Bang, on the grounds that it was a religious matter. ""This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA."" said Mr Deutsch in an e-mail. Mr. Deutsch also told public affairs workers to limit reporters' access to James Hansen, a top climate scientist and longtime director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen's lectures and papers were also to have been censored by public affairs workers. Dr. Hansen stated he would ignore the restrictions, which came through the less official channels of phone calls. Dr. Michael Griffin, NASA chief, appeared to back Dr. Hansen's claims of internal censorship, when he sent a strongly worded email message to all NASA employees stating ""It is not the job of public-affairs officers to alter, filter or adjust engineering or scientific material produced by NASA's technical staff."" Several other NASA employees reported similar tampering after the incident. NASA personnel told the New York Times that ""Mr. Deutsch played a small but significant role in an intensifying effort at the agency to exert political control over the flow of information to the public."" Climate science has long been linked with the space program because many of the underlying mathematical modeling techniques were originally developed to help understand the atmospheres of other planets, such as Venus. Mr. Deutsch was given his job in NASA's public affairs office in Washington after working on President Bush's re-election campaign and inaugural committee."
tech,"New Zealand Freelance journalist, Gabriel Pollard, spoke to Joe Stewart and David Farrar about the new anti-spam legislation in New Zealand that comes into effect today. Joe Stewart is the Unit Manager of the Department of Internal Affairs new Anti-Spam Compliance Unit, and David Farrar is Chair of InternetNZ’s Public Policy Committee, who also had significant input into the final bill. Keith Norris, CEO of the New Zealand Marketing Association, didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview. The anti-spam legislation, or the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007, promotes spam education and awareness and will enable international agencies to work together to share information and will enable cross-border pursuit of serious law breakers. And it doesn't just cover e-mail spam, but all electronic messaging such as SMS/text messaging, etc. However, New Zealand isn't the most up-to-date country with implementing similar legislation, Farrar says, “We are in fact almost the last country in the OECD to have such legislation.” He urges Eastern Europe and China to take part in the fight against spam. Stewart said that the new law would only help combat a small amount of spam, as 99%-99.9% of all spam received originates from overseas. He says the legislation alone will not solve the problem. As well as it helping to fight New Zealand-sourced spam and preventing New Zealand from “becoming a haven for spammers”, it will promote good practices within the e-marketing community, Stewart said. The new Act will affect legitimate marketers in New Zealand by making sure they have expressed or inferred consent to continue sending marketing messages to people on their database. Inferred consent is where the marketers have the e-mail address and send messages to those on their database, but didn't get expressed consent to send messages. Stewart does issue a warning against using inferred consent saying, “They may have been sending these people messages for years, but this does not establish consent.” A surge in emails has also been felt with companies/marketers making sure they have consent to continue the e-mails and asking those to confirm they wish to continue their subscription. “However, many marketers are already fulfilling these requirements because they are standard good e-marketing practice,” Stewart said. Due to legislative requirements, as well as having consent, businesses will have to provide details about the company sending the item, and provide a free way to unsubscribe from future mailings. Those found breaking these requirements deliberately could find themselves facing a personal fine of up to NZ$200,000. Organisations could face a fine of up to $500,000. Farrar said, “Experience from Australia shows most cases are dealt with by way of education.” Farrar also gives a final piece of advice to those annoyed with spam levels, “Never ever respond to a spam e-mail, and only give your real address out to people you trust.”"
tech,"The last British Skylark rocket has made its final flight. The rocket flew from coastal Sweden at 6am UTC on Monday, carrying its ESA science package to an altitude of 250km. The 13m tall rocket was developed in the UK and first flew in 1957 from Woomera range in Australia. It continued to be developed for another twenty years. The British government ended support for the project in 1979, leaving private companies to fly the remaining rockets. Enough rockets had been built to sustain a launch program until today. A total of 441 flights have been made by the sub-orbital Skylark. The rocket is known as a 'sounding rocket', designed to explore the upper regions of Earth's atmosphere."
tech,"Sharman Networks, owner of the popular Kazaa peer-to-peer software, lost against a coalition of record labels in an Australian federal court. The court ruled that Kazaa infringed on artists' copyright and facilitated piracy. The list of plaintiffs included EMI, Sony BMG, Warner, Festival Mushroom and Universal. The court has ordered Sharman to modify the software within two months to prevent further piracy. While this order is only valid in Australia, Sharman is incorporated in the country and thus the effect of the ruling will be felt in the peer to peer community worldwide. Sharman was also ordered to pay 90% of the plaintiff's legal fees, with damages to be considered at a later date. Sharman has said it will appeal. It is unclear whether this will have a significant effect on preventing piracy in the music industry. Surveys have shown that users have already abandoned Kazaa, which used to be the dominant peer to peer program used for sharing files, in favour of newer networks such as eDonkey and BitTorrent. This trend amongst users was also observed to happen with Grokster and Napster, two legacy peer-to-peer networks which faced similar suits. This is not the first case in which Sharman has had to defend itself: in a related case in the U.S. Supreme Court which concluded two months ago, the court ruled that file sharing networks could be held responsible for the actions of their users in some circumstances. This may have influenced this most recent case, where the court found the Kazaa website encouraged visitors to feel 'cool' about breaking copyright law and downloading illegal music. Kazaa, or other versions of it, has been estimated to be installed on up to 300 million computers worldwide."
tech,"NASA has extended the Space Shuttle Atlantis mission from 11 days to 13 days to attempt to fix a tear of at least four inches in the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS), which occurred during liftoff on June 8. A fourth spacewalk is also planned to take place. The tear was discovered when astronauts used the shuttle's robotic arm with digital cameras placed on the end. NASA says that the tear is not a major concern for re-entry, but they want to fix the problem before Atlantis returns, to reduce the amount of possible repairs Atlantis might need. ""I don't want to take the risk of damaging my flight hardware,"" said chairman of Atlantis's mission management team, John Shannon. Shannon said that it was unlikely that the tear would result in a disaster similar to that which occurred with the Space Shuttle Columbia which was lost in 2003 during re-entry. Atlantis will now return to Earth on June 21, rather than the original return date of June 19."

tech,"Kevin Martin, current head of the FCC, voiced his support on Wednesday for a tiered Internet. This plan would open the door for AT&amp;T, BellSouth, Verizon, and other telcos to limit bandwidth to popular web sites such as Google unless those sites paid significantly higher rates. Network neutrality is usually taken to mean that telcos and ISPs may not limit services or bandwidth, charge extra fees, or otherwise discriminate based upon a site's identity or content type. However, Mr. Martin said he viewed network neutrality as applying only to outright blocks, and that other forms of content- or identity-based pricing were acceptable and did not violate network neutrality. When the telcos began their recent lobbying campaign, Professor Michael Geist (University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law) said that ""While prioritising websites or applications may hold some economic promise, the lack of broadband competition and insufficient transparency surrounding these actions will rightly lead to growing calls for regulatory reform that grants legal protection for the principle of network neutrality."" According to The Nation, the multi-tiered approach being considered by the telcos could eventually expand to set limits on the number of downloads, media streams, or even email messages. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) has proposed legislation to prevent a two-tiered Internet."
tech,"One year after the Deepwater Horizon disaster which caused the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and caused huge environmental damage in the Gulf of Mexico, experts have warned there are serious questions over the safety of deep water drilling as the United States government approves more exploration without improving safety measures. Yale University Scientists have raised major concerns over repeated assurances from the industry and the government, who insist lessons have been learned from the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Charles Perrow, a professor at Yale University, said the oil industry ""is ill prepared at the least"" to deal with another oil spill. ""I have seen no evidence that they have marshaled containment efforts that are sufficient to deal with another major spill,"" he said. While the government has implemented new regulations, technical systems for stopping oil flowing from a leaking well, and increased oversight from oil officials, Perrow said deep water drilling had become no less dangerous. ""I don't think they have found ways to change the corporate culture sufficiently to prevent future accidents,"" he said. ""There are so many opportunities for things to go wrong that major spills are unavoidable."" Last year, Doug Inkley, a scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said the culture of an ""addiction to oil"" was ultimately responsible for the catastrophe. ""How long must we wait for lawmakers to act to prevent future disasters? How many more lives, livelihoods and animals must be claimed by our addiction to oil?"" Greenpeace also slammed BP, who ran Deepwater Horizon, for how they allowed the disaster to happen. ""The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now,"" the organization said. However, under pressure from industry executives the administration of president Barack Obama has resumed issuing drilling permits. It is understood regulators are still allowing oil companies to obtain drilling permits before reviewing new spill response plans. ""I'm not an oddsmaker, but I would say in the next five years we should have at least one major blowout,"" Perrow said. ""Even if everybody tries very hard, there is going to be an accident caused by cost-cutting and pressure on workers. These are moneymaking machines and they make money by pushing things to the limit."" BP has insisted it has changed safety procedures. The oil giant came under heavy criticism for how it handled the crisis, and other major oil companies insisted Deepwater Horizon was a result of a culture exclusive to BP. Michael Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), the U.S. government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling, said the view was ""as disappointing as it is shortsighted,"" and the issue of deep water safety was ""a broad problem."" The warnings came as it emerged BP had attempted to take control of an independent study into the environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Internal emails expose how BP executives attempted to influence the study, which was funded by a US$500m grant from the oil company. The study may be part of the final verdict as to what penalties, fines and criminal charges are brought against the company. Greenpeace, who uncovered the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request, attacked the reportedly unsuccessful attempts to influence the supposedly independent study as ""outrageous"". source=Diane Wilson, Gulf coast fisherwoman Protesters rallied outside BP's annual conference in London this week, where shareholders met for the first time since the disaster off the Gulf coast. Executives faced questions over their competence and large salaries from angry shareholders, many of whom disapproved of the appointment of Carl-Henric Svanberg as chairman and Sir Bill Castell as the head of BP's safety board. Some demonstrators purchased shares in BP in an attempt to get inside the meeting; one woman, a fisherwoman who lives on the Gulf Coast was arrested after pouring a black substance down herself at the entrance to the conference centre and refusing to move. ""I have travelled all the way over from the Gulf Coast and I just wanted to talk those responsible for destroying my community,"" she said as she was led away by police. ""My community is dead. We've worked five generations there and now we've got a dead community. I'm angry, I've been angry a long time."""
tech,"MP3s for the people? The Pirate Party, a new Swedish political party first publicized in January, wants to legalize sharing music, movies, and other copyrighted content using the Internet. What may seem like a doomed effort by a small group of idealists is attracting significant media attention, in part due to a recent police raid on The Pirate Bay, an extremely popular BitTorrent tracker (see Wikinews coverage). The Pirate Bay allows people to download content listed in its database using the BitTorrent protocol (including the latest Hollywood movies or computer games) and has gained something of an international cult status, in part for its public and irreverent responses to legal threats received from copyright lawyers of major corporations. The site was reopened days after the raid on Dutch servers (but is now back in Sweden again). Rickard Falkvinge, leader of the Pirate Party, argues that regardless of the legal outcome in the case, the web site demonstrates that copyright law in its current form is not sustainable. Adopting the moniker of the maligned ""Internet pirates"", the party argues for drastically limiting the scope and enforcement of copyright law, abolishing patent law, and protecting privacy in what it sees as a ""control and surveillance society"". The party is hoping to garner enough votes in the September election to become a small but important faction in the next Swedish parliament. Rickard Falkvinge found some time in between interviews and party work to answer our questions. There are rumours that the Swedish government was indirectly acting on behalf of the U.S. MPAA in shutting down the site. Do you feel that your government is beholden to U.S. interests? Oh, the MPAA said so themselves in a press release, it's more than a rumor. Check their press release ""Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay"". below And yes, this particular fact has caused something of an uproar in Sweden. It's widely believed that Swedish authorities were more or less ordered by a foreign power to act forcefully against an entity that was in, at worst, a legal gray area according to Swedish law. The raid must have boosted your recognition. How many members do you currently have, and how successful has your fundraising effort been so far? Our member count is at 6540, no, 6541, no wait, 6543... well, you get the picture. Our members register themselves on our website after paying the membership fee electronically, which helps reduce our admin load considerably. Fundraising brought in 108,000 SEK Ed.: approx. 14,700 USD or 11,600 EUR, enough to buy 3 million ballots, which is some kind of at-least-we're-not-starving minimum. We're not full, but we're not starving, either. Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, we have received another 50K in donations. My sincere thanks to everybody who wants to help out; we are now looking into getting more ballots to make sure we don't run out on election day. (10 million ballots was our initial full-score aim.) Do you think you will be able to cover future expenses such as radio and television ads? Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, and our tripling of the member roster, we don't need advertising. We've been mentioned almost every news hour across all channels on national television in the last week. Also, the established parties have now started to turn, following our success. Parties representing almost half of the elected parliament are now describing today's copyright situation as not working. They still don't understand why, though, they are just echoing what we say without understanding what the words mean. We'll get around to teaching them &amp;mdash; them and the voters alike. This might be hard for people not following the Swedish media to grasp, but we have made a big splash. Today, our Minister of Justice was quoted as saying that he's open to changes to copyright laws that would make file-sharing legal, with the headline ""Bodström (his name) flip-flops about file sharing."" Immediately underneath were the Pirate Party's comments to his suggestions. Let's take that again: when a minister makes a statement about file sharing, media calls us for comments, and publishes them next to that statement. That's how big we have become since the raid on the Pirate Bay. The Minister of Justice later denied having made that statement to the press that reported it. We will never be able to pay for television ads, the way I see it. Unless a very wealthy donor comes on stage. (If any such person is reading this, we have planned how to spend up to $375,000 in a cost-efficient way up until the elections, on the chance that donations appear. That spending does still not include any TV ads.) Are you aware of similar initiatives in other countries? Some are trying, but none have achieved the necessary momentum and critical mass that we have. We expect that momentum to happen once we get into Swedish Parliament and show that it can be done. Intellectual property activism category on Wikipedia The name ""Pirate Party"" seems to identify the party with what is currently defined as a crime: piracy of software, movies, music, and so on. Will a name like ""Pirate Party"" not antagonize voters, given that the label is so negatively used? How about potential allies abroad who argue for a more balanced copyright regime, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Creative Commons? Oh, it is a crime. That's the heart of the problem! The very problem is that something that 20% of the voters are doing is illegal by punishment of jail time. That's what we want to change. Where the established parties are saying that the voters are broken, we are saying it's the law that is broken. Besides, it's a way of reclaiming a word. The media conglomerates have been pointing at us and calling us pirates, trying to make us somehow feel shame. It doesn't work. We wear clothes saying ""PIRATE"" in bright colors out on the streets. Yes, we are pirates, and we're proud of it, too. Also, the term is not that negative at all in Sweden, much thanks to the awesome footwork of the Pirate Bureau (Piratbyrån), who have been working since 2003 to educate the public. If you are elected, and have the opportunity to become part of the next government of Sweden, do you intend to focus only on the issues in your platform (IP law and privacy)? Our current plan is to support the government from the parliament, but not be part of it. If we're part of it, that means we get a vested interest to not overthrow it, which puts us in a weaker position if they start going against our interests. Overall, our strategy is to achieve the balance of power, where both the left and right blocks need our votes to achieve a majority, and then support the issues of whichever government that agrees to drive our issues the strongest. Basically, we sell our votes on other issues to the highest bidder in exchange for them driving ours. Have you already made any contacts in Swedish politics? Contacts... I'm not sure what you mean. Several of us have been shaking hands with some of the established politicians, particularly in the youth leagues, if that's what you mean. I was thinking along the lines of exploring possible modes of cooperation with established political parties &amp;mdash; are you already taken seriously? We are taken seriously by most of the youth leagues and by at least one of the represented parties. In particular, which is what counts, we are now taken seriously by national media. However, we can't tie contacts that explore modes of cooperation quite yet &amp;mdash; since our strategy depends on holding the balance of power, we need to not express a preference for whom we'd like to cooperate with, or we'd put ourselves in a weaker bargaining position. What is your position on moral rights, as recognized by European Union copyright laws: the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. Do you think these rights should be preserved? We safeguard the right to attribution very strongly. After all, what we are fighting for is the intent of copyright as it is described in the US constitution: the promotion of culture. Many artists are using recognition as their primary driving force to create culture. Publishing anonymously or pseudonymously happens every day on the Internet, so no big deal there either. The right to integrity, however, is an interesting issue. We state that we are for free sampling, meaning you can take a sound that I made for my tune and use it in your own tunes, or for that matter, a whole phrase. That's partially in line with today's copyright law on derivative works; as long as you add your own creative touch to a work, you get your own protection for the derivation. We want to strengthen that right. You might want to consider the alternative. In the 50s and 60s, a lot of rock and roll bands started doing covers of old classical music. This would almost certainly have been considered to violate the integrity of the original artist &amp;mdash; and was considered to do so by many &amp;mdash; but in the eyes of many others, it was instead great new culture of a previously unseen form and shape. So I don't have a definite answer on the integrity issue. While I am leaning towards the promotion of new culture taking precedence over a limitation right, there may be unconsidered cases. Do you feel that trademark law is adequate as it is? Yes. We have not seen any hidden costs to trademarks that outweigh the benefits of reducing transaction costs on a market where seller and buyer are not personally acquainted. How do you intend to deal with EU treaties which define certain legal frameworks for the protection of intellectual works? What can they do? Fine us? Send us an angry letter? Come on, countries need to think more like corporations. If the fine is less than the cost to society, which it is in this case, then the right thing to do is to accept the fine with a polite ""thank you"". Actually, national media just called me about this very question; the Department of Justice has stated that we can't allow file sharing, as it would break international treaties. My response was that it is more important to not have 1.2 million Swedes criminalized, than it is to avoid paying a penalty fee. Do you think that weaker intellectual property laws would lessen the amount of products released in Sweden by foreign companies, such as Hollywood studios? As long as they believe that they will have a revenue here that exceeds the cost of operations, they will keep coming here. Anything else would be wrong from a corporate standpoint. Besides, you need to remember what we are doing is to change the map according to what reality looks like. We do not want to change people's behavior. We want to change the law so it reflects what the world actually looks like. So, as they apparently make a profit today, I expect that to continue. Do you feel that the music industry in its current form will still be needed in a world where non-commercial copying is permitted? It's not so much if they are needed where non-commercial copying is permitted, rather if they are needed when they're not necessary any more to be the middle man between consumer and artist. The music industry will lose its current chokepoint, because they don't add any value to the end product any longer. They will probably survive as a service bureau for artists, but they will not be able to control distribution. It's actually quite simple: if they get their act together and provide a service that people want to buy, they will remain. If not, they will vanish. Today, they have legislated that people must buy their service regardless of whether it adds value or not, and that's not gonna hold in the long term. Why fight against intellectual property laws, instead of focusing your energy on creating freely licensed content, such as Creative Commons films or open source software? I want to raise the issue a level, to show that it's not about payment models or what level of control the copyright holder chooses to exert over his or her work. Let me put it this way: we have achieved the technical possibility of sending copyrighted works in digital, private communications. I can send a piece of music in e-mail to you, I can drop a video clip in a chat room. That technology is not going away, leaving us with two choices. So &amp;mdash; if copyright is to be enforced &amp;mdash; if you are to tax, prohibit, fee, fine, or otherwise hinder the transmission of copyrighted works in private communications, the only way to achieve that is to have all private communications constantly monitored. It's really that large. Also, this is partly nothing new. We've been able to do this since the advent of the Xerox copier &amp;mdash; you could photocopy a poem or a painting and put it in a letter in the mail. Again, the only way to discover or stop that would have been for the authorities to open all letters and check their content. So we're at a crossroads here. Either we, as a society, decide that copyright is the greater value to society, and take active steps to give up private communications as a concept. Either that, or we decide that the ability to communicate in private, without constant monitoring by authorities, has the greater value &amp;mdash; in which case copyright will have to give way. My choice is clear. The Pirate Bay was shut down and re-opened days later on a Dutch server. According to a Swedish newspaper report, traffic has doubled since then. How long do you think the cat and mouse game will continue? Until one of two things happen: The authorities realize they can't enforce laws that require monitoring all private communications, especially given the large international level of grassroots support, or they actually start monitoring all private communications. 2006-06-22 Politics of Sweden"
tech,"New Zealand New stars have been recently discovered in the Southern Cross, or Crux, by scientists in the United States. This discovery could affect the flags of New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Brazil, although the new star is located very close to the westernmost star and invisible to the naked eye. The American scientists found the new stars in the Southern Cross by using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a space satellite run by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) which uses x-rays. When the scientist team, led by David Cohen of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, were using the Chandra telescope, they, to their surprise, saw two x-ray glows, each representing stars, where they expected to see one. The new star appears to be orbiting Beta Crucis, the westernmost star in the Southern Cross, once every 2,000 years. Doctor Nick Lomb, an astronomer at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia, said that the reason the star had not been found before was because the glare from Beta Crucis is too great and ""It would be like looking for a glow worm next to a floodlight."" Before the recent discovery, it was already known that Beta Crucis had a partner, which is invisible to the human-eye. Australian news Mr Cohen said that they found it by accident, as they were really trying to get information about the x-rays emitted by Beta Crucis. ""We were interested in how the highly supersonic stellar winds of hot, luminous stars produce X-rays."" The star found at the bottom of the Southern Cross, Alpha Crucis ""Acrux"", also has a partner star, which is also invisible to the human-eye. This invisible partner is not featured on any flags. Dr Lomb said the apparent separation between each star is like looking at two headlights from 100 kilometres away, even though the two stars are actually 60 billion kilometres away from each other. Dr Lomb said that if Australia was to put all eight stars in the Southern Cross onto the Australia flag then ""the flag would have to be huge, probably the size of Sydney."" Astronomer Alan Gilmore from University of Canterbury's Mount John observatory, also agreed that flags should not be altered because it is not about how many stars there are in the Southern Cross, but the magnitude of the stars. Mr Gilmore said: ""What you see by eye is what you see on the flag. If you wanted to add more stars, there's no end of stars you can put on if you go down in order of brightness. It would get very confusing."" Mr Gilmore has said that in 20,000 years that Southern Cross will be different anyway, because the top star, Gamma Crucis is 90 light years away from Earth, while Alpha Crucis, Beta Crucis and Delta Crucis are all around 350 light years away and they are all moving in different directions.

tech,"Scientists say that floating inside Saturn's rings are pieces of what they believe to be a ""shattered moon,"" according to images captured by NASA's spacecraft Cassini–Huygens. The scientists from the University of Colorado at Boulder looked at the images which were captured in 2004, and found what they call ""moonlets"" or large pieces ranging from the size of a stadium to a semi truck, of what they say are the remains of a large moon which was likely destroyed when a comet or asteroid slammed into it. ""This is the first evidence of a moonlet belt in any of Saturn's rings. We have firmly established these moonlets exist in a relatively narrow region of the ""A"" ring, and the evidence indicates they are remnants of a larger moon that was shattered by a meteoroid or comet,"" said one of the researchers, Miodrag Sremcevic. The Cassini spacecraft captures eight new propeller-like features within Saturn's A ring in what may be the propeller ""hot zone"" of Saturn's rings. Propeller features form around small moonlets that are not massive enough to clear out ring material, but are still able to pull smaller ring particles into a shape reminiscent of an airplane propeller. Scientists believe that propellers represent moonlet wakes, which are denser than the surrounding ring material and appear bright in the images. The length of the belt in which the moonlets were discovered is almost 2,000 miles long. Scientists estimate that the size of the moon was relative to the size of Pan, the innermost moon of Saturn. It only measures 20 miles wide at its widest point."
tech,"BBC News is reporting that the People's Republic of China has successfully launched its second manned space flight, Shenzhou VI. The mission is more ambitious than the previous Shenzhou V, which made China only the third nation to launch a manned space mission. Shenzhou VI will carry two astronauts, Nie Haisheng and Fei Junlong, compared to the previous mission which only carried a single astronaut, Yang Liwei. The newest astronauts will also stay in orbit longer, five days compared to the 21 hour, 14 orbit flight of Shenzhou V. The director of the Chinese Space Crew Training program, Chen Shanguang, explained to the media that the country would send a woman to Space within five years. ""Women are more patient compared with male astronauts, their psychological qualities are more stable and they face isolation better,"" according to Chen."

tech,"European astronomers discovered a very young and huge star cluster within our Milky Way galaxy using European Southern Observatory telescopes. The discovery was made at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Hidden behind a veil of dust and gas, the super star cluster, known as Westerlund 1, is 1000 times closer than any other known clusters. These Super star clusters were previously known to exist as pairs or groups of interacting galaxies located at immense intergalactic distances. It is so close--within 10,000 light years--scientists will be able to examine its structure in detail. Until now, super clusters were far too distant for individual stars to be distinguished. Initial observations have led scientists to conclude the group contains at least 100,000 times the mass of the Sun, with some single stars shining with a power of 1,000,000 suns and 2000 times larger than our own. All the stars are in a region less than six light years across. The existence of Westerlund 1's has been known since 1961. Discovered by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund while in Australia, the cluster is located in the Southern constellation Ara (the Altar). It was a dimming factor of more than 100,000 caused by the gas and dust between us and the cluster that prevented the actual structure and nature of the phenomenon to be determined. Using a variety of instruments, including the Wide Field Imager (WFI) attached to a 2.2 meter scope and the Superb-Seeing Imager 2 (SuSI2) camera on the ESO 3.5 meter New Technology Telescope (NTT), 200 cluster member stars were identified. These and other observations have revealed the cluster contains young stars on the order of 30-40 times more massive than our own Sun. The age range has been determined at 3.5 to five million years old, making this cluster very young compared to the Galaxy itself at around 13.5 billion years. The research will appear in the leading research journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, and is titled ""On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster Westerlund 1"", by J.S. Clark and colleagues. A second paper, ""Further Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1"", by Ignacio Negueruela and Simon Clark will also be published in the same journal."
tech,"Space A faulty ammonia line fitting delayed repairs to a cooling pump on the International Space Station Saturday during an eight-hour spacewalk. During the spacewalk, astronauts Doug Wheelock and Tracy Caldwell Dyson were to repair a faulty cooling system, which failed on July 31. The faulty cooling unit was to be swapped with a new one that was previously in storage to solve the problem; however, an ammonia leak in the final line to be disconnected from the unit halted attempts for a repair. Upon discovering the problem, the astronauts were instructed to reconnect the line and install a positioning device to maintain the proper pressure on the line. Upon completing the spacewalk, Wheelock and Dyson spent additional time in the airlock to get rid of any ammonia particles that may have attached themselves to their spacesuits. NASA officials are analyzing possible solutions to the issue to attempt during a planned spacewalk Wednesday. Wednesday's spacewalk was previously intended to be second in the series to repair the cooling system by reattaching fluid and electrical lines. Before Saturday's spacewalk, NASA officials projected that up to three spacewalks may be needed to repair the cooling system. Most of the space station's non-critical scientific components have been temporarily shut-down in order to reduce heat generation with only one cooling loop available to the station. NASA reports that the station's crew, three Russians and three Americans, are not in any danger; however, it is in the best interests of the crew to restore systems to nominal condition as soon as possible. The eight-hour spacewalk is reportedly the longest ISS-based spacewalk, and the sixth longest in the history of human spaceflight."
tech,"__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__ A report accidentally published on the Internet provides insight into a secretive European Union surveillance project designed to monitor its citizens, as reported by Wikileaks earlier this month. Project INDECT aims to mine data from television, internet traffic, cellphone conversations, p2p file sharing and a range of other sources for crime prevention and threat prediction. The €14.68 million project began in January, 2009, and is scheduled to continue for five years under its current mandate. INDECT produced the accidentally published report as part of their ""Extraction of Information for Crime Prevention by Combining Web Derived Knowledge and Unstructured Data"" project, but do not enumerate all potential applications of the search and surveillance technology. Police are discussed as a prime example of users, with Polish and British forces detailed as active project participants. INDECT is funded under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), and includes participation from Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Indicated in the initial trial's report, the scope of data collected is particularly broad; days of television news, radio, newspapers, and recorded telephone conversations are included. Several weeks of content from online sources were agglomerated, including mining Wikipedia for users' and article subjects' relations with others, organisations, and in-project movements. Watermarking of published digital works such as film, audio, or other documents is discussed in the Project INDECT remit; its purpose is to integrate and track this information, its movement within the system and across the Internet. An unreleased promotional video for INDECT located on YouTube is shown to the right. The simplified example of the system in operation shows a file of documents with a visible INDECT-titled cover taken from an office and exchanged in a car park. How the police are alerted to the document theft is unclear in the video; as a ""threat"", it would be the INDECT system's job to predict it. Throughout the video use of CCTV equipment, facial recognition, number plate reading, and aerial surveillance give friend-or-foe information with an overlaid map to authorities. The police proactively use this information to coordinate locating, pursuing, and capturing the document recipient. The file of documents is retrieved, and the recipient roughly detained. Technology research performed as part of Project INDECT has clear use in countering industrial and international espionage, although the potential use in maintaining any security and predicting leaks is much broader. Quoted in the UK's Daily Telegraph, Liberty's director, Shami Chakrabarti, described a possible future implementation of INDECT as a ""sinister step"" with ""positively chilling"" repercussions Europe-wide. ""It is inevitable that the project has a sensitive dimension due to the security focussed goals of the project,"" Suresh Manandhar, leader of the University of York researchers involved in the ""Work Package 4"" INDECT component, responded to Wikinews. ""However, it is important to bear in mind that the scientific methods are much more general and has wider applications. The project will most likely have lot of commercial potential. The project has an Ethics board to oversee the project activities. As a responsible scientists sic it is of utmost importance to us that we conform to ethical guidelines."" Should the EU carry out this research without a wider public debate? Although Wikinews attempted to contact Professor Helen Petrie of York University, the local member of Project INDECT's Ethics board, no response was forthcoming. The professor's area of expertise is universal access, and she has authored a variety of papers on web-accessibility for blind and disabled users. A full list of the Ethics board members is unavailable, making their suitability unassessable and distancing them from public accountability. One potential application of Project INDECT would be implementation and enforcement of the U.K.'s ""MoD Manual of Security"". The 2,389-page 2001 version passed to Wikileaks this month &amp;mdash; commonly known as JSP-440, and marked ""RESTRICTED"" &amp;mdash; goes into considerable detail on how, as a serious threat, investigative journalists should be monitored, and effectively thwarted; just the scenario the Project INDECT video could be portraying. When approached by Wikinews about the implications of using INDECT, a representative of the U.K.'s Attorney General declined to comment on legal checks and balances such a system might require. Further U.K. enquiries were eventually referred to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who have not yet responded. Wikinews Brian McNeil contacted Eddan Katz, the International Affairs Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (E.F.F.). Katz last spoke to Wikinews in early 2008 on copyright, not long after taking his current position with the E.F.F. He was back in Brussels to speak to EU officials, Project INDECT was on his agenda too &amp;mdash; having learned of it only two weeks earlier. Katz linked Project INDECT with a September report, NeoConopticon &amp;mdash; The EU Security-Industrial Complex, authored by Ben Hayes for the Transnational Institute. The report raises serious questions about the heavy involvement of defence and IT companies in ""security research"". On the record, Katz answered a few questions for Wikinews. WNIQ Is this illegal? Is this an invasion of privacy? Spying on citizens? :Eddan Katz When the European Parliament issued the September 5, 2001 report on the American ECHELON system they knew such an infrastructure is in violation of data protection law, undermines the values of privacy and is the first step towards a totalitarian surveillance information society. WNIQ Who is making the decisions based on this information, about what? :E.K. What's concerning to such a large extent is the fact that the projects seem to be agnostic to that question. These are the searching systems and those people that are working on it in these research labs do search technology anyway. ... but its inclusion in a database and its availability to law enforcement and its simultaneity of application that's so concerning, ... because the people who built it aren't thinking about those questions, and the social questions, and the political questions, and all this kind of stuff. ... It seems like it's intransparent, unaccountable. The E.U. report Katz refers to was ratified just six days before the September 11 attacks that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In their analysis of the never-officially-recognised U.S. Echelon spy system it states, ""in principle, activities and measures undertaken for the purposes of state security or law enforcement do not fall within the scope of the EC Treaty."" On privacy and data-protection legislation enacted at E.U. level it comments, ""such does not apply to 'the processing of data/activities concerning public security, defence, state security (including the economic well-being of the state when the activities relate to state security matters) and the activities of the state in areas of criminal law'"". Part of the remit in their analysis of Echelon was rumours of 'commercial abuse' of intelligence; ""if a Member State were to promote the use of an interception system, which was also used for industrial espionage, by allowing its own intelligence service to operate such a system or by giving foreign intelligence services access to its territory for this purpose, it would undoubtedly constitute a breach of EC law ... activities of this kind would be fundamentally at odds with the concept of a common market underpinning the EC Treaty, as it would amount to a distortion of competition"". Ben Hayes' NeoConoptiocon report, in a concluding section, ""Following the money"", states, ""what is happening in practice is that multinational corporations are using the ESRP European Seventh Research Programme to promote their own profit-driven agendas, while the EU is using the programme to further its own security and defence policy objectives. As suggested from the outset of this report, the kind of security described above represents a marriage of unchecked police powers and unbridled capitalism, at the expense of the democratic system."""
tech,"wikimediamention Wikinews has learned that the Wikimedia Foundation has decided not to participate in a panel discussion that is to take place at Santa Clara University in California. The discussion, which is titled 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' was to be based on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia and ethics involved in the editing of the website. It is the ninth such meeting in a series on technology, ethics, and law and is taking place today. In an e-mail to Wikinews, Miriam Schulman the communications director for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University which is to host the discussion, states that Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Foundation, will not be speaking during the discussion as was originally planned. According to Schulman, Godwin canceled his scheduled appearance just one week ago and has decided not to have anyone from the foundation replace him. Valleywag, a gossip website about technology, recently reported that Godwin was not attending due to a ""groundswell of criticism of Wikipedia"". ""I don't want to speak for Mr. Godwin or Wikimedia, but someone else made an incorrect assumption about this, so let me clarify that in our understanding, the problem was never with the composition of the panel. Mike Godwin, General Counsel of Wikimedia, was scheduled to participate in the panel, 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' on May 15. Last week, Mr. Godwin informed us that he would not participate, and subsequent discussions with Wikimedia Foundation indicated that they would not designate a replacement speaker,"" stated Schulman to Wikinews. ""This is our ninth such panel (in addition to the hundreds of events on other topics our centers run each year), and we feel confident in our ability to set a respectful tone for discourse on controversial topics,"" added Schulman. Schulman would not comment on the reason for the Foundation's decision. Wikinews also attempted to contact Godwin, but was directed to Jay Walsh who is the head of communications for the Foundation, but Wikinews has not received a response. The panel was to include Carl Hewitt an electrical and computer science engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Godwin discussing Wikipedia with Pedro Hernández-Ramos, associate director for the Center for Science, Technology, and Society moderating the discussion. The plan was to discuss Wikipedia, and what does and doesn't work for the encyclopedia. ""This panel will explore what works and what doesn't in the Wikipedia editing model from the angles of ethics, expertise, education, and the law,"" said a statement on the Center's website. Schulman states that the discussion, which is open to the public, is ""still planned"" for Thursday May 15 at 6:00 p.m. (pacific time) at the De Saisset Museum on the university's campus, but it is not yet known if anyone outside the Foundation will be replacing Godwin. The High Tech Law Institute along with the Ethics Center are sponsoring the discussion. Both individuals are still attending the discussion. ""These events are always open to the public, which means everyone is welcome. In this kind of setting, we invite anyone with an interest in the topic,"" stated Schulman to Wikinews. The Foundation is the parent organization of Wikipedia and other projects such as Wikinews and Wikimedia Commons, a Wiki dedicated to hosting images that can be used throughout the projects of the Foundation."
tech,"It is reported that The Head of RosAtom Russia’s Federal Atomic Agency, Sergei Kiriyenko, will meet Iran’s Foreign Minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, in Tehran December 11 to discuss economic affairs of mutual interest. Kiriyenko, former Russian Prime Minister, had proposed in February this year, that Russia would provide Iran with enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, thus avoiding the need for Iran to build plants that might be used for weapon production. Since then there have been Security Council resolutions and threats of economic sanctions against Iran which has persisted in building an enrichment plant. Russia has been building a light water reactor for Iran at Bushehr but there have been delays in completion, ‘for technical reasons’. The original reactors at Busheh, contracted to be built by Siemens in 1975, were bombed in 1985 and 1988 by Iraq. Now, having trained Iranian troops in their use, Russia is delivering a consignment of Tor-M1 missiles to Iran. These are ground to air missiles for defence purposes with a range of about 18,000 feet."
tech,"An asteroid the size of Pluto that slammed into the Northern hemisphere of Mars created the Borealis basin, based on the latest survey of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Global Surveyor. The report released by the magazine Nature explains the 1984 observation of the unusual shape of Mars terrain in the northern hemisphere against the southern hemisphere. An asteroid with a body of 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) smashed into the planet some 3.9 billion years ago, creating the vast Borealis basin (measuring 8,500km 5,300 miles by 10,600km 6,600 miles across), which occupies nearly 40 per cent of the Martian surface. The new data has convinced a lot of scientists, but the theory will need further proof before being accepted by the wider scientific community."
tech,"Following the return of the Stardust space capsule from its encounter with the Comet Wild 2, NASA scientists have come up with a novel approach to dealing with the samples of ""interstellar dust"" that have been collected; they want help from the public. The Stardust spacecraft carried an aerogel-based dust collector, which was exposed to space in varying orientations during different phases of the mission.Stardust@homeOnly one side of the collector was exposed towards the stream of particles coming off the Comet Wild 2 during the encounter in 2004, while the other side was used to collect interstellar dust at an earlier point in the spacecraft's journey. Although scientists have seen the particles captured from comet Wild 2 when they examined the aerogel, they have not examined any of the particles expected on the other side of the collector due to their smallness. They will be examined after they are found with the help of Stardust@home. It is believed that on the order of 50 interstellar dust particles impacted the aerogel, each now resting inside a tiny crater. Stardust traveled nearly three billion miles and its mission lasted seven years. At times it was traveling at 8 miles a second. Thats fast enough to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles in one minute. Stardust set a new all-time record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the previous record set in May of 1969 during the return of the Apollo X(10) command module. Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Seattle said ""our spacecraft has traveled further than anything from Earth ever has – and came back. We went half-way to Jupiter to meet the comet and collect samples from it. But the comet actually came in from the outer edge of the solar system, out beyond the orbit of Neptune, out by Pluto."" In a move similar to some distributed computing projects, the analysis work for the project will be spread among volunteers on the Internet, who are being asked to participate in this scientific undertaking. Wikinews reporter Jason Safoutin investigated the Stardust@home project, and discussed its goals with one of its founders. Via email, he interviewed David P. Anderson, a founder of the SETI@home project, and one of the creators of the Virtual Microscope which will be used to search for captured particles from interstellar space. I was wondering If I could get some questions answered or if you could give me some ""insider"" info for the project. I am aware that you are taking place in the development of the VM (Virtual Microscope)...Could I know more about that? The 'virtual microscope' lets you scan through a set of images as if you were turning the focus knob on a microscope. The images are fairly large (about 100 KB each) so it's important to pre-load the images. While you're looking through one set of images, the VM is busy downloading the JPEG files for the next set. At first we thought we'd have to do this with a Java applet or Flash program - something tricky and complicated. My contribution was to point out that it could be done fairly easily using Javascript, and I wrote a prototype of this. Will this project use the BOINC Platform/Program? SETI@home No. We thought about using some parts of BOINC (like the database and web pages for creating ""accounts"") but it was easier just to do this from scratch. How long will the project take? It depends how many volunteers participate, and how fast they look at the 'focus movies'. It will probably be just a month or two. Anyone can join but they have to take a test before they can participate. What will the test include? Looking at some focus movies and deciding whether they contain a dust particle. Participants see a lot of training examples before they take the test. It's easy, not like a test in school. How many will be allowed to participate? No limit as of now. When will the project start? I think in about 2 months. It will take that long to transport the aerogel to the laboratory, and photograph it with the microscope. The software is ready to go. Will the VM project analyze any of the particles or just look for them? Stardust@home will only locate the particles. When they are located, they will be cut out of the aerogel and physically analyzed. Thank you for your time David. And great work on the upcoming project and SETI@home."

tech,"If you've noticed a fuzzy yellowish object at night in the northeast sky, immediately to the left of the constellation Perseus, that's because it is the Comet Holmes which has suddenly gotten brighter in what scientists say is ""absolutely unprecedented"" in comet research. Earlier reports were that the object might have been a star that went super nova, or that a new star might have formed, but because the comet does not have a tail, the earlier reports were later dismissed. ""This is a terrific outburst, and since it doesn't have a tail right now, some observers have confused it with a nova. We've had at least two reports of a new star. When the Deep Impact probe hit Comet 9P Tempel, there was almost no change in brightness. This outburst by Comet Holmes is extreme!"" said Minor Planet Center director, Brian Marsden. Not more than a few days ago, the comet began to get brighter and appear larger in the sky, in what scientists call an ""outburst."" The comet is usually only visible through telescopes, but the outburst has caused it to be visible through the naked eye and it will continue to grow brighter with its coma eventually reaching the size of The Moon. Currently, only people living in the Northern Hemisphere are able to get a glimpse of the show. Binoculars and a small telescope can be used to get a close up view. The comet took just 24 hours to get more than 400,000 times brighter than it usually is, and is currently over one million times brighter, but Marsden says the comet's brightness could dim in days or even weeks. The comet was discovered on November 6, 1892 by Edwin Holmes while he was looking at the Andromeda Galaxy through his telescope. Researchers say that the comet may also have had an outburst at the time it was discovered. It was seen once after that in 1899 and then 1906, but disappeared until it was ""rediscovered"" in 1964 after a prediction Marsden had made. ""Since then, it’s been behaving well – until now,"" added Marsden."
tech,"NASA officials decided late Monday to go ahead with the planned launch at 2:38 p.m. EDT on July 4 of the space shuttle Discovery. The launch, from Cape Canaveral in Florida, had previously been delayed twice due to poor weather conditions. The expected 13-day mission has been described as critical to the future of the International Space Station (ISS) as well as the shuttle and the entire NASA fleet. There were concerns over a 5"" by 1/2"" crack in the insulation foam that was found late last night. NASA officials dismissed the crack saying it was less than the size required to cause damage at launch. The Discovery mission is to deliver critical supplies to the ISS, test shuttle-inspection techniques and to drop off European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Reiter for his 6-month stay in the ISS. Over the last three years, NASA has spent an estimated $1.3 billion to remedy the foam problem. When asked about the foam concern, NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier said, ""We're about the same risk as we were before ... I don't think we're taking any additional risks."" Officials have said that they expect foam to fall during the launch though. A few senior NASA safety and technical officers have their voiced opposition to the launch, claiming that they need more time to work on the foam-shedding problem. Foam debris coming loose was the cause of the Columbia disaster in 2003. It is widely expected that another major problem with the launch would lead to the entire NASA fleet being grounded. A grounded fleet, in turn, will put the $100 billion International Space Station in a difficult situation, since the shuttle has been the major means of delivering supplies to it. This mission is to be one of the last few flights of the space shuttle Discovery, which is set to retire in 2010."

tech,"Scientists have announced that the largest radio telescope array in the world, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is to be built in either Africa or Australia and will be composed of thousands of antenna arrays that will be capable of detecting the first galaxies and stars formed in our universe. The control center for the array is announced to be located in the United Kingdom in Manchester, England at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. ""The next generation radio telescope - the Square Kilometer Array – will carry on this tradition of innovation. The goal is to construct a network of antennas working at centimeter to meter wavelengths with 100 times the sensitivity of the largest existing arrays. This telescope will play a major role in the following decades, alongside other next generation facilities in the millimeter, optical/IR, X-ray and so on, in further exploring the content and evolution of the universe,"" said a press released on SKA's website. Construction will begin in 2012 and cost over US$2 billion (£1 billion, €1.4 billion) to build. The array will reportedly begin operation by the year 2020. SKA decided to release the details of the array plans on the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik. At least 17 different countries and 55 schools, universities, engineers and astronomers are expected to take involvement in the project. The array will be built in one of two locations. The first option is in Mileura, Australia. According to SKA's website, the location is ideal because ""only 100,000 people inhabit the five million square kilometers of the interior"" area of western Australia, making it one of ""the most radio-quiet locations on Earth."" The second option is in South Africa in Northern Cape Province because of the ""dry climate, a good existing infrastructure of roads and power reticulation, a low Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI), low land prices and low operating costs"" and ""has a appropriately skilled workforce and a well-established telecommunications infrastructure,"" says SKA's website. The array is going to be more than 50 times as powerful as the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which is currently the largest radio telescope on the planet."
