# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will go into details regarding algorithms that are combining
several models together, also called ensemble of models. We will present two
families of such technique: (i) based on bootstrapping and (ii) based
on boosting. We will present bagging and random forest that belong to the
former strategy and AdaBoost and gradient boosting decision tree that belong
to the later strategy. Finally, we will go into details regarding the
hyperparameters allowing to tune these models and compare them between models.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- know Python;
- having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy,
  Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn;
- basic understanding of predictive scikit-learn pipeline.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

The following links will help you to have an introduction to the above
required libraries:

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understanding the principles behind bootstrapping and boosting;
- get intuitions with specific models as random forest and gradient boosting;
- identify the important hyperparameters of random forest and gradient boosting
  decision trees as well as their typical values.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 4 hours.
