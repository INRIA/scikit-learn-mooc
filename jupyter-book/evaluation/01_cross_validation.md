# The cross-validation framework

In the previous notebooks, we show how to fit a machine-learning model. When we
evaluate our model's performance, we did not give details regarding the
evaluation framework that one should use in machine-learning. This notebook
presents the cross-validation framework and emphasizes the importance of
evaluating a model with such a framework.

Besides, we will show some good practices to follow, such as nested
cross-validation, when tuning model parameters.
