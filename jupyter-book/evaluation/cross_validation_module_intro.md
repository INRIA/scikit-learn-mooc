# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will go thoroughly into the cross-validation framework. Besides
presenting the general framework, we will also present simple baseline that
should be used when evaluating a predictive pipeline. Futhermore, we will give
more details on the cross-validation strategies to use depending on the type
of data that you are dealing with. Finally, we will give an example of nested
cross-validation that is necessary when one optimizes model parameters and
evaluate the same predictive model at once.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- know Python;
- having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy,
  Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn;
- basic understanding of predictive scikit-learn pipeline.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

The following links will help you to have an introduction to the above
required libraries:

- [Introduction to NumPy](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html);
- [Introduction to Matplotlib](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/index.html);

- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min);
- [Introduction to Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html).

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand the general cross-validation framework;
- understand the necessity of using an appropriate cross-validation strategy
  depending on the data;
- get the intuitions behind comparing a model with some basic models that
  can be used as baseline;
- understand the principle behind using nested cross-validation when the model
  needs to be evaluated as well as optimized.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 4 hours 10.
