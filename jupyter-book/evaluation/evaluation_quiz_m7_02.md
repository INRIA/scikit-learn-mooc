```{admonition} Question
We have a dataset with patient records from 10 different hospitals, and our goal
is to predict whether a patient has a disease or not. Let's also suppose that
the classes ("disease" and "no-disease") are imbalanced. Additionally, we suspect
that each hospital's data may have systematic biases due to factors like
medical devices, policies, socioeconomic status of the patients, etc.

Which cross-validation strategy is the most suitable for assessing the model's
ability to make good predictions on patients from hospitals not seen during
training?

- a) Group stratified k-fold cross-validation
- b) Group k-fold
- c) Stratified k-fold cross-validation
- d) Leave-one-out cross-validation
