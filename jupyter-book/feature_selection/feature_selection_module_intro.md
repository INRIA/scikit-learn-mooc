# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module gives some insights regarding feature selection. Besides motivating
the benefit of using feature selection, we also illustrate some of the known
caveats.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- know Python;
- having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy,
  Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn;
- basic understanding of predictive scikit-learn pipeline.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

The following links will help you to have an introduction to the above
required libraries:

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand in which case feature selection is beneficial;
- be aware of the caveats and how to put into practice feature selection
  techniques.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 50 minutes.
