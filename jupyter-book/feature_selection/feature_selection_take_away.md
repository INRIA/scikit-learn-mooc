# Main take away

In this chapter, we presented the principle of feature selection. In short,
feature selection is not a magical tool to get marginal gains. We tackle
the following aspects:

- you should use feature selection to speed-up training and testing rather
  than seeking for marginal performance gains;
- you should be careful regarding the framework and how to include a feature
  selector within your pipeline;
- you should be aware of the limitation of a feature selector based on
  machine-learning models.
