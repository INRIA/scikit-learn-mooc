The goal of this course is to teach machine learning with scikit-learn to
beginners, even without a strong technical background.
```

Predictive modeling brings value to a vast variety of data, in business
intelligence, health, industrial processes and scientific discoveries. It is a
pillar of modern data science. In this field, scikit-learn is a central tool:
it is easily accessible, yet powerful, and naturally dovetails in the wider
ecosystem of data-science tools based on the Python programming language.

This course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with
scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental
methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a
stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text
mining, or data science.

The course is more than a cookbook: it will teach you to be critical about each
step of the design of a predictive modeling pipeline: from choices in data
preprocessing, to choosing models, gaining insights on their failure modes and
interpreting their predictions.

## Prerequisites

The course aims to be accessible without a strong technical background. The
requirements for this course are:
- basic knowledge of Python programming : defining variables, writing
  functions, importing modules
- some prior experience with the NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib libraries is
  recommended but not required.

For a quick introduction on these requirements, you can go through these
[course materials](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
or use the following resources:
- [Introduction to Python](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/python_language.html)
- [Introduction to NumPy](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html)
- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- [Introduction to Matplotlib](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html#410-matplotlib)
