# Intro

## Course presentation

```{admonition} Welcome!
The goal of this course is to teach machine learning with scikit-learn to
beginners, even without a strong technical background.
```

Predictive modeling brings value to a vast variety of data, in business
intelligence, health, industrial processes... It is a pillar of modern
data science. In this field, scikit-learn is a central tool: it is easily
accessible and yet powerful, and it dovetails in a wider ecosystem of
data-science tools based on the Python programming language.

This course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with
scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons will give you the
fundamental tools and approaches of machine learning, and is as such a
stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence,
text mining, or data science.

The course covers the software tools to build and evaluate predictive
pipelines, as well as the related concepts and statistical intuitions. It
is more than a cookbook: it will teach you to understand and be critical
about each step, from choosing models to interpreting them.

## Prerequisites

The course is accessible without a strong technical background. The
requirements for this course are:
