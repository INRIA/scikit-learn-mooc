# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will present more in details models using a linear parametrization.
We will see how to use this family of models for both classification and
regression problems. Besides, we will present how to fight over-fitting using
regularization. Finally, we will show how linear models can be used with
complex data presenting non-linearity.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- know Python;
- having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy,
  Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn;
- basic understanding of predictive scikit-learn pipeline.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

The following links will help you to have an introduction to the above
required libraries:

- [Introduction to Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html).

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand the linear models parametrization;
- implication of linear models in both regression and classification;
- get intuitions of linear models applied in higher dimensional dataset;
- understand the effect of regularization on how to set it;
- understand how linear models can be used even with data showing non-linear
  relationship with the target to be predicted.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 4 hours.
