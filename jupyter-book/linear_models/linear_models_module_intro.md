# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will present more in details models using a linear parametrization.
We will see how to use this family of models for both classification and
regression problems. Besides, we will present how to fight over-fitting using
regularization. Finally, we will show how linear models can be used with
data presenting non-linearity.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- skills acquired during the "The Predictive Modeling Pipeline" module with
  basic usage of scikit-learn;
- skills acquired during the "Selecting The Best Model" module, mainly around
  the concept of underfit/overfit and the usage of cross-validation in
  scikit-learn.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand the linear models parametrization;
- implication of linear models in both regression and classification;
- get intuitions of linear models applied in higher dimensional dataset;
- understand the effect of regularization on how to set it;
- understand how linear models can be used even with data showing non-linear
  relationship with the target to be predicted.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 4 hours.
