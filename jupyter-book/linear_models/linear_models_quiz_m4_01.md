```{admonition} Question
What is a linear regression?

- a) a model that outputs a continuous prediction as the sum of the values of a
  **limited** subset of the input features
- b) a model that outputs a binary prediction based on a linear combination
  of the values of the input features
- c) a model that outputs a continuous prediction as a weighted sum of the input
  features
