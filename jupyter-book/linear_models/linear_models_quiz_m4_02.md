```{admonition} Question

Let us consider a pipeline that combines a polynomial feature extraction of
degree 2 and a linear regression model. Let us assume that the linear regression
coefficients are all non-zero and that the dataset contains a single feature.
Is the prediction function of this pipeline a straight line?

- a) yes
- b) no

Fitting a linear regression where `X` has `n_features` columns and the target
is a single continuous vector, what is the respective type/shape of `coef_`
and `intercept_`?

- b) array of shape (`n_features`,) and a float
- c) array of shape (1, `n_features`) and an array of shape (1,)
