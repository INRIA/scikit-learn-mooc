```{admonition} Question
Regularization allows:

- a) to create a model robust to outliers (samples that differ widely from
  other observations)
- b) to reduce overfitting by forcing the weights to stay close to zero
- c) to reduce underfitting by making the problem linearly separable

```{admonition} Question

```{admonition} Question
Assume that a data scientist has prepared a train/test split and plans to use
the test for the final evaluation of a `Ridge` model. The parameter `alpha` of
the `Ridge` model:

- a) is internally tuned when calling `fit` on the train set
- b) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **train set**
- c) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **test set**
- d) must be a positive number

```{admonition} Question
Scaling the data before fitting a model:

- a) is often useful for regularized linear models
- b) is always necessary for regularized linear models
- c) may speed-up fitting
- d) has no impact on the optimal choice of the value of a regularization parameter

```{admonition} Question
The effect of increasing the regularization strength in a ridge model is to:

- a) shrink all weights towards zero
- b) make all weights equal
- c) set a subset of the weights to exactly zero
- d) constrain all the weights to be positive

```{admonition} Question
By default, a [`LogisticRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) in scikit-learn applies:

- a) no penalty
- b) a penalty that shrinks the magnitude of the weights towards zero (also called "l2 penalty")
- c) a penalty that ensures all weights are equal

_Select a single answer_
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
The parameter `C` in a logistic regression is:

- a) similar to the parameter `alpha` in a ridge regressor
- b) similar to `1 / alpha` where `alpha` is the parameter of a ridge regressor
- c) not controlling the regularization

_Select a single answer_
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
In logistic regression, increasing the regularization strength (by
decreasing the value of `C`) makes the model:

- a) more likely to overfit to the training data
- b) more confident: the values returned by `predict_proba` are closer to 0 or 1
- c) less complex, potentially underfitting the training data
