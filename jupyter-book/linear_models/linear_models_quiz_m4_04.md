```{admonition} Question
Regularization allows:

- a) to create a model robust to outliers (samples that differ widely from
  other observations)
- b) to reduce overfitting by forcing the weights to stay close to zero
- c) to reduce underfitting by making the problem linearly separable

_Select a single answer_

```{admonition} Question
Assume that a data scientist has prepared a train/test split and plans to use
the test for the final evaluation of a `Ridge` model. The parameter `alpha` of
the `Ridge` model:

- a) is internally tuned when calling `fit` on the train set
- b) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **train set**
- c) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **test set**
- d) must be a positive number

Scaling the data before fitting a model:

- b) is always necessary for regularized linear models
- c) may speed-up fitting
- d) has no impact on the optimal choice of the value of a regularization parameter

```{admonition} Question
The effect of increasing the regularization strength in a ridge model is to:

- a) shrink all weights towards zero
- b) make all weights equal
- c) set a subset of the weights to exactly zero
