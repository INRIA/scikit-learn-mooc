```{admonition} Question
Regularization refers to:

- a) constraining the intercept of the linear model to be zero
- b) shrinking the weights of the linear model towards zero
- c) using a subset of the available data when fitting a linear model
```

```{admonition} Question
A ridge model is:

- a) the same as linear regression with penalized weights
- b) the same as logistic regression with penalized weights
- c) a linear model
- d) a non linear model
```

```{admonition} Question
Assume that a data scientist has prepared a train/test split and plans to use
the test for the final evaluation of a `Ridge` model. The parameter `alpha` of
the `Ridge` model:

- a) is internally tuned when calling `fit` on the train set
- b) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **train set**
- c) should be tuned by running cross-validation on a **test set**
- d) must be a positive number
```

```{admonition} Question
Scaling the data before fitting a model:

- a) is necessary when using a regularized model
- b) is always necessary
- c) may speed-up fitting
- d) has no impact on the regularization parameter
```

```{admonition} Question
The effect of an l2-regularization (as done in ridge) is to:

- a) shrink all weights towards zero
- b) make all weights equal
- c) set a subset of the weights to exactly zero
- d) constrain all the weights to be positive
```
