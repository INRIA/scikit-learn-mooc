# Main take away

In this chapter, we saw:

- a linear model as a specific parametrization defined by some weights and an
  intercept;
- linear models require to scale the data before to be trained;
- regularization allows to fight over-fitting;
- the regularization parameter needs to be fine tuned for each application;
- linear models can be used with data presenting non-linear links but require
  extra work such as the use of data augmentation or kernel trick.
