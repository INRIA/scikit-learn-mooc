# âœ… Quiz Intro.01

Given a case study: pricing apartments based on a real estate website. We have
thousands of house descriptions with their price. Typically, an example of a
house description is the following:

"Great for entertaining: spacious, updated 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in
Lakeview, 97630. The house will be available from May 1st. Close to nightlife
with private backyard. Price ~$1,000,000."

We are interested in predicting house prices from their description. One
potential use case for this would be, as a buyer, to find houses that are cheap
compared to their market value.
