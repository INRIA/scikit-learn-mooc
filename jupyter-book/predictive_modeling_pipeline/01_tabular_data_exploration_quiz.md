TODO ideas about things to add load this dataset from url.

- is this a regression or variable
- are the class balanced
- plot this versus this, which statement is true when this variable increases
  this other variable decreases
- what would be a simple rule to classify the data
- do you think machine learning could be useful in this context (dataset with
  simple obvious hand-crafted rule, dataset with random target, dataset with
  some pattern but are to tell)
- identify some problems with the data? 

Possible variations, play with `read_csv` arguments e.g. delimiter parameter?
