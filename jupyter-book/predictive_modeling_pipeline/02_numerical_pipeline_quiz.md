```{admonition} Question
Why do we need two sets: a train set and a test set?

- a) to train the model faster
- b) to gain insights of how to tune the hyper-parameters
- c) to validate the model on unseen data
```

```{admonition} Question
What is a numerical feature?

- a) a column containing values that can be used by a scikit-learn predictive
  model
- b) a column containing only numbers
- c) a column containing only numbers that are continuous
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
A scikit-learn model can be evaluated by:

- a) calling `fit` to train the model, `predict` to get the predictions, and
  compute the score using the predictions, the true values, and a metric
- b) calling `fit` to train the model, `score` to get the score
- c) calling `cross_validate` by providing the model and the data
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
When calling `cross_validate`, should you give at least:

- a) a scikit-learn model and the training data and target
- b) a scikit-learn model and the testing data and target
- c) a scikit-learn model and the full dataset
```

```{admonition} Question
Scaling the data before fitting a linear model allows us to:

- a) train the model faster
- b) achieve better performance
- c) none of the above
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
Cross-validation allows us to:

- a) train the model faster
- b) have better performance
- c) compute the error/score variability
- d) avoid over-fitting
```

+++

```{admonition} Question
`make_pipeline` (as well as `Pipeline`) is used for:

- a) run cross-validation
- b) combine one or several transformers and a predictor
- c) try several models at the same time
- d) avoid over-fitting
```
