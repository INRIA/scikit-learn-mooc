1. Why do we split the data into a training and a testing part ?

a) to train the model faster
b) to gain insight of how to tune the hyper-parameters
c) to validate the model on unseen data

2. scaling the data before fitting a linear model allows us to:

a) train the model faster
b) achieve better performance
c) none of the above


3. Cross validation allows us to:

a) train the model faster
b) have better performance
c) compute the error/score variability
d) avoid overfitting



4. `make_pipeline` is used for:

a) run cross validation
b) combine a scaler and a model
c) try severals model at the same time
d) avoid overfitting
