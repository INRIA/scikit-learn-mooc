# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will give an example of a typical predictive modeling pipeline
developed using tabular data.  
Note: Data is called tabular when it has a named column.  
We will present this pipeline in a progressive way.
First, we will make an analysis of the dataset used.
Subsequently, we will train our first pipeline with a subset of the dataset,
containing only numerical features.  
Finally, we will extend our pipeline to use mixed types of data, i.e. 
numerical and categorical data.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- basic knowledge of Python programming
- basic knowledge of NumPy and Pandas libraries

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

Here are a few good reference links about these requirements:

- [Introduction to NumPy](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html)
- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- build intuition regarding an unknown dataset;
- identify and differentiate numerical and categorical features;
- create an advanced predictive pipeline with scikit-learn.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 4 hours
