# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module gives an example of a typical predictive modeling pipeline
developed using tabular data. We will present this pipeline in a progressive
way. First, we will make an analysis of the dataset used. Then, we will train
our first pipeline with a subset of the dataset. Subsequently, we will
make our pipeline more complex to use all available type of data (i.e.
numerical and categorical data). Finally, we will show how to tune the pipeline
parameters.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- Know Python;
- Having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`,
  `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

- [Introduction to Python](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/python_language.html);
- [Introduction to NumPy](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html);
- [Introduction to Matplotlib](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/index.html);
- [Introduction to SciPy](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/scipy.html);
- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min);
- [Introduction to Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html).

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- Build intuition regarding an unknown dataset;
- Identify and differentiate numerical and categorical features;
- Create an advanced predictive pipeline with scikit-learn;
- Fine tune the parameters of an advanced predictive pipeline.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time go through this module is about 5 hours.
