# Main take-away

## Wrap-up

<!-- Quick wrap-up for the module -->

In this module, you learned:

- to create a scikit-learn predictive model;
- about the scikit-learn API to train and test a predictive model;
- to process numerical data, notably using a `Pipeline`.
- to process categorical data, notably using a `OneHotEncoder` and an
  `OrdinalEncoder`;
- to handle and process mixed data types (i.e. numerical and
  categorical data), notably using a `ColumnTransformer`.
