# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

This module will present in details decision tree models. This model will be
explained in both classification and regression problems. Besides, we will
show which hyperparameters of the decision tree have an importance on their
performance, allowing to find the best trade-off between under- and over-fit.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- skills acquired during the "The Predictive Modeling Pipeline" module with
  basic usage of scikit-learn;
- skills acquired during the "Selecting The Best Model" module, mainly around
  the concept of underfit/overfit and the usage of cross-validation in
  scikit-learn.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand how decision trees are working in classification and regression;
- check which tree parameters are important and their influences.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 2 hours 15.
