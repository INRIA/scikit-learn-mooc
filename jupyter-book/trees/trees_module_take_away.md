# Main take-away

## Wrap-up

<!-- Quick wrap-up for the module -->

In this module, we presented decision tree in details. We saw that decision
trees:

- are used in regression and classification problems;
- are non-parametric models;
- are not able to extrapolate;
- are sensible to hyperparameter tuning.
