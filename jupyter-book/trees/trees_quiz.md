1. How could we prevent overfitting within a tree model ?

a) with a weight regularization
b) by increasing max_depth
c) by decreasing max_depth
d) with early stopping


2. Tree are build:

a) incrementally by splitting leafs
b) by refining the rules of each nodes
c) by refining the prediction of each leaf


2. In a decision tree, to choose a split, we have to:

b) randomly choose a value
c) maximize an equation
d) maximize nb_features equations


3. In regression setting, what represent a leaf in a decision tree:

a) a value
b) a value distribution
c) a class
d) probabilities of each class


3. In classification setting, what represent a leaf in a decision tree:

a) a value
b) a value distribution
c) a class
d) probabilities of each class


4. Decision tree could be used for:

a) regression
b) classification
