# Manual tuning

The process of learning a predictive model is driven by a set of internal
parameters and a set of training data. These internal parameters are called
hyperparameters and are specific for each family of models. In addition, a
specific set of hyperparameters are optimal for a specific dataset and thus
they need to be optimized. In this notebook we will use the words
"hyperparameters" and "parameters" interchangeably.
