# Module overview

## What you will learn

<!-- Give in plain English what the module is about -->

In the previous modules, we show how to create, train, predict, and even
evaluate a predictive model. However, we did not change the hyperparameters
of a model.

In this module, we will first show that the hyperparameters have an impact on
the performance of the model and that default values are not necessarily the
best option. Subsequently, we will show how to set hyperparameters in
scikit-learn model. Finally, we will show strategies allowing to pick-up a
combination of hyperparameters that maximizes model's performance.

## Before getting started

<!-- Give the required skills for the module -->

The required technical skills to carry on this module are:

- know Python;
- having some basic knowledge of the following libraries: NumPy, SciPy,
  Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn;
- basic understanding of predictive scikit-learn pipeline.

<!-- Point to resources to learning these skills -->

The following links will help you to have an introduction to the above
required libraries:

## Objectives and time schedule

<!-- Give the learning objectives -->

The objective in the module are the following:

- understand what is a model hyperparameter;
- understand how to get and set the value an hyperparameter of a scikit-learn
  model;
- be able to fine tune a full predictive modeling pipeline;
- understand and visualize the combination of parameters that improves the
  performance of a model.

<!-- Give the investment in time -->

The estimated time to go through this module is about 2 hours.
