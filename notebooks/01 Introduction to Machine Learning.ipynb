    "Machine learning is the process of extracting knowledge from data automatically, usually with the goal of making predictions on new, unseen data. A classical example is a spam filter, for which the user keeps labeling incoming mails as either spam or not spam. A machine learning algorithm then \"learns\" a predictive model from data that distinguishes spam from normal emails, a model which can predict for new emails whether they are spam or not.   \n",

    "### Supervised Learning: Classification and regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Supervised Learning**, we have a dataset consisting of both input features and a desired output, such as in the spam / no-spam example.\n",
    "The task is to construct a model (or program) which is able to predict the desired output of an unseen object\n",
    "given the set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some more complicated examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a multicolor image of an object through a telescope, determine\n",
    "  whether that object is a star, a quasar, or a galaxy.\n",
    "- Given a photograph of a person, identify the person in the photo.\n",
    "- Given a list of movies a person has watched and their personal rating\n",
    "  of the movie, recommend a list of movies they would like.\n",
    "- Given a persons age, education and position, infer their salary\n",
    "\n",
    "What these tasks have in common is that there is one or more unknown\n",
    "quantities associated with the object which needs to be determined from other\n",
    "observed quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is further broken down into two categories, **classification** and **regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In classification, the label is discrete**, such as \"spam\" or \"no spam\". In other words, it provides a clear-cut distinction between categories. Furthermore, it is important to note that class labels are nominal, not ordinal variables. Nominal and ordinal variables are both subcategories of categorical variable. Ordinal variables imply an order, for example, T-shirt sizes \"XL > L > M > S\". On the contrary, nominal variables don't imply an order, for example, we (usually) can't assume \"orange > blue > green\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In regression, the label is continuous**, that is a float output. For example,\n",
    "in astronomy, the task of determining whether an object is a star, a galaxy, or a quasar is a\n",
    "classification problem: the label is from three distinct categories. On the other hand, we might\n",
    "wish to estimate the age of an object based on such observations: this would be a regression problem,\n",
    "because the label (age) is a continuous quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, there is always a distinction between a **training set** for which the desired outcome is given, and a **test set** for which the desired outcome needs to be inferred. The learning model fits the predictive model to the training set, and we use the test set to evaluate its generalization performance.\n"
