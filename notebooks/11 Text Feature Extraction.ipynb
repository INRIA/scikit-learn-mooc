    "tf-idfs are a way to represent documents as feature vectors. tf-idfs can be understood as a modification of the raw term frequencies (`tf`); the `tf` is the count of how often a particular word occurs in a given document. The concept behind the tf-idf is to downweight terms proportionally to the number of documents in which they occur. Here, the idea is that terms that occur in many different documents are likely unimportant or don't contain any useful information for Natural Language Processing tasks such as document classification. If you are interested in the mathematical details and equations, we have compiled an [external IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/machine_learning/scikit-learn/tfidf_scikit-learn.ipynb) that walks you through the computation."
