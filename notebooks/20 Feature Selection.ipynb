    "## Automatic Feature Selection\n",
    "Often we collected many features that might be related to a supervised prediction task, but we don't know which of them are actually predictive. To improve interpretability, and sometimes also generalization performance, we can use automatic feature selection to select a subset of the original features. There are several types of feature selection methods available, which we'll explain in order of increasing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given supervised model, the best feature selection strategy would be to try out each possible subset of the features, and evaluate generalization performance using this subset. However, there are exponentially many subsets of features, so this exhaustive search is generally infeasible. The strategies discussed below can be thought of as proxies for this infeasible computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Univariate statistics\n",
    "The simplest method to select features is using univariate statistics, that is by looking at each feature individually and running a statistical test to see whether it is related to the target. This kind of test is also known as analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n",
