One of the advantages of K-means is that it is extremely easy to implement, and it is also computationally very efficient compared to other clustering algorithms. However, we've seen that one of the weaknesses of K-Means is that it only works well if the data can be grouped into a globular or spherical shape. Also, we have to assign the number of clusters, *k*, *a priori* -- this can be a problem if we have no prior knowledge about how many clusters we expect to find. "
