    "\n",
    "Up to now, we have only focused on regression problems. There is a little\n",
    "difference between regression and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `base_estimator` should be chosen in line with the problem that\n",

    "with a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the aggregation method is different in regression and classification:\n",
    "- in regression, the average prediction is computed. For instance, if \n",

    "- while in classification, the class which highest probability\n",

    "three learners predict (for two classes) the probability (0.4, 0.6),\n",
    "(0.3, 0.7) and (0.31, 0.69), the aggregation probability is (0.33, 0.67)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in this section two algorithms that use bootstrap samples to create\n",
    "an ensemble of classifiers or regressors. These algorithms train several\n",
    "learners on different bootstrap samples. The predictions are then\n",
    "aggregated. This operation can be done in a very efficient manner since the\n",
    "training of each learner can be done in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that bagging builds an ensemble in a parallel manner: each learner\n",
    "is trained independently from each other. The idea behind boosting is\n",
    "different. The ensemble is a sequence of learners where the\n",
    "`Nth` learner requires all previous learners, from 1 to `N-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, bagging adds learners to the ensemble to correct the\n",
    "mistakes of the previous learners. We will start with an\n",
    "algorithm named Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to get some intuition about the\n",
    "main ideas behind boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)\n",

    "### Gradient-boosting decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "For gradient-boosting, parameters are coupled, so we can not anymore\n",

    "important parameters are `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `learning_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first discuss the `max_depth` parameter. We saw in the section on\n",
    "gradient-boosting that the algorithm fits the error of the previous tree\n",
    "in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees will be detrimental. Indeed,\n",
    "the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit (overfit) the data and\n",
    "thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there would be no residuals.\n",
    "Therefore, the tree used in gradient-boosting should have a low depth,\n",
    "typically between 3 to 8 levels.\n",
    "Having very weak learners at each step will help reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this consideration in mind, the deeper the trees, the faster the\n",
    "residuals will be corrected and less learners are required. So `n_estimators`\n",
    "should be increased if `max_depth` is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have overlooked the impact of the `learning_rate` parameter up\n",
    "till now. When\n",
    "fitting the residuals one could choose if the tree should try to correct all\n",
    "possible errors or only a fraction of them. The learning-rate allows you to\n",
    "control this behaviour. A small learning-rate value would only correct the\n",
    "residuals of very few samples. If a large learning-rate is set (e.g., 1),\n",
    "we would fit the residuals of all samples. So, with a very low\n",
    "learning-rate, we will need more estimators to correct the overall error.\n",
    "However, a too large learning-rate tends to obtain an overfitted ensemble,\n",
