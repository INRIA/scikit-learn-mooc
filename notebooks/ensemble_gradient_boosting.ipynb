    "\n",
    "Gradient-boosting differs from AdaBoost due to the following reason: instead\n",

    "the residuals error (hence the name \"gradient\") of the previous tree.\n",
    "Therefore, each new tree in the ensemble predicts the error made by the\n",
    "previous learner instead of predicting the target directly.\n",

    "In this section, we will provide some intuition about the way learners are\n",
