    "hyperparameter in random forests, controls the number of trees in the\n",
    "estimator. The difference is that the actual number of trees trained by the\n",
    "model is not entirely set by the user, but depends also on the stopping\n",
    "criteria: the number of trees can be lower than `max_iter` if adding a new\n",
    "tree does not improve the model enough. We will give more details on this in\n",
    "the next exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the trees is controlled by `max_depth` (or `max_leaf_nodes`). We\n",
    "saw in the section on gradient-boosting that boosting algorithms fit the error\n",
    "of the previous tree in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees would be\n",
    "detrimental. Indeed, the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit\n",
    "(overfit) the data and thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there\n",
