    "## Gradient-boosting decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "For gradient-boosting, parameters are coupled, so we cannot set the\n",
    "parameters one after the other anymore. The important parameters are\n",
    "`n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `learning_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first discuss the `max_depth` parameter.\n",
    "We saw in the section on gradient-boosting that the algorithm fits the error\n",
    "of the previous tree in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees will\n",
    "be detrimental.\n",
    "Indeed, the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit (overfit) the data\n",
    "and thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there would be no\n",
    "residuals.\n",
    "Therefore, the tree used in gradient-boosting should have a low depth,\n",
    "typically between 3 to 8 levels. Having very weak learners at each step will\n",
    "help reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this consideration in mind, the deeper the trees, the faster the\n",
    "residuals will be corrected and less learners are required. Therefore,\n",
    "`n_estimators` should be increased if `max_depth` is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have overlooked the impact of the `learning_rate` parameter\n",
    "until now. When fitting the residuals, we would like the tree\n",
    "to try to correct all possible errors or only a fraction of them.\n",
    "The learning-rate allows you to control this behaviour.\n",
    "A small learning-rate value would only correct the residuals of very few\n",
    "samples. If a large learning-rate is set (e.g., 1), we would fit the\n",
    "residuals of all samples. So, with a very low learning-rate, we will need\n",
    "more estimators to correct the overall error. However, a too large\n",
    "learning-rate tends to obtain an overfitted ensemble,\n",
    "similar to having a too large tree depth."
