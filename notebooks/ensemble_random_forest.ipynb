    "- `max_features=0.5` means that 50% of the features are considered at each\n",

    "However, `max_features` is one of the hyperparameters to consider when tuning\n",
    "a random forest:\n",
    "- too much randomness in the trees can lead to underfitted base models and\n",
    "  can be detrimental for the ensemble as a whole,\n",
    "- too few randomness in the trees leads to more correlation of the prediction\n",
    "  errors and as a result reduce the benefits of the averaging step in terms\n",
    "  of overfitting control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, the bagging classes also expose a `max_features` parameter.\n",
    "However, `BaggingClassifier` and `BaggingRegressor` are agnostic with respect\n",
    "to their base model and therefore random feature subsampling can only happen\n",
    "once before fitting each base model instead of several times per base model\n",
    "as is the case when adding splits to a given tree.\n",
