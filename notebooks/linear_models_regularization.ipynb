    "## Feature scaling and regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, weights define the association between feature values and the\n",
    "predicted target, which depends on the scales of both the feature values and\n",
    "the target. On the other hand, regularization adds constraints on the weights\n",
    "of the model through the `alpha` parameter. Therefore, the effect that feature\n",
    "rescaling has on the final weights also interacts with the use of\n",
    "regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the case where features live on the same scale/units: if two\n",
    "features are found to be equally important by the model, they are affected\n",
    "similarly by the regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the scenario where two features have completely different\n",
    "data scales (for instance age in years and annual revenue in dollars). Let's\n",
    "also assume that both features are approximately equally predictive and are\n",
    "not too correlated. Fitting a linear regression without scaling and without\n",
    "regularization would give a higher weight to the feature with the smallest\n",
    "natural scale. If we add regularization, the feature with the smallest natural\n",
    "scale would be penalized more than the other feature. This is not desirable\n",
    "given the hypothesis that both features are equally important. In such case we\n",
    "require the regularization to stay neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we don't know ahead of time which features are predictive, and\n",
    "therefore we want regularization to treat all features approximately equally\n",
    "by default. This can be achieved by rescaling the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, many numerical solvers used internally in scikit-learn behave\n",
    "better when features are approximately on the same scale. Heterogeneously\n",
    "scaled data can be detrimental when solving for the optimal weights (hence the\n",
    "warnings we tend to get when fitting linear models on raw data). Therefore,\n",
    "when working with a linear model and numerical data, it is generally a good\n",
    "practice to scale the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we add a `MinMaxScaler` in the machine learning pipeline, which scales\n",
    "each feature individually such that its range maps into the range between zero\n",
    "and one. We place it just before the `PolynomialFeatures` transformer as\n",
    "powers of features in the range between zero and one remain in the same range."
