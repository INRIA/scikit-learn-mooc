# # First look at our dataset
#
# In this notebook, we will look at the necessary steps required before any
#  machine learning takes place. It involves:
#
# * loading the data;
# * looking at the variables in the dataset, in particular, differentiate
#   between numerical and categorical variables, which need different
#   preprocessing in most machine learning workflows;
# * visualizing the distribution of the variables to gain some insights into
#   the dataset.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Loading the adult census dataset
#
# We will use data from the 1994 US census that we downloaded from
# [OpenML](http://openml.org/).
#
# You can look at the OpenML webpage to learn more about this dataset:
# <http://www.openml.org/d/1590>
#
# The dataset is available as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and we will
# use `pandas` to read it.
#
# ```{note}
# [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library used for
# manipulating 1 and 2 dimensional structured data. If you have never used
# pandas, we recommend you look at this
# [tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).
# ```

# %%
import pandas as pd

adult_census = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census.csv")

# %% [markdown]
# The goal with this data is to predict whether a person earns over 50K a year
# from heterogeneous data such as age, employment, education, family
# information, etc.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The variables (columns) in the dataset
#
# The data are stored in a `pandas` dataframe. A dataframe is a type of structured
# data composed of 2 dimensions. This type of data is also referred as tabular
# data.
#
# Each row represents a "sample". In the field of machine learning or
# descriptive statistics, commonly used equivalent terms are "record",
# "instance", or "observation".
#
# Each column represents a type of information that has been collected and is
# called a "feature". In the field of machine learning and descriptive
# statistics, commonly used equivalent terms are "variable", "attribute", or
# "covariate".

# %% [markdown]
# A quick way to inspect the dataframe is to show the first few lines with the
# `head` method:

# %%
adult_census.head()

# %% [markdown]
# The column named **class** is our target variable (i.e., the variable which
# we want to predict). The two possible classes are `<=50K` (low-revenue) and
# `>50K` (high-revenue). The resulting prediction problem is therefore a
# binary classification problem as `class` has only two possible values.
# We will use the left-over columns (any column other than `class`) as input
# variables for our model.

# %%
target_column = "class"
adult_census[target_column].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# Here, classes are slightly imbalanced, meaning there are more samples of one or
# more classes compared to others. In this case, we have many more samples with
# `" <=50K"` than with `" >50K"`. Class imbalance happens often in practice
# and may need special techniques when building a predictive model.
#
# For example in a medical setting, if we are trying to predict whether
# subjects will develop a rare disease, there will be a lot more healthy
# subjects than ill subjects in the dataset.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# The dataset contains both numerical and categorical data. Numerical values
# take continuous values, for example `"age"`. Categorical values can have a
# finite number of values, for example `"native-country"`.

# %%
numerical_columns = [
    "age",
    "education-num",
    "capital-gain",
    "capital-loss",
    "hours-per-week",
]
categorical_columns = [
    "workclass",
    "education",
    "marital-status",
    "occupation",
    "relationship",
    "race",
    "sex",
    "native-country",
]
all_columns = numerical_columns + categorical_columns + [target_column]

adult_census = adult_census[all_columns]

# %% [markdown]
# We can check the number of samples and the number of columns available in the
# dataset:

# %%
print(
    f"The dataset contains {adult_census.shape[0]} samples and "
    f"{adult_census.shape[1]} columns"
)

# %% [markdown]
# We can compute the number of features by counting the number of columns and
# subtract 1, since one of the columns is the target.

# %%
print(f"The dataset contains {adult_census.shape[1] - 1} features.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Visual inspection of the data
# Before building a predictive model, it is a good idea to look at the data:
#
# * maybe the task you are trying to achieve can be solved without machine
#   learning;
# * you need to check that the information you need for your task is actually
#   present in the dataset;
# * inspecting the data is a good way to find peculiarities. These can arise
#   during data collection (for example, malfunctioning sensor or missing
#   values), or from the way the data is processed afterwards (for example
#   capped values).

# %% [markdown]
# Let's look at the distribution of individual features, to get some insights
# about the data. We can start by plotting histograms, note that this only works
# for features containing numerical values:

# %%
_ = adult_census.hist(figsize=(20, 14))

# %% [markdown]
# ```{tip}
# In the previous cell, we used the following pattern: `_ = func()`. We do this
# to avoid showing the output of `func()` which in this case is not that
# useful. We actually assign the output of `func()` into the variable `_`
# (called underscore). By convention, in Python the underscore variable is used
# as a "garbage" variable to store results that we are not interested in.
# ```
#
# We can already make a few comments about some of the variables:
#
# * `"age"`: there are not that many points for `age > 70`. The dataset
#   description does indicate that retired people have been filtered out
#   (`hours-per-week > 0`);
# * `"education-num"`: peak at 10 and 13, hard to tell what it corresponds to
#   without looking much further. We'll do that later in this notebook;
# * `"hours-per-week"` peaks at 40, this was very likely the standard number of
#   working hours at the time of the data collection;
# * most values of `"capital-gain"` and `"capital-loss"` are close to zero.

# %% [markdown]
# For categorical variables, we can look at the distribution of values:

# %%
adult_census["sex"].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# Note that the data collection process resulted in an important imbalance
# between the number of male/female samples.
#
# Be aware that training a model with such data imbalance can cause
# disproportioned prediction errors for the under-represented groups. This is a
# typical cause of
# [fairness](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-fairness-ml#what-is-machine-learning-fairness)
# problems if used naively when deploying a machine learning based system in a
# real life setting.
#
# We recommend our readers to refer to [fairlearn.org](https://fairlearn.org)
# for resources on how to quantify and potentially mitigate fairness
# issues related to the deployment of automated decision making
# systems that rely on machine learning components.
#
# Studying why the data collection process of this dataset lead to such an
# unexpected gender imbalance is beyond the scope of this MOOC but we should
# keep in mind that this dataset is not representative of the US population
# before drawing any conclusions based on its statistics or the predictions of
# models trained on it.

# %%
adult_census["education"].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# As noted above, `"education-num"` distribution has two clear peaks around 10 and
# 13. It would be reasonable to expect that `"education-num"` is the number of
# years of education.
#
# Let's look at the relationship between `"education"` and `"education-num"`.
# %%
pd.crosstab(index=adult_census["education"], columns=adult_census["education-num"])

# %% [markdown]
# For every entry in `\"education\"`, there is only one single corresponding
# value in `\"education-num\"`. This shows that `"education"` and `"education-num"`
# give you the same information. For example, `"education-num"=2` is equivalent to
# `"education"="1st-4th"`. In practice that means we can remove
# `"education-num"` without losing information. Note that having redundant (or
# highly correlated) columns can be a problem for machine learning algorithms.

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# In the upcoming notebooks, we will only keep the `"education"` variable,
# excluding the `"education-num"` variable since the latter is redundant with
# the former.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# Another way to inspect the data is to do a `pairplot` and show how each
# variable differs according to our target, i.e. `"class"`. Plots along the
# diagonal show the distribution of individual variables for each `"class"`. The
# plots on the off-diagonal can reveal interesting interactions between
# variables.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

# We will plot a subset of the data to keep the plot readable and make the
# plotting faster
n_samples_to_plot = 5000
columns = ["age", "education-num", "hours-per-week"]
_ = sns.pairplot(
    data=adult_census[:n_samples_to_plot],
    vars=columns,
    hue=target_column,
    plot_kws={"alpha": 0.2},
    height=3,
    diag_kind="hist",
    diag_kws={"bins": 30},
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Creating decision rules by hand
#
# By looking at the previous plots, we could create some hand-written rules that
# predict whether someone has a high- or low-income. For instance, we could
# focus on the combination of the `"hours-per-week"` and `"age"` features.

# %%
_ = sns.scatterplot(
    x="age",
    y="hours-per-week",
    data=adult_census[:n_samples_to_plot],
    hue=target_column,
    alpha=0.5,
)

# %% [markdown]
# The data points (circles) show the distribution of `"hours-per-week"` and
# `"age"` in the dataset. Blue points mean low-income and orange points mean
# high-income. This part of the plot is the same as the bottom-left plot in the
# pairplot above.
#
# In this plot, we can try to find regions that mainly contains a single class
# such that we can easily decide what class one should predict. We could come up
# with hand-written rules as shown in this plot:

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ax = sns.scatterplot(
    x="age",
    y="hours-per-week",
    data=adult_census[:n_samples_to_plot],
    hue=target_column,
    alpha=0.5,
)

age_limit = 27
plt.axvline(x=age_limit, ymin=0, ymax=1, color="black", linestyle="--")

hours_per_week_limit = 40
plt.axhline(y=hours_per_week_limit, xmin=0.18, xmax=1, color="black", linestyle="--")

plt.annotate("<=50K", (17, 25), rotation=90, fontsize=35)
plt.annotate("<=50K", (35, 20), fontsize=35)
_ = plt.annotate("???", (45, 60), fontsize=35)

# %% [markdown]
# * In the region `age < 27` (left region) the prediction is low-income. Indeed,
#   there are many blue points and we cannot see any orange points.
# * In the region `age > 27 AND hours-per-week < 40` (bottom-right region), the
#   prediction is low-income. Indeed, there are many blue points and only a few
#   orange points.
# * In the region `age > 27 AND hours-per-week > 40` (top-right region), we see
#   a mix of blue points and orange points. It seems complicated to choose which
#   class we should predict in this region.
#
# It is interesting to note that some machine learning models will work
# similarly to what we did: they are known as decision tree models. The two
# thresholds that we chose (27 years and 40 hours) are somewhat arbitrary, i.e.
# we chose them by only looking at the pairplot. In contrast, a decision tree
# will choose the "best" splits based on data without human intervention or
# inspection. Decision trees will be covered more in detail in a future module.
#
# Note that machine learning is often used when creating rules by hand
# is not straightforward. For example because we are in high dimension (many
# features in a table) or because there are no simple and obvious rules that
# separate the two classes as in the top-right region of the previous plot.
#
# To sum up, the important thing to remember is that in a machine-learning
# setting, a model automatically creates the "rules" from the existing data in
# order to make predictions on new unseen data.

# ## Notebook Recap
#
# In this notebook we:
#
# * loaded the data from a CSV file using `pandas`;
# * looked at the different kind of variables to differentiate between
#   categorical and numerical variables;
# * inspected the data with `pandas` and `seaborn`. Data inspection can allow
#   you to decide whether using machine learning is appropriate for your data
#   and to highlight potential peculiarities in your data.
#
# We made important observations (which will be discussed later in more detail):
#
# * if your target variable is imbalanced (e.g., you have more samples from one
#   target category than another), you may need special techniques for training
#   and evaluating your machine learning model;
# * having redundant (or highly correlated) columns can be a problem for some
#   machine learning algorithms;
# * contrary to decision tree, linear models can only capture linear
#   interactions, so be aware of non-linear relationships in your data.
