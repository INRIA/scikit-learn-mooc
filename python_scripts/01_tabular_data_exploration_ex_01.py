# # 📝 Exercise 01

# %% [markdown]
# We will try to predict penguins species based on two of their body
# measurements: culmen length and culmen depth.
# 
# What are the features? What is the target?

# %% [markdown]
# The data is located in `../datasets/penguins_classification.csv`, load it
# with `pandas` into a `DataFrame`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Show a few samples of the data

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# How many samples of each species do you have?

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Plot histograms for the numerical features

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Show features distribution for each class. Looking at this distributions, how
# hard do you think it will be to classify the penguins only using "culmen
# depth" and "culmen length"?

# %%
# Write your code here.
