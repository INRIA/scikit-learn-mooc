# %% [markdown]
# Imagine we are interested in predicting penguins species based on two of their
# body measurements: culmen length and culmen depth. First we want to do some
# data exploration to get a feel for the data.
#
# What are the features? What is the target?

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# The features are `"culmen length"` and `"culmen depth"`. The target is the
# penguin species.

# %% [markdown]
# The data is located in `../datasets/penguins_classification.csv`, load it with
# `pandas` into a `DataFrame`.

# %%
# solution
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_classification.csv")

# %% [markdown]
# Show a few samples of the data.
#
# How many features are numerical? How many features are categorical?

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# Both features, `"culmen length"` and `"culmen depth"` are numerical. There are
# no categorical features in this dataset.

# %%
# solution
penguins.head()

# %% [markdown]
# What are the different penguins species available in the dataset and how many
# samples of each species are there? Hint: select the right column and use the
# [`value_counts`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html)
# method.

# %%
# solution
penguins["Species"].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# Plot histograms for the numerical features

# %%
# solution
_ = penguins.hist(figsize=(8, 4))

# %% [markdown]
# Show features distribution for each class. Hint: use
# [`seaborn.pairplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html)

# %%
# solution
import seaborn

pairplot_figure = seaborn.pairplot(penguins, hue="Species")

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# We observe that the labels on the axis are overlapping. Even if it is not the
# priority of this notebook, one can tweak them by increasing the height of each
# subfigure.

# %% tags=["solution"]
pairplot_figure = seaborn.pairplot(penguins, hue="Species", height=4)

# %% [markdown]
# Looking at these distributions, how hard do you think it will be to classify
# the penguins only using `"culmen depth"` and `"culmen length"`?

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# Looking at the previous scatter-plot showing `"culmen length"` and `"culmen
# depth"`, the species are reasonably well separated:
# - low culmen length -> Adelie
# - low culmen depth -> Gentoo
# - high culmen depth and high culmen length -> Chinstrap
#
# There is some small overlap between the species, so we can expect a
# statistical model to perform well on this dataset but not perfectly.
