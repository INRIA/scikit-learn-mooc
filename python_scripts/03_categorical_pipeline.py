# # Encoding of categorical variables
#
# In this notebook, we will present typical ways of dealing with
# **categorical variables** by encoding them, namely **ordinal encoding** and
# **one-hot encoding**.

# %% [markdown]
# Let's first load the entire adult dataset containing both numerical and
# categorical data.

# %%
import pandas as pd

adult_census = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census.csv")

target_name = "class"
target = adult_census[target_name]

data = adult_census.drop(columns=[target_name, "fnlwgt"])

# %% [markdown]
# ```{caution}
# Here and later, we use the name `data` and `target` to be explicit. In
# scikit-learn, documentation `data` is commonly named `X` and `target` is
# commonly called `y`.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Identify categorical variables
#
# As we saw in the previous section, a numerical variable is a
# quantity represented by a real or integer number. These variables can be
# naturally handled by machine learning algorithms that are typically composed
# of a sequence of arithmetic instructions such as additions and
# multiplications.
#
# In contrast, categorical variables have discrete values, typically
# represented by string labels (but not only) taken from a finite list of
# possible choices. For instance, the variable `native-country` in our dataset
# is a categorical variable because it encodes the data using a finite list of
# possible countries (along with the `?` symbol when this information is
# missing):

# %%
data["native-country"].value_counts().sort_index()

# %% [markdown]
# How can we easily recognize categorical columns among the dataset? Part of
# the answer lies in the columns' data type:

# %%
data.dtypes

# %% [markdown]
# If we look at the `"native-country"` column, we observe its data type is
# `object`, meaning it contains string values.
#
# Sometimes, categorical columns could also be encoded with integers. In such
# case, looking at the data type will not be enough. In a previous notebook,
# we saw it is the case with the column `"education-num"`.

# %%
data["education-num"].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# When considering categorical columns, we should include these columns.
# However, we also saw earlier that `"education-num"` and `"education"`
# represent the exact same information. Therefore, we can get rid of one of the
# two. Because in this notebook we will use `"education"` because it represents
# the original data.
#
# ## Select features based on their data type
#
# In the previous notebook, we manually defined the numerical columns. We could
# do a similar approach. Instead, we will use the scikit-learn helper function
# `make_column_selector`, which allows us to select columns based on
# their data type. We will illustrate how to use this helper.

# %%
from sklearn.compose import make_column_selector as selector

categorical_columns_selector = selector(dtype_include=object)
categorical_columns = categorical_columns_selector(data)
categorical_columns

# %% [markdown]
# Here, we created the selector by passing the data type to include; we then
# passed the input dataset to the selector object, which returned a list of
# column names that have the requested data type. We can now filter out the
# unwanted columns:

# %%
data_categorical = data[categorical_columns]
data_categorical.head()

# %%
print(f"The dataset is composed of {data_categorical.shape[1]} features")

# %% [markdown]
# In the remainder of this section, we will present different strategies to
# encode categorical data into numerical data which can be used by a
# machine-learning algorithm.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Encoding ordinal categories
#
# The most intuitive strategy is to encode each category with a different
# number. The `OrdinalEncoder` will transform the data in such manner.
# We will start by encoding a single column to understand how the encoding
# works.

# %%
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

education_column = data_categorical[["education"]]

encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
education_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(education_column)
education_encoded

# %% [markdown]
# We see that each category in `"education"` has been replaced by a numeric
# value. We could check the mapping between the categories and the numerical
# values by checking the fitted attribute `categories_`.

# %%
encoder.categories_

# %% [markdown]
#  Now, we can check the encoding applied on all categorical features.

# %%
data_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(data_categorical)
data_encoded[:5]

# %%
encoder.categories_

# %%
print(
    f"The dataset encoded contains {data_encoded.shape[1]} features")

# %% [markdown]
# We see that the categories have been encoded for each feature (column)
# independently. We also note that the number of features before and after the
# encoding is the same.
#
# ```{tip}
# This encoding was used by the dataset's publishers on the `"education"`
# feature, which gave the feature `"education-num"`.
# ```
#
# However, be careful when applying this encoding strategy:
# using this integer representation lead downstream predictive models
# to assume that the values are ordered (0 < 1 < 2 < 3... for instance).
#
# By default, `OrdinalEncoder` uses a lexicographical strategy to map string
# category labels to integers. This strategy is arbitrary and often
# meaningless. For instance, suppose the dataset has a categorical variable
# named `"size"` with categories such as "S", "M", "L", "XL". We would like the
# integer representation to respect the meaning of the sizes by mapping them to
# increasing integers such as `0, 1, 2, 3`.
# However, the lexicographical strategy used by default would map the labels
# "S", "M", "L", "XL" to 2, 1, 0, 3, by following the alphabetical order.
#
# The `OrdinalEncoder` class accepts a `categories` constructor argument to
# pass categories in the expected ordering explicitly.
#
# If a categorical variable does not carry any meaningful order information
# then this encoding might be misleading to downstream statistical models and
# you might consider using one-hot encoding instead (see below).
#
# ```{important}
# Note however that the impact of violating this ordering assumption is really
# dependent on the downstream models. For instance, linear models will be
# impacted by misordered categories while decision trees model will not be.
# ```
#
# ## Encoding nominal categories (without assuming any order)
#
# `OneHotEncoder` is an alternative encoder that prevent the dowstream
# models to make a false assumption about the ordering of categories. For a
# given feature, it will create as many new columns as there are possible
# categories. For a given sample, the value of the column corresponding to the
# category will be set to `1` while all the columns of the other categories
# will be set to `0`.
#
# We will start by encoding a single feature (e.g. `"education"`) to illustrate
# how the encoding works.
#
# ```{note}
# We will pass the argument `sparse=False` to the `OneHotEncoder` which will
# avoid obtaining a sparse matrix, which is less efficient but easier to
# inspect results for didactic purposes.
# ```

# %%
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
education_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(education_column)
education_encoded

# %% [markdown]
# We see that encoding a single feature will give a NumPy array full of zeros
# and ones. We can get a better understanding using the associated feature
# names resulting from the transformation.

# %%
feature_names = encoder.get_feature_names(input_features=["education"])
education_encoded = pd.DataFrame(education_encoded, columns=feature_names)
education_encoded

# %% [markdown]
# As we can see, each category (unique value) became a column; the encoding
# returned, for each sample, a 1 to specify which category it belongs to.
#
# Let's apply this encoding on the full dataset.

# %%
print(
    f"The dataset is composed of {data_categorical.shape[1]} features")
data_categorical.head()

# %%
data_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(data_categorical)
data_encoded[:5]

# %%
print(
    f"The dataset encoded contains {data_encoded.shape[1]} features")

# %% [markdown]
# Let's wrap this NumPy array in a dataframe with informative column names as
# provided by the encoder object:

# %%
columns_encoded = encoder.get_feature_names(data_categorical.columns)
pd.DataFrame(data_encoded, columns=columns_encoded).head()

# %% [markdown]
# Look at how the "workclass" variable of the 3 first records has been encoded
# and compare this to the original string representation.
#
# The number of features after the encoding is more than 10 times larger than
# in the original data because some variables such as `occupation` and
# `native-country` have many possible categories.
#
# ## Evaluate our predictive pipeline
#
# We can now integrate this encoder inside a machine learning pipeline like we
# did with numerical data: let's train a linear classifier on the encoded data
# and check the performance of this machine learning pipeline using
# cross-validation.
#
# Before we create the pipeline, we have to linger on the `native-country`.
# Let's recall some statistics regarding this column.

# %%
data["native-country"].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# We see that the `Holand-Netherlands` category is occuring rarely. This will
# be a problem during cross-validation: if the sample ends up in the test set
# during splitting then the classifier would not have seen the category during
# training and will not be able to encode it.
#
# In scikit-learn, there is two solutions to bypass this issue:
#
# * list all the possible categories and provide it to the encoder via the
#   keyword argument `categories`;
# * set the parameter `handle_unknown="ignore"`.
#
# Here, we will use the former strategy because we are also going to use it for
# the ordinal encoder later on.

# %%
categories = [data_categorical[column].unique()
              for column in data_categorical]

# %% [markdown]
# We can now create our machine learning pipeline.

# %%
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = make_pipeline(
    OneHotEncoder(categories=categories, drop="if_binary"),
    LogisticRegression(max_iter=500))

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# Here, we need to increase the number of maximum iteration to obtain a fully
# converged `LogisticRegression` and silence a `ConvergenceWarning`. In the
# contrary to numerical features, the one-hot encoded categorical feature do
# not suffer from large variations and therefore increasing `max_iter` is the
# right thing to do.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we can check the model's performance only using the categorical
# columns.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
cv_results = cross_validate(model, data_categorical, target)
cv_results

# %%
scores = cv_results["test_score"]
print(f"The accuracy is: {scores.mean():.3f} +/- {scores.std():.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# As you can see, this representation of the categorical variables is
# slightly more predictive of the revenue than the numerical variables
# that we used previously.

# %% [markdown]
#
# In this notebook we have:
# * seen two common strategies for encoding categorical features: **ordinal
#   encoding** and **one-hot encoding**;
# * used a **pipeline** to use a **one-hot encoder** before fitting a logistic
#   regression.
