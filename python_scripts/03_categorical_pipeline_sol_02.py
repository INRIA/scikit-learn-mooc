# # Solution for Exercise 02
#
# The goal of this exercise is to evaluate the impact of feature preprocessing on a pipeline that uses a  decision-tree-based classifier instead of logistic regression.
#
# - The first question is to empirically evaluate whether scaling numerical feature is helpful or not;
#
# - The second question is to evaluate whether it is empirically better (both from a computational and a statistical perspective) to use integer coded or one-hot encoded categories.
#
#
# Hint: `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` does not yet support sparse input data. You might want to use
# `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore", sparse=False)` to force the use a dense representation as a workaround.

#
# First let's time the pipeline we used in the main notebook to serve as a reference:

# %%
# %%time

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('categorical', OrdinalEncoder(categories=categories),
     categorical_columns),], remainder="passthrough")

model = make_pipeline(preprocessor, HistGradientBoostingClassifier())
scores = cross_val_score(model, data, target)
print(f"The different scores obtained are: \n{scores}")
print(f"The accuracy is: {scores.mean():.3f} +- {scores.std():.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Scaling numerical features

# %%
# %%time
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('numerical', StandardScaler(), numerical_columns),
    ('categorical', OrdinalEncoder(categories=categories),
     categorical_columns),])

model = make_pipeline(preprocessor, HistGradientBoostingClassifier())
scores = cross_val_score(model, data, target)
print(f"The different scores obtained are: \n{scores}")
print(f"The accuracy is: {scores.mean():.3f} +- {scores.std():.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Analysis
#
# We can observe that both the accuracy and the training time are approximately the same as the reference pipeline (any time difference you might observe is not significant).
#
# Scaling numerical features is indeed useless for most decision tree models in general and for `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` in particular.

# ## One-hot encoding of categorical variables
#
# For linear models, we have observed that integer coding of categorical
# variables can be very detrimental. However for
# `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` models, it does not seem to be the
# case as the cross-validation of the reference pipeline with
# `OrdinalEncoder` is good.
#
# Let's see if we can get an even better accuracy with `OneHotEncoding`:

# %%
# %%time
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('categorical',
     OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore", sparse=False),
     categorical_columns),], remainder="passthrough")

model = make_pipeline(preprocessor, HistGradientBoostingClassifier())
scores = cross_val_score(model, data, target)
print(f"The different scores obtained are: \n{scores}")
print(f"The accuracy is: {scores.mean():.3f} +- {scores.std():.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Analysis
#
# From an accuracy point of view, the result is almost exactly the same.
# The reason is that `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is expressive
# and robust enough to deal with misleading ordering of integer coded
# categories (which was not the case for linear models).
#
# However from a computation point of view, the training time is
# significantly longer: this is caused by the fact that `OneHotEncoder`
# generates approximately 10 times more features than `OrdinalEncoder`.
#
# Note that the current implementation `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`
# is still incomplete, and once sparse representation are handled
# correctly, training time might improve with such kinds of encodings.
#
# The main take away message is that arbitrary integer coding of
# categories is perfectly fine for `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`
# and yields fast training times.
