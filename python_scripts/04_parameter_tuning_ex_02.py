# # Exercise 02
#
# The goal is to find the best set of hyper-parameters which maximize the
# performance on a training set.
#
# Here again with limit the size of the training set to make computation
# run faster. Feel free to increase the `train_size` value if your computer
# is powerful enough.

# TODO: create your machine learning pipeline
#
# You should:
# * preprocess the categorical columns using a `OneHotEncoder` and use a
#   `StandardScaler` to normalize the numerical data.
# * use a `LogisticRegression` as a predictive model.

# %% [markdown]
# Start by defining the columns and the preprocessing pipelines to be applied
# on each columns.
# %%

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# %% [markdown]
# Subsequently, create a `ColumnTransformer` to redirect the specific columns
# a preprocessing pipeline.
# %%

from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, concatenate the preprocessing pipeline with a logistic regression.
# %%

from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression


# %% [markdown]
# TODO: make your random search
#
# Use a `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the best set of hyper-parameters by tuning
# the following parameters for the `LogisticRegression` model:
# - `C` with values ranging from 0.001 to 10. You can use a reciprocal
#   distribution (i.e. `scipy.stats.reciprocal`);
# - `solver` with possible values being `"liblinear"` and `"lbfgs"`;
# - `penalty` with possible values being `"l2"` and `"l1"`;
#
# In addition, try several preprocessing strategies with the `OneHotEncoder`
# by always (or not) dropping the first column when encoding the categorical
# data.
#
# Notes: some combinations of the hyper-parameters proposed above are invalid.
# You can make the parameter search accept such failures by setting `error_score`
# to `np.nan`. The warning messages give more details on which parameter
# combinations but the computation will proceed.
#
# Once the computation has completed, print the best combination of parameters
# stored in the `best_params_` attribute.
