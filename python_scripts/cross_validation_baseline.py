# # Comparing model performance with a simple baseline
#
# In this notebook, we present how to compare the generalization performance of
# a model to a minimal baseline. In regression, we can use the `DummyRegressor`
# class to predict the mean target value observed on the training set without
# using the input features.
#
# We now demonstrate how to compute the score of a regression model and then
# compare it to such a baseline on the California housing dataset.

# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# section named "Appendix - Datasets description" at the end of this MOOC.

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

data, target = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
target *= 100  # rescale the target in k$

# Across all evaluations, we will use a `ShuffleSplit` cross-validation
# splitter with 20% of the data held on the validation side of the split.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit

cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=30, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# %% [markdown]
# We start by running the cross-validation for a simple decision tree regressor
# which is our model of interest. Besides, we will store the testing error in a
# pandas series to make it easier to plot the results.

# Then, we evaluate our baseline. This baseline is called a dummy regressor.
# This dummy regressor will always predict the mean target computed on the
# training target variable. Therefore, the dummy regressor does not use any
# information from the input features stored in the dataframe named `data`.

# %% [markdown]
# We see that the generalization performance of our decision tree is far from
# being perfect: the price predictions are off by more than 45,000 US dollars
# on average. However it is much better than the mean price baseline. So this
# confirms that it is possible to predict the housing price much better by
# using a model that takes into account the values of the input features
# (housing location, size, neighborhood income...). Such a model makes more
# informed predictions and approximately divides the error rate by a factor of 2
# compared to the baseline that ignores the input features.
#
# Note that here we used the mean price as the baseline prediction. We could
# have used the median instead. See the online documentation of the
# [sklearn.dummy.DummyRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyRegressor.html)
# class for other options. For this particular example, using the mean instead
# of the median does not make much of a difference but this could have been the
# case for dataset with extreme outliers.
