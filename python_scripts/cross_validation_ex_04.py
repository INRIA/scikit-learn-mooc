# # üìù Introductory exercise for sample grouping
#
# This exercise aims at highlighting issues that one could encounter when
# discarding grouping pattern existing in a dataset.
#
# We will use the digits dataset which includes some grouping pattern.

from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

data, target = load_digits(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)

# The first step is to create a model. Use a machine learning pipeline
# composed of a scaler followed by a logistic regression classifier.

# Then, create a a `KFold` object making sure that the data will not be
# shuffled during the cross-validation. Use the previous model, data, and
# cross-validation strategy defined to estimate the generalization performance of
# the model.
