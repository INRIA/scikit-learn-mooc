# # üìù Introductory exercise for non i.i.d. data
#
# This exercise aims at showing some aspects to consider when dealing with non
# i.i.d data, typically time series.
#
# For this purpose, we will create a synthetic dataset simulating stock values.
# We will formulate the following data science problem: predict the value of a
# specific stock given other stock.
#
# To make this problem interesting, we want to ensure that any predictive model
# should **not** work. In this regard, the stocks will be generated completely
# randomly without any link between them. We will only add a constraint: the
# value of a stock at a given time `t` will depend on the value of the stock
# from the past.
#
# We will create a function to generate such data.

# Now that we have our data generator, let's create three quotes, corresponding
# to the quotes of three different companies for instance. We will plot

# Because the stocks are generated randomly, there is no possibility for a
# predictive model to be able to predict the value of a stock depending on the
# other stocks. By using the cross-validation framework from the previous
# exercise, we will check that we get such expected results.
#
# First, let's organise our data into a matrix `X` and a target `y`. Split
# the data such that the `Stock 0` is the stock that we want to predict and
# the `Stock 1` and `Stock 2` are stocks used to build our model.

# Let's create a machine learning model. We can use a
# `GradientBoostingRegressor`.

# Write your code here.

# Now, we have to define a cross-validation strategy to evaluate our model.
# Use a `ShuffleSplit` cross-validation.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# We should be set to make our evaluation. Call the function `cross_val_score`
# to compute the $R^2$ score for the different split and report the mean
# and standard deviation of the model.

# Write your code here.

# Your model is not giving random predictions. Could you ellaborate on what
# are the reasons of such a success on random data.
