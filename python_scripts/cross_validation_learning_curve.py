# # Effect of the sample size in cross-validation
#
# In the previous notebook, we presented the general cross-validation framework
# and how to assess if a predictive model is underfiting, overfitting, or
# generalizing. Besides these aspects, it is also important to understand how
# the different errors are influenced by the number of samples available.
#
# In this notebook, we will show this aspect by looking a the variability of
# the different errors.
#
# Let's first load the data and create the same model as in the previous
# notebook.

# ## Learning curve
#
# To understand the impact of the number of samples available for training on
# the statistical performance of a predictive model, it is possible to
# synthetically reduce the number of samples used to train the predictive model
# and check the training and testing errors.
#
# Therefore, we can vary the number of samples in the training set and repeat
# the experiment. The training and testing scores can be plotted similarly to
# the validation curve, but instead of varying an hyperparameter, we vary the
# number of training samples. This curve is called the **learning curve**.
#
# It gives information regarding the benefit of adding new training samples
# to improve a model's statistical performance.
#
# Let's compute the the learning curve for a decision tree and vary the
# proportion of the training set from 10% to 100%.

from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit

cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=30, test_size=0.2)

# Now, we are all set to carry out the experiment.

    regressor, data, target, train_sizes=train_sizes, cv=cv,
    scoring="neg_mean_absolute_error", n_jobs=2)
train_size, train_scores, test_scores = results[:3]
# Convert the scores into errors
train_errors, test_errors = -train_scores, -test_scores

# %% [markdown]
# Now, we can plot the curve curve.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.errorbar(train_size, train_errors.mean(axis=1),
             yerr=train_errors.std(axis=1), label="Training error")
plt.errorbar(train_size, test_errors.mean(axis=1),
             yerr=test_errors.std(axis=1), label="Testing error")
plt.legend()

plt.xscale("log")
plt.xlabel("Number of samples in the training set")
plt.ylabel("Mean absolute error (k$)")
_ = plt.title("Learning curve for decision tree")

# We see that the more samples we add to the training set on this learning
# curve, the lower the error becomes. With this curve, we are searching for the
# plateau for which there is no benefit to adding samples anymore or assessing
# the potential gain of adding more samples into the training set.
#
# For this dataset we notice that our decision tree model would really benefit
# from additional datapoints to reduce the amount of over-fitting and hopefully
# reduce the testing error even further.
#
# ## Summary
#
# In the notebook, we learnt:
#
# * the influence of the number of samples in a dataset, especially on the
#   variability of the errors reported when running the cross-validation;
# * about the learning curve that is a visual representation of the capacity
#   of a model to improve by adding new samples.
