# # Nested cross-validation
#
# Cross-validation can be used both for hyperparameter tuning and for
# estimating the generalization performance of a model. However, using
# it for both purposes at the same time is problematic, as the resulting
# evaluation can underestimate some overfitting that results from
# the hyperparameter tuning procedure itself.
#
# Philosophically, hyperparameter tuning is a form of machine learning
# itself and therefore, we need another outer loop of cross-validation to
# properly evaluate the generalization performance of the full modeling
# procedure.
#
# This notebook highlights nested cross-validation and its impact on the
# estimated generalization performance compared to naively using a single level
# of cross-validation, both for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation of the
# generalization performance.
#
# We will illustrate this difference using the breast cancer dataset.

# %%
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

data, target = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)

# First, we use `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters via cross-validation
# on a minimal parameter grid.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC

param_grid = {"C": [0.1, 1, 10], "gamma": [.01, .1]}
model_to_tune = SVC()

search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=model_to_tune, param_grid=param_grid, n_jobs=2
)
search.fit(data, target)

# %% [markdown]
# We recall that, internally, `GridSearchCV` trains several models for each on
# sub-sampled training sets and evaluate each of them on the matching testing
# sets using cross-validation. This evaluation procedure is controlled via
# using the `cv` parameter. The procedure is then repeated for all possible
# combinations of parameters given in `param_grid`.
#
# The attribute `best_params_` gives us the best set of parameters that
# maximize the mean score on the internal test sets.

# %%
print(f"The best parameters found are: {search.best_params_}")

# %% [markdown]
# We can also show the mean score obtained by using the parameters `best_params_`.

# %%
print(f"The mean CV score of the best model is: {search.best_score_:.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# At this stage, one should be extremely careful using this score. The
# misinterpretation would be the following: since this mean score was computed
# using cross-validation test sets, we could use it to assess the
# generalization performance of the model trained with the best
# hyper-parameters.
#
# However, we should not forget that we used this score to pick-up the best
# model. It means that we used knowledge from the test sets (i.e. test scores)
# to select the hyper-parameter of the model it-self.
#
# Thus, this mean score is not a fair estimate of our testing error. Indeed, it
# can be too optimistic, in particular when running a parameter search on a
# large grid with many hyper-parameters and many possible values per
# hyper-parameter. A way to avoid this pitfall is to use a "nested"
# cross-validation.
#
# In the following, we will use an inner cross-validation corresponding to the
# previous procedure above to only optimize the hyperparameters. We will also
# embed this tuning procedure within an outer cross-validation, which is
# dedicated to estimate the testing error of our tuned model.
#
# In this case, our inner cross-validation always gets the training set of the
# outer cross-validation, making it possible to always compute the final
# testing scores on completely independent sets of samples.
#
# Let us do this in one go as follows:

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold

# Declare the inner and outer cross-validation strategies
inner_cv = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=0)
outer_cv = KFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=0)

# Inner cross-validation for parameter search
model = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=model_to_tune, param_grid=param_grid, cv=inner_cv, n_jobs=2
)

# Outer cross-validation to compute the testing score
test_score = cross_val_score(model, data, target, cv=outer_cv, n_jobs=2)
print(f"The mean score using nested cross-validation is: "
      f"{test_score.mean():.3f} Â± {test_score.std():.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# The reported score is more trustworthy and should be close to production's
# expected generalization performance. Note that in this case, the two score
# values are very close for this first trial.
#
# We would like to better assess the difference between the nested and
# non-nested cross-validation scores to show that the latter can be too
# optimistic in practice. To do this, we repeat the experiment several times
# and shuffle the data differently to ensure that our conclusion does not
# depend on a particular resampling of the data.

test_score_not_nested = []
test_score_nested = []

N_TRIALS = 20
for i in range(N_TRIALS):
    # For each trial, we use cross-validation splits on independently
    # randomly shuffled data by passing distinct values to the random_state
    # parameter.
    inner_cv = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=i)
    outer_cv = KFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=i)

    # Non_nested parameter search and scoring
    model = GridSearchCV(estimator=model_to_tune, param_grid=param_grid,
                         cv=inner_cv, n_jobs=2)
    model.fit(data, target)
    test_score_not_nested.append(model.best_score_)

    # Nested CV with parameter optimization
    test_score = cross_val_score(model, data, target, cv=outer_cv, n_jobs=2)
    test_score_nested.append(test_score.mean())

# %% [markdown]
# We can merge the data together and make a box plot of the two strategies.

    "Not nested CV": test_score_not_nested,

              "and without nested cross-validation")

# %% [markdown]
# We observe that the generalization performance estimated without using nested
# CV is higher than what we obtain with nested CV. The reason is that the
# tuning procedure itself selects the model with the highest inner CV score. If
# there are many hyper-parameter combinations and if the inner CV scores have
# comparatively large standard deviations, taking the maximum value can lure
# the naive data scientist into over-estimating the true generalization
# performance of the result of the full learning procedure. By using an outer
# cross-validation procedure one gets a more trustworthy estimate of the
# generalization performance of the full learning procedure, including the
# effect of tuning the hyperparameters.
#
# As a conclusion, when optimizing parts of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.
# hyperparameter, transform, etc.), one needs to use nested cross-validation to
# evaluate the generalization performance of the predictive model. Otherwise,
# the results obtained without nested cross-validation are often overly
# optimistic.
