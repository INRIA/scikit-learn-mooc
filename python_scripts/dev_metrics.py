# ## Introduction
# Machine-learning models rely on optimizing an objective function, by seeking
# its minimum or maximum. It is important to understand that this objective
# function is usually decoupled from the evaluation metric that we want to
# optimize in practice. The objective function serves as a proxy to the
# evaluation metric.
#
# While other notebooks will give insights regarding algorithms and their
# associated objective functions, in this notebook we will focus on the
# metrics used to evaluate the performance of a predictive model.
#
# Selecting an evaluation metric will mainly depend on the model chosen to
# solve our datascience problem.
