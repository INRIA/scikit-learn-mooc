# # Ensemble learning: when many are better that the one
#
# In this notebook, we will go in depth into algorithms which combine several
# simple learners (e.g. decision tree, linear model, etc.). We will
# see that combining simple learners will result in a more powerful and robust
# learner.
# We will focus on two families of ensemble methods:
#
# * ensemble using bootstrap (e.g. bagging and random-forest);
# * ensemble using boosting (e.g. adaptive boosting and gradient-boosting
#   decision tree).
#
# ## Benefit of ensemble method at a first glance
#
# In this section, we will give a quick demonstration on the power of combining
# several learners instead of fine-tuning a single learner.
#
# We will start by loading the "California Housing" dataset.

# in California based on demographic and geographic data.

# We start by learning a single decision tree regressor. As we previously
# presented in the "tree in depth" notebook, this learner needs to be tuned to
# overcome over- or under-fitting. Indeed, the default parameters will not
# necessarily lead to an optimal decision tree. Instead of using the default
# value, we should search via cross-validation the optimal value of the
# important parameters such as `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, or
# `min_samples_leaf`.
#
# We recall that we need to tune these parameters, as decision trees
# tend to overfit the training data if we grow deep trees, but there are 
# no rules on what each parameter should be set to. 
# Thus, not making a search could lead us
# to have an underfitted or overfitted model.

#
# First, let's keep a set of data to test our final model.

# %% [markdown]
# From theses results, we can see that the best parameters is the combination
# where the depth of the tree is not limited and the minimum number of samples
# to create a leaf is also equal to 1 (the default values) and the
# minimum number of samples to make a split of 50 (much higher than the default
# value.
#
# It is interesting to look at the total amount of time it took to fit all
# these different models. In addition, we can check the performance of the
# optimal decision tree on the left-out testing data.

# %%

    f"{total_fitting_time:.2f} seconds"
)
print(
    f"Best R2 score of a single tree: {tree.best_score_:.3f}"

# %% [markdown]
# Hence, we have a model that has an $R^2$ score below 0.7. The amount of time
# to find the best learner depends on the number of folds used during the
# cross-validation in the grid-search multiplied by the number of parameters.
# Therefore, the computational cost is quite high.
#
# Now we will use an ensemble method called bagging. More details about this
# method will be discussed in the next section. In short, this method will use
# a base regressor (i.e. decision tree regressors) and will train several of
# them on a slightly modified version of the training set. Then, the
# predictions of all these base regressors will be combined by averaging.
#
# Here, we will use 50 decision trees and check the fitting time as well as
# the performance on the left-out testing data. It is important to note that
# we are not going to tune any parameter of the decision tree.

# We can see that the computation time is much shorter for training the full
# ensemble than for the parameter search of a single tree. In addition, the
# score is significantly improved with a $R^2$ close to 0.8. Furthermore, note
# that this result is obtained before any parameter tuning. This shows the
# motivation behind the use of an ensemble learner: it gives a relatively good
# baseline with decent performance without any parameter tuning.
#
# Now, we will discuss in detail two ensemble families: bagging and
# boosting.
#
# ## Bagging
#
# Bagging stands for Bootstrap AGGregatING. It uses bootstrap 
# (random sampling 
# with replacement) to learn several models.
# At predict time, the predictions of each learner
# are aggregated to give the final predictions.
#
# Let's define a simple dataset (which we have used before in a previous
# notebook).

# The unbroken red line shows the averaged predictions, which would be the

#
# ## Random forest
#
# A popular machine-learning algorithm is the random forest. A Random forest
# is a modification of the bagging algorithm. In bagging, any classifier or
# regressor can be used. In a random forest, the base classifier or regressor
# must be a decision tree. In our previous example, we used a decision
# tree but we could have used a linear model as the regressor for our
# bagging algorithm.
#
# In addition, random forest is different from bagging when used with
# classifiers: when searching for the best split, only a subset of the original
# features are used. By default, this subset of feature is equal to the square
# root of the total number of features. In regression, the total number of
# available features will be used.
#
# We will illustrate the usage of a random forest and compare it with the
# bagging regressor on the "California housing" dataset.

# %%
X, y = california_housing.data, california_housing.target

    f"Performance of random forest: {random_forest.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}"
)
print(f"Performance of bagging: {bagging.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that we don't need to provide a `base_estimator` parameter to
# `RandomForestRegressor`, it is always a tree classifier. Also note that the
# scores are almost identical. This is because our
# problem is a regression problem and therefore, the number of features used
# in random forest and bagging is the same.
#
# For classification problems, we would need to pass a tree model instance
# with the parameter `max_features="sqrt"` to `BaggingRegressor` if we wanted
# it to have the same behaviour as the random forest classifier.
#
# ### Classifiers details
#
# Up to now, we have only focused on regression problems. There is a little
# difference between regression and classification.
#
# First, the `base_estimator` should be chosen in line with the problem that
# is solved: use a classifier with a classification problem and a regressor
# with a regression problem.
#
# Then, the aggregation method is different in regression and classification:
# - in regression, the average prediction is computed. For instance, if
# three learners predict 0.4, 0.3 and 0.31, the aggregation will output 0.33,
# - while in classification, the class which highest probability
# (after averaging the predicted probabilities) is predicted. For instance, if
# three learners predict (for two classes) the probability (0.4, 0.6),
# (0.3, 0.7) and (0.31, 0.69), the aggregation probability is (0.33, 0.67)
# and the second class would be predicted.
#
# ## Summary
#
# We saw in this section two algorithms that use bootstrap samples to create
# an ensemble of classifiers or regressors. These algorithms train several
# learners on different bootstrap samples. The predictions are then
# aggregated. This operation can be done in a very efficient manner since the
# training of each learner can be done in parallel.
#
# ## Boosting
#
# We recall that bagging builds an ensemble in a parallel manner: each learner
# is trained independently from each other. The idea behind boosting is
# different. The ensemble is a sequence of learners where the
# `Nth` learner requires all previous learners, from 1 to `N-1`.
#
# Intuitively, bagging adds learners to the ensemble to correct the
# mistakes of the previous learners. We will start with an
# algorithm named Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to get some intuition about the
# main ideas behind boosting.
#
# ### Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
#
# We will first focus on AdaBoost, which we will use for a classification
# problem.
# We will load the "penguin" dataset used in the "tree in depth" notebook.
# We will predict penguin species from the features culmen length and depth.

culmen_columns = ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]

# %% [markdown]
# In addition, we are also using on the function used the previous
# "tree in depth" notebook
# to plot the decision function of the tree.

# The first classifier was 94% accurate and the second one 69% accurate.
# Therefore, when predicting a class, we should trust the first classifier
# slightly more than the second one. We could use these accuracy values to
# weight the predictions of each learner.
#
# To summarize, boosting learns several classifiers, each of which will
# focus more or less on specific samples of the dataset. Boosting is thus
# different from bagging: here we never resample our dataset, we just assign
# different weights to the original dataset.
#
# Boosting requires some strategy to combine the learners together:
#
# * one needs to define a way to compute the weights to be assigned
#   to samples;
# * one needs to assign a weight to each learner when making predictions.
#
# Indeed, we defined a really simple scheme to assign sample weights and
# learner weights. However, there are statistical theories (like in AdaBoost)
# for how these sample and learner weights can be optimally calculated.
# FIXME: I think we should add a reference to ESL here.

# look at the underlying decision tree classifiers trained.

# algorithms, it is not the most efficient machine-learning algorithm.
# The most efficient algorithm based on boosting is the gradient-boosting

#
# ### Gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT)
#
# Gradient-boosting differs from AdaBoost due to the following reason: instead
# of assigning weights to specific samples, GBDT will fit a decision
# tree on the residuals error (hence the name "gradient") of the previous tree.
# Therefore, each new added tree in the ensemble predicts the error made by the
# previous learner instead of predicting the target directly.

#
# ## Parameter consideration with random forest and gradient-boosting
#
# In the previous section, we did not discuss the parameters of random forest
# and gradient-boosting. However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind
# when setting these parameters.
#
# ### Random forest
#
# The main parameter to tune with random forest is the `n_estimators`
# parameter. In general, the more trees in the forest, the better the
# performance will be. However, it will slow down the fitting and prediction
# time. So one has to balance compute time and performance when setting the
# number of estimators when putting such learner in production.
#
# The `max_depth` parameter could also be tuned. Sometimes, there is no need
# to have fully grown trees. However, be aware that with random forest, trees
# are generally deep since we are seeking to overfit the learners on the
# bootstrap samples because this will be mitigated by combining them.
# Assembling underfitted trees (i.e. shallow trees) might also lead to an
# underfitted forest.

# %%
param_grid = {
    "n_estimators": [10, 20, 30],
    "max_depth": [3, 5, None],
}

    RandomForestRegressor(n_jobs=-1), param_grid=param_grid, n_jobs=-1,
)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

columns = ["params", "mean_test_score", "rank_test_score"]
cv_results = pd.DataFrame(grid_search.cv_results_)
cv_results[columns].sort_values(by="rank_test_score")

# %% [markdown]
# We can observe that in our grid-search, the largest `max_depth` together with
# largest `n_estimators` led to the best performance.
#
# ### Gradient-boosting decision tree
#
# For gradient-boosting, parameters are coupled, so we can not anymore
# set the parameters one after the other. The
# important parameters are `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `learning_rate`.
#
# Let's first discuss the `max_depth` parameter. We saw in the section on
# gradient-boosting that the algorithm fits the error of the previous tree
# in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees will be detrimental. Indeed,
# the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit (overfit) the data and
# thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there would be no residuals.
# Therefore, the tree used in gradient-boosting should have a low depth,
# typically between 3 to 8 levels.
# Having very weak learners at each step will help reducing overfitting.

#
# With this consideration in mind, the deeper the trees, the faster the
# residuals will be corrected and less learners are required. So `n_estimators`
# should be increased if `max_depth` is lower.
#
# Finally, we have overlooked the impact of the `learning_rate` parameter up
# till now. When
# fitting the residuals one could choose if the tree should try to correct all
# possible errors or only a fraction of them. The learning-rate allows you to
# control this behaviour. A small learning-rate value would only correct the
# residuals of very few samples. If a large learning-rate is set (e.g., 1),
# we would fit the residuals of all samples. So, with a very low
# learning-rate, we will need more estimators to correct the overall error.
# However, a too large learning-rate tends to obtain an overfitted ensemble,
# similar to having a too large tree depth.

# %%
param_grid = {
    "n_estimators": [10, 30, 50],
    "max_depth": [3, 5, None],
    "learning_rate": [0.1, 1],
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    GradientBoostingRegressor(), param_grid=param_grid, n_jobs=-1,

# ## Accelerating gradient-boosting
#
# We previously mentioned that random-forest is an efficient algorithm since
# each tree of the ensemble can be fitted at the same time independently.
# Therefore, the algorithm scales efficiently with both the number of CPUs and
# the number of samples.
#
# In gradient-boosting, the algorithm is a sequential algorithm. It requires
# the `N-1` trees to have been fit to be able to fit the tree at stage `N`.
# Therefore, the algorithm is
# quite computationally expensive. The most expensive part in this algorithm is
# the search for the best split in the tree which is a brute-force
# approach: all possible split are evaluated and the best one is picked. We
# explained this process in the notebook "tree in depth", which
# you can refer to.
#
# To accelerate the gradient-boosting algorithm, one could reduce the number of
# splits to be evaluated. As a consequence, the performance of such a
# tree would be reduced. However, since we are combining several trees in a
# gradient-boosting, we can add more estimators to overcome
# this issue.
#
# This algorithm is called `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
# `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`. Each feature in the dataset `X` is first
# binned by computing histograms which are later used to evaluate the potential
# splits. The number
# of splits to evaluate is then much smaller. This algorithm becomes much more
# efficient than gradient boosting when the dataset has 10,000+ samples.
#
# Below we will give an example of a large dataset and we can compare
# computation time with the earlier experiment in the previous section.

# %% [markdown]
# The histogram gradient-boosting is the best algorithm in terms of score.
# It will also scale when the number of samples increases, while the normal
# gradient-boosting will not.
#
# ## Wrap-up
#
# So in this notebook we discussed ensemble learners which are a type of
# learner that combines simpler learners together. We saw two strategies:
# one based on bootstrap samples allowing learners to be fit in a parallel
# manner and the other called boosting which fit learners in a sequential
# manner.
#
# From these two families, we mainly focused on giving intuitions regarding the
# internal machinery of the random forest and gradient-boosting algorithms
# which are state-of-the-art methods.
