# # Exercise 02
#
# The aim of this exercise it to explore some attributes available in
# scikit-learn random forest.
#
# First, we will fit the penguins regression dataset.

# Create a random forest containing only three trees. Train the forest and
# check the performance on the testing set.

# %% [markdown]
# The forest that you created contains three trees that can be accessed with
# the attribute `estimators_`. You will have to:
#
# - create a new dataset containing flipper length between 170 mm and 230 mm;
# - plot the training data using a scatter plot;
# - plot the decision of each individual tree by predicting on the newly
#   created dataset;
# - plot the decision of the random forest using this newly created dataset.
