# # üìù Exercise M6.04
#
# The aim of this exercise is to:
#
# * verify if a GBDT tends to overfit if the number of estimators is not
#   appropriate as previously seen for AdaBoost;
# * use the early-stopping strategy to avoid adding unnecessary trees, to
#   get the best generalization performances.
#
# We will use the California housing dataset to conduct our experiments.

# Create a validation curve to assess the impact of the number of trees
# on the generalization performance of the model. Evaluate the list of parameters
# `param_range = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]` and use the mean absolute error
# to assess the generalization performance of the model.

# Unlike AdaBoost, the gradient boosting model will always improve when
# increasing the number of trees in the ensemble. However, it will reach a
# plateau where adding new trees will just make fitting and scoring slower.
#
# To avoid adding new unnecessary tree, gradient boosting offers an
# early-stopping option. Internally, the algorithm will use an out-of-sample
# set to compute the generalization performance of the model at each addition of a
# tree. Thus, if the generalization performance is not improving for several
# iterations, it will stop adding trees.
#
# Now, create a gradient-boosting model with `n_estimators=1000`. This number
# of trees will be too large. Change the parameter `n_iter_no_change` such
# that the gradient boosting fitting will stop after adding 5 trees that do not
# improve the overall generalization performance.
