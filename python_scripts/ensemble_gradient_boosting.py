# # Gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT)
#
# In this notebook, we will present the gradient boosting decision tree
# algorithm and contrast it with AdaBoost.
#
# Gradient-boosting differs from AdaBoost due to the following reason: instead
# of assigning weights to specific samples, GBDT will fit a decision tree on
# the residuals error (hence the name "gradient") of the previous tree.
# Therefore, each new tree in the ensemble predicts the error made by the
# previous learner instead of predicting the target directly.
#
# In this section, we will provide some intuition about the way learners are
# combined to give the final prediction. In this regard, let's go back to our
# regression problem which is more intuitive for demonstrating the underlying
# machinery.

# Since the tree underfits the data, its accuracy is far from perfect on the
# training data. We can observe this in the figure by looking at the difference
# between the predictions and the ground-truth data. We represent these errors,
# called "Residuals", by unbroken red lines.
#
# Indeed, our initial tree was not expressive enough to handle the complexity
# of the data, as shown by the residuals. In a gradient-boosting algorithm, the
# idea is to create a second tree which, given the same data `data`, will try
# to predict the residuals instead of the vector `target`. We would therefore
# have a tree that is able to predict the errors made by the initial tree.

# In term of computation performance, the forest can be parallelized and will
# benefit from using multiple cores of the CPU. In terms of scoring
# performance, both algorithms lead to very close results.
#
# However, we see that the gradient boosting is a very fast algorithm to
# predict compared to random forest. This is due to the fact that gradient
# boosting uses shallow trees. We will go into details in the next notebook
# about the hyperparameters to consider when optimizing ensemble methods.
