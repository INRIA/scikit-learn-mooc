# # Random forest
#
# In this notebook, we will present the random forest models and
# show the differences with the bagging classifiers.
#
# Random forests are a popular model in machine learning. They are a
# modification of the bagging algorithm. In bagging, any classifier or
# regressor can be used. In random forests, the base classifier or regressor
# must be a decision tree. In our previous example, we used a decision tree but
# we could have used a linear model as the regressor for our bagging algorithm.
#
# In addition, random forests are different from bagging when used with
# classifiers: when searching for the best split, only a subset of the original
# features are used. By default, this subset of features is equal to the square
# root of the total number of features. In regression, the total number of
# available features will be used.
#
# We will illustrate the usage of a random forest and compare it with the
# bagging regressor on the "California housing" dataset.

# Notice that we don't need to provide a `base_estimator` parameter to
# `RandomForestRegressor`: it is always a tree classifier. Also note that the
# scores are almost identical. This is because our problem is a regression
# problem and therefore, the number of features used in random forest and
# bagging is the same.
#
# For classification problems, we would need to pass a tree model instance
# with the parameter `max_features="sqrt"` to `BaggingRegressor` if we wanted
# it to have the same behaviour as the random forest classifier.
#
# ## Classifiers details
#
# Until now, we have focused on regression problems. There are some
# differences between regression and classification.
#
# First, the `base_estimator` should be chosen depending on the problem that
# needs to be solved: use a classifier for a classification problem and a
# regressor for a regression problem.
#
# Secondly, the aggregation method is different:
#
# - in regression, the average prediction is computed. For instance, if
#   three learners predict 0.4, 0.3 and 0.31, the aggregation will output 0.33;
# - while in classification, the class which highest probability (after
#   averaging the predicted probabilities) is predicted. For instance, if three
#   learners predict (for two classes) the probability (0.4, 0.6), (0.3, 0.7)
#   and (0.31, 0.69), the aggregation probability is (0.33, 0.67) and the
#   second class would be predicted.
#
# # Midpoint summary
#
# We saw in this section two algorithms that use bootstrap samples to create
# an ensemble of classifiers or regressors. These algorithms train several
# learners on different bootstrap samples. The predictions are then
# aggregated. This operation can be done in a very efficient manner since the
# training of each learner can be done in parallel.
