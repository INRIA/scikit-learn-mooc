# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise 02
#
# The aim of this exercise it to explore some attributes available in
# scikit-learn's random forest.
#
# First, we will fit the penguins regression dataset.

# %%
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")
feature_names = ["Flipper Length (mm)"]
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[feature_names], penguins[target_name]
data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, random_state=0)

# %% [markdown]
# Create a random forest containing three trees. Train the forest and
# check the statistical performance on the testing set.

# %%
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

forest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=3)
forest.fit(data_train, target_train)
print(f"Accuracy score: {forest.score(data_test, target_test):.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# The next steps of this exercise are to:
#
# - create a new dataset containing the penguins with a flipper length
#   between 170 mm and 230 mm;
# - plot the training data using a scatter plot;
# - plot the decision of each individual tree by predicting on the newly
#   created dataset;
# - plot the decision of the random forest using this newly created dataset.

# ```{tip}
# The trees contained in the forest that you created can be accessed
# with the attribute `estimators_`.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# In a first cell, we will collect all the required predictions from the
# different trees and forest.

# %%
import numpy as np

data_ranges = pd.DataFrame(np.linspace(170, 235, num=300),
                           columns=data.columns)
tree_predictions = []
for tree in forest.estimators_:
    tree_predictions.append(tree.predict(data_ranges))

forest_predictions = forest.predict(data_ranges)

# %% [markdown]
# Now, we can plot the predictions that we collected.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=feature_names[0], y=target_name,
                color="black", alpha=0.5)

# plot tree predictions
for tree_idx, predictions in enumerate(tree_predictions):
    plt.plot(data_ranges, predictions, label=f"Tree #{tree_idx}",
             linestyle="--", alpha=0.8)

plt.plot(data_ranges, forest_predictions, label=f"Random forest")
plt.legend()
