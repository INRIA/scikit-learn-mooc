# So in this notebook we discussed ensemble learners which are a type of
# learner that combines simpler learners together. We saw two strategies:
#
# * one based on bootstrap samples allowing learners to be fit in a parallel
#   manner;
# * the other called boosting which fit learners in a sequential manner.
#
# From these two families, we mainly focused on giving intuitions regarding the
# internal machinery of the random forest and gradient-boosting models which
# are state-of-the-art methods.
