# # Linear Models
#
# In this notebook we will review linear models from `scikit-learn`.
# We will :
# - learn how to fit a simple linear slope and interpret the coefficients;
# - discuss feature augmentation to fit a non-linear function;
# - use `LinearRegression` and its regularized version `Ridge` which is more
#   robust;
# - use `LogisticRegression` with `pipeline`;
# - see examples of linear separability.

# ### The over-simplistic toy example
# To illustrate the main principle of linear regression, we will use a dataset
# containing information about penguins.

# %%
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins.csv")
data.head()

# %% [markdown]
# This dataset contains features of penguins. We will formulate the following
# problem. Observing the flipper length of a penguin, we would like to infer
# is mass.

target_name = "Body Mass (g)"

sns.scatterplot(data=data, x=feature_names, y=target_name)

# select the features of interest
X = data[[feature_names]].dropna()
y = data[target_name].dropna()

# %% [markdown]
# In this problem, the mass of a penguin is our target. It is a continuous
# variable that roughly vary between 2700 g and 6300 g. Thus, this is a
# regression problem (in contrast to classification). We also see that there is
# almost linear relationship between the body mass of the penguin and the
# flipper length. Longer is the flipper, heavier is the penguin.
#
# Thus, we could come with a simple rule that given a length of the flipper
# we could compute the body mass of a penguin using a linear relationship of
# of the form `y = a * x + b` where `a` and `b` are the 2 parameters of our
# model.

# when using a linear model. To obtain a better model, we have mainly 3
# solutions: (i) choose a model that natively can deal with non-linearity,
# (ii) "augment" features by including expert knowledge which can be used by
# the model, or (iii) use a "kernel" to have a locally-based decision function
# instead of a global linear decision function.
#
# Let's illustrate quickly the first point by using a decision tree regressor
# which natively can handle non-linearity.

# In this case, the model can handle the non-linearity. Instead having a model
# which natively can deal with non-linearity, we could modify our data: we
# could create new features, derived from the original features, using some
# expert knowledge. For instance, here we know that we have a cubic and squared
# relationship between `x` and `y` (because we generated the data). Indeed,
# we could create two new features that would add this information in the data.

# We can see that even with a linear model, we overcome the limitation of the
# model by adding the non-linearity component into the design of additional
# features. Here, we created new feature by knowing the way the target was
# generated. In practice, this is usually not the case. Instead, one is usually
# creating interaction between features with different order, at risk of
# creating a model with too much expressivity and wich might overfit. In
# scikit-learn, the `PolynomialFeatures` is a transformer to create such
# feature interactions which we could have used instead of creating new 
# features ourself.
#

# To present the `PolynomialFeatures`, we are going to use a scikit-learn 
# pipeline which will first create the new features and then fit the model.
# We will later comeback to details regarding scikit-learn pipeline.

# **FIXME: it might be to complex to be introduced here but it seems good in

#
# The last possibility to make a linear model more expressive is to use

# emphasized, a weight will be assign by sample instead. However, not all
# sample will be used. This is the base of the support vector machine

# ### Linear regression in higher dimension
# In the previous example, we usually used only a single feature. But we
# already shown that we could add new feature to make the model more expressive
# by deriving this new features based on the original feature.
#
# Indeed, we could also use additional features which are decorrelated with the
# original feature and that could help us to predict the target.
#
# We will load a dataset reporting the median house value in California.
# The dataset in made of 8 features regarding demography and geography of the

# Note that in the first example, we did not care about scaling our data to
# keep the original units and have better intuition. However, this is a good

# transform the data when calling `transform`. Therefore, it is important to
# note that `fit` should only be called on the training data similarly to the
# classifier or regressor.
#
# In the example above, `X_train_scaled` are data scaled after computing the
# mean and standard deviation of each feature considering the training data.
# `X_test_scaled` are data scaled using the mean and standard deviation of each

# Instead of manually transforming the data by calling the transformer,
# scikit-learn provide a `Pipeline` allowing to call a sequence of
# transformer(s) followed by a regressor or a classifier. This pipeline exposed

# `fit` and `transform` for you, avoiding any mistake with data leakage.
#
# We already presented `Pipeline` in the second notebook and we will use it

# ### Un-penalized logistic regression
#
# The linear regression that we previously saw will predict a continuous
# output. When the target is a binary outcome, one can use the logistic
# function to model the probability. This model is known as logistic
# regression.
#
# Scikit-learn provides the class `LogisticRegression` which implement this
# algorithm.

# %%

logistic_regression = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression(penalty="none")
)
plot_decision_function(X_train, y_train, logistic_regression)

# %% [markdown]
# Thus, we see that our decision function is represented by a line separating
# the 2 classes. Since the line is oblique, it means that we used a
# combination of both features:

# %%
print(logistic_regression[-1].coef_)

# %% [markdown]
# Indeed, both coefficients are non-null.
#
# ### Apply some regularization when fitting the logistic model
#
# The `LogisticRegression` model
# allows to apply regularization via the parameter `C`. It would be equivalent
# to shift from `LinearRegression` to `Ridge`. On the contrary to `Ridge`, the
# `C` parameter is the inverse of the regularization strength: a smaller `C`
# will lead to a more regularized model. We can check the effect of
# regularization on our model:

    plot_decision_function(
        X_train, y_train, logistic_regression, ax=ax,
    )

# %% [markdown]
# A more regularized model will make the coefficients tend to 0. Since one of
# the feature is considered less important when fitting the model (lower
# coefficient magnitude), only one of the feature will be used when C is small.
# This feature is the culmen length which is in line with our first insight
# that we found when plotting the marginal feature probabilities.
#
# Just like the `RidgeCV` class which automatically find the optimal `alpha`, 
# one can use `LogisticRegressionCV` to find the best `C` on the training data.

# ### Beyond linear separation
#
# As we saw in regression, the linear classification model expects the data
# to be linearly separable. When this assumption does not hold, the model
# is not enough expressive to properly fit the data. One need to apply the same
# tricks than in regression: feature augmentation (using expert-knowledge
# potentially) or using method based on kernel.
#
# We will provide examples where we will use a kernel support vector machine
# to make classification on some toy-dataset where it is impossible to find a perfect linear
# separation

#
# - `LinearRegression` find the best slope which minimize the mean squared
#   error on the train set
# - `Ridge` could be better on the test set, thanks to its regularization
# - `RidgeCV` and `LogisiticRegressionCV` find the best relugarization thanks
#   to cross validation on the training data
# - `pipeline` can be used to combinate a scaler and a model
# - If the data are not linearly separable, we shall use a more complex model
#   or use feature augmentation
