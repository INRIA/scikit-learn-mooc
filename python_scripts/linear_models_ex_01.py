# # üìù Exercise M4.01
#
# The aim of this exercise is two-fold:
#
# * understand the parametrization of a linear model;
# * quantify the fitting accuracy of a set of such models.
#
# We will reuse part of the code of the course to:
#
# * load data;
# * create the function representing a linear model.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Data loading

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")
feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[[feature_name]], penguins[target_name]

# ### Model definition

def linear_model_flipper_mass(
    flipper_length, weight_flipper_length, intercept_body_mass
):
    """Linear model of the form y = a * x + b"""
    body_mass = weight_flipper_length * flipper_length + intercept_body_mass
    return body_mass

# ## Main exercise
#
# Given a vector of the flipper length, several weights and intercepts to
# plot several linear model that could fit our data. Use the above
# visualization helper function to visualize both the model and data.

# %%
import numpy as np

flipper_length_range = np.linspace(data.min(), data.max(), num=300)

# %%
# Write your code here.
# weights = [...]
# intercepts = [...]


# %% [markdown]
# In the previous question, you were asked to create several linear models.
# The visualization allowed you to qualitatively assess if a model was better
# than another.
#
# Now, you should come up with a quantitative measure which will indicate the
# goodness of fit of each linear model. This quantitative metric should result
# in a single scalar and allow you to pick up the best model.


# %%
def goodness_fit_measure(true_values, predictions):
    # Write your code here.
    # Define a measure indicating the goodness of fit of a model given the true
    # values and the model predictions.
    pass


# %%
# Uncomment the code below.
# for model_idx, (weight, intercept) in enumerate(zip(weights, intercepts)):
#     target_predicted = linear_model_flipper_mass(data, weight, intercept)
#     print(f"Model #{model_idx}:")
#     print(f"{weight:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {intercept:.2f} (g)")
#     print(f"Error: {goodness_fit_measure(target, target_predicted):.3f}\n")
