# # üìù Exercise M4.01
#
# The aim of this exercise is two-fold:
#
# * understand the parametrization of a linear model;
# * quantify the fitting accuracy of a set of such models.
#
# We will reuse part of the code of the course to:
#
# * load data;
# * create the function representing a linear model.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Data loading

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")
feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[[feature_name]], penguins[target_name]

# %% [markdown]
# ### Model definition


# %%
def linear_model_flipper_mass(
    flipper_length, weight_flipper_length, intercept_body_mass
):
    """Linear model of the form y = a * x + b"""
    body_mass = weight_flipper_length * flipper_length + intercept_body_mass
    return body_mass

# ## Main exercise
#
# Define a vector `weights = [...]` and a vector `intercepts = [...]` of
# the same length. Each pair of entries `(weights[i], intercepts[i])` tags a
# different model. Use these vectors along with the vector
# `flipper_length_range` to plot several linear models that could possibly
# fit our data. Use the above helper function to visualize both the models and
# the real samples.

# %%
import numpy as np

flipper_length_range = np.linspace(data.min(), data.max(), num=300)

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# In the previous question, you were asked to create several linear models.
# The visualization allowed you to qualitatively assess if a model was better
# than another.
#
# Now, you should come up with a quantitative measure which indicates the
# goodness of fit of each linear model and allows you to select the best model.
# Define a function `goodness_fit_measure(true_values, predictions)` that takes
# as inputs the true target values and the predictions and returns a single
# scalar as output.


# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# You can now copy and paste the code below to show the goodness of fit for
# each model.
#
# ```python
# for model_idx, (weight, intercept) in enumerate(zip(weights, intercepts)):
#     target_predicted = linear_model_flipper_mass(data, weight, intercept)
#     print(f"Model #{model_idx}:")
#     print(f"{weight:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {intercept:.2f} (g)")
#     print(f"Error: {goodness_fit_measure(target, target_predicted):.3f}\n")
# ```

# %%
# Write your code here.
