# # üìù Exercise M4.02
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed that we can add new features based on the
# original feature `x` to make the model more expressive, for instance `x ** 2` or
# `x ** 3`. In that case we only used a single feature in `data`.
#
# The aim of this notebook is to train a linear regression algorithm on a
# dataset with more than a single feature. In such a "multi-dimensional" feature
# space we can derive new features of the form `x1 * x2`, `x2 * x3`, etc.
# Products of features are usually called "non-linear" or "multiplicative"
# interactions between features.
#
# Feature engineering can be an important step of a model pipeline as long as
# the new features are expected to be predictive. For instance, think of a
# classification model to decide if a patient has risk of developing a heart
# disease. This would depend on the patient's Body Mass Index which is defined
# as `weight / height ** 2`.
#
# We load the dataset penguins dataset. We first use a set of 3 numerical
# features to predict the target, i.e. the body mass of the penguin.

# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.

target_name = "Body Mass (g)"

# Remove lines with missing values for the columns of interest

# Now it is your turn to train a linear regression model on this dataset. First,
# create a linear regression model.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Execute a cross-validation with 10 folds and use the mean absolute error (MAE)
# as metric.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Compute the mean and std of the MAE in grams (g). Remember you have to revert
# the sign introduced when metrics start with `neg_`, such as in
# `"neg_mean_absolute_error"`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Now create a pipeline using `make_pipeline` consisting of a
# `PolynomialFeatures` and a linear regression. Set `degree=2` and
# `interaction_only=True` to the feature engineering step. Remember not to
# include a "bias" feature (that is a constant-valued feature) to avoid
# introducing a redundancy with the intercept of the subsequent linear
# regression model.
#
# You may want to use the `.set_output(transform="pandas")` method of the
# pipeline to answer the next question.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Transform the first 5 rows of the dataset and look at the column names. How
# many features are generated at the output of the `PolynomialFeatures` step in
# the previous pipeline?

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Check that the values for the new interaction features are correct for a few
# of them.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Use the same cross-validation strategy as done previously to estimate the mean
# and std of the MAE in grams (g) for such a pipeline. Compare with the results
# without feature engineering.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
#
# Now let's try to build an alternative pipeline with an adjustable number of
# intermediate features while keeping a similar predictive power. To do so, try
# using the `Nystroem` transformer instead of `PolynomialFeatures`. Set the
# kernel parameter to `"poly"` and `degree` to 2. Adjust the number of
# components to be as small as possible while keeping a good cross-validation
# performance.
#
# Hint: Use a `ValidationCurveDisplay` with `param_range = np.array([5, 10, 50,
# 100])` to find the optimal `n_components`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# How do the mean and std of the MAE for the Nystroem pipeline with optimal
# `n_components` compare to the other previous models?

# %%
# Write your code here.
