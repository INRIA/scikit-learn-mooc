# # Exercise 03
#
# In all previous notebooks, we only used a single feature in `X`. But we have
# already shown that we could add new feature to make the model more expressive
# by deriving new features, based on the original feature.
#
# The aim of this notebook is to train a linear regression algorithm on a
# dataset more than a single feature.
#
# We will load a dataset about house prices in California.
# The dataset consists of 8 features regarding the demography and geography of
# districts in California and the aim is to predict the median house price of
# each district. We will use all 8 features to predict the target, median
# house price.

X, y = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)
X.head()

# Now this is your turn to train a linear regression model on this dataset.
# You will need to:
# * split the dataset into a training and testing set;
# * train a linear regression model on the training set;
# * compute the mean absolute error in k$;
# * show the values of the coefficients for each feature.
