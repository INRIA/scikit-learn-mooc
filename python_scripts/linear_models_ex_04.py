# # üìù Exercise M4.04
#
# In the previous Module we tuned the hyperparameter `C` of the logistic
# regression without mentioning that it controls the regularization strength.
# Later, on the slides on üé• **Intuitions on regularized linear models** we
# metioned that a small `C` provides a more regularized model, whereas a
# non-regularized model is obtained with an infinitely large value of `C`.
# Indeed, `C` behaves as the inverse of the `alpha` coefficient in the `Ridge`
# model.
#
# In this exercise, we ask you to train a logistic regression classifier using
# different values of the parameter `C` to find its effects by yourself.
#
# We start by loading the dataset. We only keep the Adelie and Chinstrap classes
# to keep the discussion simple.

# We define a function to help us fit a given `model` and plot its decision
# boundary. We recall that by using a `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` with diverging
# colormap, `vmin=0` and `vmax=1`, we ensure that the 0.5 probability is mapped
# to the white color. Equivalently, the darker the color, the closer the
# predicted probability is to 0 or 1 and the more confident the classifier is in
# its predictions.

# ## Influence of the parameter `C` on the decision boundary
#
# Given the following candidates for the `C` parameter and the
# `plot_decision_boundary` function, find out the impact of `C` on the
# classifier's decision boundary.
#
# - How does the value of `C` impact the confidence on the predictions?
# - How does it impact the underfit/overfit trade-off?
# - How does it impact the position and orientation of the decision boundary?
#
# Try to give an interpretation on the reason for such behavior.

# ## Impact of the regularization on the weights
#
# Look at the impact of the `C` hyperparameter on the magnitude of the weights.
# **Hint**: You can [access pipeline
# steps](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#access-pipeline-steps)
# by name or position. Then you can query the attributes of that step such as
# `coef_`.

# ## Impact of the regularization on with non-linear feature engineering
#
# Use the `plot_decision_boundary` function to repeat the experiment using a
# non-linear feature engineering pipeline. For such purpose, insert
# `Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=1, n_components=100)` between the
# `StandardScaler` and the `LogisticRegression` steps.
#
# - Does the value of `C` still impact the position of the decision boundary and
#   the confidence of the model?
# - What can you say about the impact of `C` on the underfitting vs overfitting
#   trade-off?
