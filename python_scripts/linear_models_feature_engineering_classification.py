# # Non-linear feature engineering for Logistic Regression
#
# In the slides at the beginning of the module we mentioned that linear
# classification models are not suited to non-linearly separable data.
# Nevertheless, one can still use feature engineering as previously done for
# regression models to overcome this issue. To do so, we use non-linear
# transformations that typically map the original feature space into a higher
# dimension space, where the linear model can separate the data more easily.
#
# Let us illustrate this on three synthetic datasets. Each dataset has two
# original features and two classes to make it easy to visualize. The first
# dataset is called the "moons" dataset as the data points from each class are
# shaped as a crescent moon:

# %%
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons

feature_names = ["Feature #0", "Feature #1"]
target_name = "class"

X, y = make_moons(n_samples=100, noise=0.13, random_state=42)

# We store both the data and target in a dataframe to ease plotting
moons = pd.DataFrame(
    np.concatenate([X, y[:, np.newaxis]], axis=1),
    columns=feature_names + [target_name],
)
data_moons, target_moons = moons[feature_names], moons[target_name]

# %% [markdown]
#
# The second dataset is called the "Gaussian quantiles" dataset as all data
# points are sampled from a 2D Gaussian distribution regardless of the class.
# The points closest to the center are assigned to the class 1 while the points
# in the outer edges are assigned to the class 0, resulting in concentric
# circles.

# %%
from sklearn.datasets import make_gaussian_quantiles

X, y = make_gaussian_quantiles(
    n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_classes=2, random_state=42
)
gauss = pd.DataFrame(
    np.concatenate([X, y[:, np.newaxis]], axis=1),
    columns=feature_names + [target_name],
)
data_gauss, target_gauss = gauss[feature_names], gauss[target_name]

# %% [markdown]
#
# The third dataset is called the "XOR" dataset as the data points are sampled
# from a uniform distribution in a 2D space and the class is defined by the
# Exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the two features: the target class is 1 if
# only one of the two features is greater than 0. The target class is 0
# otherwise.

# %%
xor = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.RandomState(0).uniform(low=-1, high=1, size=(200, 2)),
    columns=feature_names,
)
target_xor = np.logical_xor(xor["Feature #0"] > 0, xor["Feature #1"] > 0)
target_xor = target_xor.astype(np.int32)
xor["class"] = target_xor
data_xor = xor[feature_names]

# %% [markdown]
#
# We use matplotlib to visualize all the datasets at a glance:

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap

# Now let's define our logistic regression model and plot its decision boundary
# on the three datasets:

# %%
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

logistic_regression = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())
logistic_regression

# %%
plot_decision_boundary(logistic_regression, title="Linear classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# This confirms that it is not possible to separate the two classes with a
# linear model. On each plot we see a **significant number of misclassified
# samples on the training set**! The three plots show typical cases of
# **underfitting** for linear models.
#
# Also, the last two plots show soft colors, meaning that the model is highly
# unsure about which class to choose.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Engineering non-linear features
#
# As we did for the linear regression models, we now attempt to build a more
# expressive machine learning pipeline by leveraging non-linear feature
# engineering, with techniques such as binning, splines, polynomial features,
# and kernel approximation.
#
# Let's start with the binning transformation of the features:

# %%
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer

classifier = make_pipeline(
    KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, encode="onehot"),  # already the default params
    LogisticRegression(),
)
classifier

# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Binning classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# We can see that the resulting decision boundary is constrained to follow
# **axis-aligned segments**, which is very similar to what a decision tree would
# do as we will see in the next Module. Furthermore, as for decision trees, the
# model makes piecewise constant predictions within each rectangular region.
#
# This axis-aligned decision boundary is not necessarily the natural decision
# boundary a human would have intuitively drawn for the moons dataset and the
# Gaussian quantiles datasets. It still makes it possible for the model to
# successfully separate the data. However, binning alone does not help the
# classifier separate the data for the XOR dataset. This is because **the
# binning transformation is a feature-wise transformation** and thus **cannot
# capture interactions** between features that are necessary to separate the
# XOR dataset.
#
# Let's now consider a **spline** transformation of the original features. This
# transformation can be considered a **smooth version of the binning
# transformation**. You can find more details in the [scikit-learn user guide](
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#spline-transformer).

# %%
from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer

classifier = make_pipeline(
    SplineTransformer(degree=3, n_knots=5),
    LogisticRegression(),
)
classifier

# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Spline classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# We can see that the decision boundary is now smooth, and while it favors
# axis-aligned decision rules when extrapolating in low density regions, it can
# adopt a more curvy decision boundary in the high density regions.
# However, as for the binning transformation, the model still fails to separate
# the data for the XOR dataset, irrespective of the number of knots, for the
# same reasons: **the spline transformation is a feature-wise transformation**
# and thus **cannot capture interactions** between features.
#
# Take into account that the number of knots is a hyperparameter that needs to be
# tuned. If we use too few knots, the model would underfit the data, as shown on
# the moons dataset. If we use too many knots, the model would overfit the data.
#
# ```{note}
# Notice that `KBinsDiscretizer(encode="onehot")` and `SplineTransformer` do not
# require additional scaling. Indeed, they can replace the scaling step for
# numerical features: they both create features with values in the [0, 1] range.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Modeling non-additive feature interactions
#
# We now consider feature engineering techniques that non-linearly combine the
# original features in the hope of capturing interactions between them. We will
# consider polynomial features and kernel approximation.
#
# Let's start with the polynomial features:

# %%
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

classifier = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(),
    PolynomialFeatures(degree=3, include_bias=False),
    LogisticRegression(C=10),
)
classifier

# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Polynomial classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# We can see that the decision boundary of this polynomial classifier is
# **smooth** and can successfully separate the data on all three datasets
# (depending on how we set the values of the `degree` and `C`
# hyperparameters).
#
# It is interesting to observe that this models extrapolates very differently
# from the previous models: its decision boundary can take a diagonal
# direction. Furthermore, we can observe that predictions are very confident in
# the low density regions of the feature space, even very close to the decision
# boundary
#
# We can obtain very similar results by using a kernel approximation technique
# such as the Nyström method with a polynomial kernel:

#  %%
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

classifier = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(),
    Nystroem(kernel="poly", degree=3, coef0=1, n_components=100),
    LogisticRegression(C=10),
)
classifier
# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Polynomial Nystroem classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# The polynomial kernel approach would be interesting in cases were the
# original feature space is already of high dimension: in these cases,
# **computing the complete polynomial expansion** with `PolynomialFeatures`
# could be **intractable**, while Nyström method can control the output
# dimensionality with the `n_components` parameter.
#
# Let's now explore the use of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel:

# %%
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

classifier = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(),
    Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=1, n_components=100),
    LogisticRegression(C=5),
)
classifier
# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="RBF Nystroem classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# The resulting decision boundary is **smooth** and can successfully separate
# the classes for all three datasets. Furthemore, the model extrapolates very
# differently: in particular, it tends to be **much less confident in its
# predictions in the low density regions** of the feature space.
#
# As for the previous polynomial pipelines, this pipeline **does not favor
# axis-aligned decision rules**. It can be shown mathematically that the
# [inductive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias) of our RBF
# pipeline is actually rotationally invariant.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Multi-step feature engineering
#
# It is possible to combine several feature engineering transformers in a
# single pipeline to blend their respective inductive biases. For instance, we
# can combine the binning transformation with a kernel approximation:

# %%
classifier = make_pipeline(
    KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5),
    Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=1.0, n_components=100),
    LogisticRegression(),
)
classifier
# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Binning + Nystroem classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# It is interesting to observe that this model is still piecewise constant with
# axis-aligned decision boundaries everywhere, but it can now successfully deal
# with the XOR problem thanks to the second step of the pipeline that can
# model the interactions between the features transformed by the first step.
#
# We can also combine the spline transformation with a kernel approximation:

# %%
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

classifier = make_pipeline(
    SplineTransformer(n_knots=5),
    Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=1.0, n_components=100),
    LogisticRegression(),
)
classifier

# %%
plot_decision_boundary(classifier, title="Spline + RBF Nystroem classifier")

# %% [markdown]
#
# The decision boundary of this pipeline is smooth, but with axis-aligned
# extrapolation.
#
# Depending on the task, this can be considered an advantage or a drawback.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Summary and take-away messages
#
# - Linear models such as logistic regression can be used for classification on
#   non-linearly separable datasets by leveraging non-linear feature
#   engineering.
# - Transformers such as `KBinsDiscretizer` and `SplineTransformer` can be used
#   to engineer non-linear features independently for each original feature.
# - As a result, these transformers cannot capture interactions between the
#   orignal features (and then would fail on the XOR classification task).
# - Despite this limitation they already augment the expressivity of the
#   pipeline, which can be sufficient for some datasets.
# - They also favor axis-aligned decision boundaries, in particular in the low
#   density regions of the feature space (axis-aligned extrapolation).
# - Transformers such as `PolynomialFeatures` and `Nystroem` can be used to
#   engineer non-linear features that capture interactions between the original
#   features.
# - It can be useful to combine several feature engineering transformers in a
#   single pipeline to build a more expressive model, for instance to favor
#   axis-aligned extrapolation while also capturing interactions.
# - In particular, if the original dataset has both numerical and categorical
#   features, it can be useful to apply binning or a spline transformation to the
#   numerical features and one-hot encoding to the categorical features. Then,
#   the resulting features can be combined with a kernel approximation to model
#   interactions between numerical and categorical features. This can be
#   achieved with the help of `ColumnTransformer`.
#
# In subsequent notebooks and exercises, we will further explore the interplay
# between regularization, feature engineering, and the under-fitting /
# overfitting trade-off.
#
# But first we will do an exercise to illustrate the relationship between the
# Nyström kernel approximation and support vector machines.
