# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise M4.01
#
# The aim of this exercise is two-fold:
#
# * understand the parametrization of a linear model;
# * quantify the fitting accuracy of a set of such models.
#
# We will reuse part of the code of the course to:
#
# * load data;
# * create the function representing a linear model.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Data loading

# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")
feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[[feature_name]], penguins[target_name]

# ## Main exercise
#
# Define a vector `weights = [...]` and a vector `intercepts = [...]` of
# the same length. Each pair of entries `(weights[i], intercepts[i])` tags a
# different model. Use these vectors along with the vector
# `flipper_length_range` to plot several linear models that could possibly
# fit our data. Use the above helper function to visualize both the models and
# the real samples.

import numpy as np

flipper_length_range = np.linspace(data.min(), data.max(), num=300)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

weights = [-40, 45, 90]
intercepts = [15000, -5000, -14000]

                     color="black", alpha=0.5)

label = "{0:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {1:.2f} (g)"
for weight, intercept in zip(weights, intercepts):
    predicted_body_mass = linear_model_flipper_mass(
        flipper_length_range, weight, intercept)

    ax.plot(flipper_length_range, predicted_body_mass,

# In the previous question, you were asked to create several linear models.
# The visualization allowed you to qualitatively assess if a model was better
# than another.
#
# Now, you should come up with a quantitative measure which indicates the
# goodness of fit of each linear model and allows you to select the best model.
# Define a function `goodness_fit_measure(true_values, predictions)` that takes
# as inputs the true target values and the predictions and returns a single
# scalar as output.


# %%
# solution
def goodness_fit_measure(true_values, predictions):
    # we compute the error between the true values and the predictions of our
    # model
    errors = np.ravel(true_values) - np.ravel(predictions)
    # We have several possible strategies to reduce all errors to a single value.
    # Computing the mean error (sum divided by the number of element) might seem
    # like a good solution. However, we have negative errors that will misleadingly
    # reduce the mean error. Therefore, we can either square each
    # error or take the absolute value: these metrics are known as mean
    # squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Let's use the MAE here
    # as an example.
    return np.mean(np.abs(errors))

# %% [markdown]
# You can now copy and paste the code below to show the goodness of fit for
# each model.
#
# ```python
# for model_idx, (weight, intercept) in enumerate(zip(weights, intercepts)):
#     target_predicted = linear_model_flipper_mass(data, weight, intercept)
#     print(f"Model #{model_idx}:")
#     print(f"{weight:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {intercept:.2f} (g)")
#     print(f"Error: {goodness_fit_measure(target, target_predicted):.3f}\n")
# ```

# %%
# solution
for model_idx, (weight, intercept) in enumerate(zip(weights, intercepts)):
    target_predicted = linear_model_flipper_mass(data, weight, intercept)
    print(f"Model #{model_idx}:")
    print(f"{weight:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {intercept:.2f} (g)")
    print(f"Error: {goodness_fit_measure(target, target_predicted):.3f}\n")
