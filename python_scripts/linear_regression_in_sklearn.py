# # Linear regression using scikit-learn
#
# In the previous notebook, we presented the parametrization of a linear model.
# During the exercise, you saw that varying parameters will give different models
# that will fit better or worse the data. To evaluate quantitatively this
# goodness of fit, you implemented a so-called metric.
#
# When doing machine learning, you are interested in selecting the model which
# will minimize the error on the data available the most.
# From the previous exercise, we could implement a brute-force approach,
# varying the weights and intercept and select the model with the lowest error.
#
# Hopefully, this problem of finding the best parameters values (i.e. that
# result in the lowest error) can be solved without the need to check every
# potential parameter combination. Indeed, this problem has a closed-form
# solution: the best parameter values can be found by solving an equation. This
# avoids the need for brute-force search. This strategy is implemented in
# scikit-learn.

# The instance `linear_regression` will store the parameter values in the
# attributes `coef_` and `intercept_`. We can check what the optimal model
# found is:

weight_flipper_length = linear_regression.coef_[0]
weight_flipper_length

intercept_body_mass = linear_regression.intercept_
intercept_body_mass

# In the solution of the previous exercise, we implemented a function to
# compute the goodness of fit of a model. Indeed, we mentioned two metrics: (i)
# the mean squared error and (ii) the mean absolute error. These metrics are
# implemented in scikit-learn and we do not need to use our own implementation.
#
# We can first compute the mean squared error.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

inferred_body_mass = linear_regression.predict(data)
model_error = mean_squared_error(target, inferred_body_mass)
print(f"The mean squared error of the optimal model is {model_error:.2f}")

# %% [markdown]
# A linear regression model minimizes the mean squared error on the training
# set. This means that the parameters obtained after the fit (i.e. `coef_` and
# `intercept_`) are the optimal parameters that minimizes the mean squared
# error. In other words, any other choice of parameters will yield a model with
# a higher mean squared error on the training set.
#
# However, the mean squared error is difficult to interpret. The mean absolute
# error is more intuitive since it provides an error in the same unit as the
# one of the target.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

model_error = mean_absolute_error(target, inferred_body_mass)
print(f"The mean absolute error of the optimal model is {model_error:.2f} g")

# %% [markdown]
# A mean absolute error of 313 means that in average, our model make an error
# of Â± 313 grams when predicting the body mass of a penguin given its flipper
# length.
