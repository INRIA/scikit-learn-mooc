# # Linear regression without scikit-learn
#
# In this notebook, we introduce linear regression. Before presenting the
# available scikit-learn classes, we will provide some insights with a simple
# example. We will use a dataset that contains measurements taken on penguins.

# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.

# We will formulate the following problem: using the flipper length of a penguin, 
# we would like to infer its mass.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

feature_names = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[[feature_names]], penguins[target_name]

ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=feature_names, y=target_name,
                     color="black", alpha=0.5)
ax.set_title("Flipper length in function of the body mass")

# ```{tip}
# The function `scatterplot` from searborn take as input the full dataframe
# and the parameter `x` and `y` allows to specify the name of the columns to
# be plotted. Note that this function returns a matplotlib axis
# (named `ax` in the example above) that can be further used to add elements on
# the same matplotlib axis (such as a title).

# In this problem, penguin mass is our target. It is a continuous
# variable that roughly varies between 2700 g and 6300 g. Thus, this is a
# regression problem (in contrast to classification). We also see that there is
# almost a linear relationship between the body mass of the penguin and its
# flipper length. The longer the flipper, the heavier the penguin.
#
# Thus, we could come up with a simple formula, where given a flipper length
# we could compute the body mass of a penguin using a linear relationship
# of the form `y = a * x + b` where `a` and `b` are the 2 parameters of our
# model.

# `flipper_length` in order to make the inference. When this coefficient is
# positive, it means that penguins with longer flipper lengths will have larger
# body masses. If the coefficient is negative, it means that penguins with
# shorter flipper lengths have larger body masses. Graphically, this
# coefficient is represented by the slope of the curve in the plot. Below we
# show what the curve would look like when the `weight_flipper_length`
# coefficient is negative.
