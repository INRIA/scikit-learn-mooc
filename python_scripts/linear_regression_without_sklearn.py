# # Linear regression without scikit-learn
#
# In this notebook, we introduce linear regression. Before to present class
# available in scikit-learn, we present some insights with a simple example.
# We will use a dataset that contains information about penguins.

# %%
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")
data.head()

# %% [markdown]
# This dataset contains measurements taken of penguins. We will formulate the
# following problem: using the flipper length of a penguin, we would like
# to infer its mass.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

feature_names = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
X, y = data[[feature_names]], data[target_name]

sns.scatterplot(data=data, x=feature_names, y=target_name)

# %% [markdown]
# In this problem, penguin mass is our target. It is a continuous
# variable that roughly varies between 2700 g and 6300 g. Thus, this is a
# regression problem (in contrast to classification). We also see that there is
# almost a linear relationship between the body mass of the penguin and the
# flipper length. The longer the flipper, the heavier the penguin.
#
# Thus, we could come up with a simple formula, where given a flipper length
# we could compute the body mass of a penguin using a linear relationship of
# of the form `y = a * x + b` where `a` and `b` are the 2 parameters of our
# model.

# The variable `weight_flipper_length` is a weight applied to the feature
# `flipper_length` in
# order to make the inference. When this coefficient is positive, it means that
# penguins with longer flipper lengths will have larger body masses.
# If the coefficient is negative, it means that penguins with shorter flipper
# flipper lengths have larger body masses. Graphically, this coefficient is
# represented by the slope of the curve in the plot. Below we show what the
# curve would look like when the `weight_flipper_length` coefficient is
# negative.
