# # Linear model for classification
# In regression, we saw that the target to be predicted was a continuous
# variable. In classification, this target will be discrete (e.g. categorical).
#
# We will go back to our penguin dataset. However, this time we will try to
# predict the penguin species using the culmen information. We will also
# simplify our classification problem by selecting only 2 of the penguin
# species to solve a binary classification problem.

# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_classification.csv")

# only keep the Adelie and Chinstrap classes
penguins = penguins.set_index("Species").loc[
    ["Adelie", "Chinstrap"]].reset_index()
culmen_columns = ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]
target_column = "Species"

# %% [markdown]
# We can quickly start by visualizing the feature distribution by class:

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for feature_name in culmen_columns:
    plt.figure()
    # plot the histogram for each specie
    penguins.groupby("Species")[feature_name].plot.hist(alpha=0.5, legend=True)
    plt.xlabel(feature_name)

# %% [markdown]
# We can observe that we have quite a simple problem. When the culmen
# length increases, the probability that the penguin is a Chinstrap is closer
# to 1. However, the culmen depth is not helpful for predicting the penguin
# species.
#
# For model fitting, we will separate the target from the data and
# we will create a training and a testing set.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

penguins_train, penguins_test = train_test_split(penguins, random_state=0)

data_train = penguins_train[culmen_columns]
data_test = penguins_test[culmen_columns]

target_train = penguins_train[target_column]
target_test = penguins_test[target_column]

#
# The linear regression that we previously saw will predict a continuous
# output. When the target is a binary outcome, one can use the logistic
# function to model the probability. This model is known as logistic
# regression.
#
# Scikit-learn provides the class `LogisticRegression` which implements this
# algorithm.

# %%
import sklearn
sklearn.set_config(display="diagram")

# %%
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

logistic_regression = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression(penalty="none")
)
logistic_regression.fit(data_train, target_train)
accuracy = logistic_regression.score(data_test, target_test)
print(f"Accuracy on test set: {accuracy:.3f}")

# Since we are dealing with a classification problem containing only 2
# features, it is then possible to observe the decision function boundary.
# The boundary is the rule used by our predictive model to affect a class label
# given the feature values of the sample.
#
# ```{note}
# Here, we will use the class `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`. We provide this class
# to allow making plots of the decision function boundary in a 2 dimensional
# space. The implementation can be found [here](
# https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/blob/main/python_scripts/helpers/plotting.py).
# This class is intended to be part of the `scikit-learn` package in the future
# as it is proposed in the following [Pull-Request](
# https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16061).
# ```

import seaborn as sns
from helpers.plotting import DecisionBoundaryDisplay

DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(
    logistic_regression, data_test, response_method="predict", cmap="RdBu_r", alpha=0.5

    data=penguins_test, x=culmen_columns[0], y=culmen_columns[1],
    hue=target_column, palette=["tab:red", "tab:blue"])
_ = plt.title("Decision boundary of the trained\n LogisticRegression")

# %% [markdown]
# Thus, we see that our decision function is represented by a line separating
# the 2 classes. We should also note that we did not impose any regularization
# by setting the parameter `penalty` to `'none'`.
#
# Since the line is oblique, it means that we used a combination of both
# features:

# %%
coefs = logistic_regression[-1].coef_[0]  # the coefficients is a 2d array
weights = pd.Series(coefs, index=culmen_columns)

# %%
weights.plot.barh()
_ = plt.title("Weights of the logistic regression")

# %% [markdown]
# Indeed, both coefficients are non-null.
