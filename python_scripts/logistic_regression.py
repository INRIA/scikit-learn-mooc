# # Linear model for classification
#
# In regression, we saw that the target to be predicted is a continuous
# variable. In classification, the target is discrete (e.g. categorical).
#
# In this notebook we go back to the penguin dataset. However, this time the
# task is to predict the penguin species using the culmen information. We also
# simplify our classification problem by selecting only 2 of the penguin species
# to solve a binary classification problem.

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_classification.csv")

# only keep the Adelie and Chinstrap classes
penguins = (
    penguins.set_index("Species").loc[["Adelie", "Chinstrap"]].reset_index()
)
culmen_columns = ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]
target_column = "Species"

# %% [markdown]
# We can quickly start by visualizing the feature distribution by class:

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for feature_name in culmen_columns:
    plt.figure()
    # plot the histogram for each specie
    penguins.groupby("Species")[feature_name].plot.hist(alpha=0.5, legend=True)
    plt.xlabel(feature_name)

# %% [markdown]
# We can observe that we have quite a simple problem. When the culmen length
# increases, the probability that the penguin is a Chinstrap is closer to 1.
# However, the culmen depth is not helpful for predicting the penguin species.
#
# For model fitting, we separate the target from the data and we create a
# training and a testing set.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

penguins_train, penguins_test = train_test_split(penguins, random_state=0)

data_train = penguins_train[culmen_columns]
data_test = penguins_test[culmen_columns]

target_train = penguins_train[target_column]
target_test = penguins_test[target_column]

# The linear regression that we previously saw predicts a continuous output.
# When the target is a binary outcome, one can use the logistic function to
# model the probability. This model is known as logistic regression.
#
# Scikit-learn provides the class `LogisticRegression` which implements this
# algorithm.

# %%
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

logistic_regression = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())
logistic_regression.fit(data_train, target_train)
accuracy = logistic_regression.score(data_test, target_test)
print(f"Accuracy on test set: {accuracy:.3f}")

# Since we are dealing with a classification problem containing only 2 features,
# it is then possible to observe the decision function boundary. The boundary is
# the rule used by our predictive model to affect a class label given the
# feature values of the sample.
#
# ```{note}
# Here, we use the class `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`. This educational tool allows
# us to gain some insights by plotting the decision function boundary learned by
# the classifier in a 2 dimensional feature space.
#
# Notice however that in more realistic machine learning contexts, one would
# typically fit on more than two features at once and therefore it would not be
# possible to display such a visualization of the decision boundary in
# general.
# ```

# Thus, we see that our decision function is represented by a line separating
# the 2 classes.
#
# Since the line is oblique, it means that we used a combination of both
# features:

# %%
coefs = logistic_regression[-1].coef_[0]  # the coefficients is a 2d array
weights = pd.Series(coefs, index=culmen_columns)

# %%
weights.plot.barh()
_ = plt.title("Weights of the logistic regression")

# %% [markdown]
# Indeed, both coefficients are non-null. If one of them had been zero, the
# decision boundary would have been either horizontal or vertical.
#
# Furthermore the intercept is also non-zero, which means that the decision does
# not go through the point with (0, 0) coordinates.
#
# For the mathematically inclined reader, the equation of the decision boundary
# is:
#
#     coef0 * x0 + coef1 * x1 + intercept = 0
#
# where `x0` is `"Culmen Length (mm)"` and `x1` is `"Culmen Depth (mm)"`.
#
# This equation is equivalent to (assuming that `coef1` is non-zero):
#
#     x1 = coef0 / coef1 * x0 - intercept / coef1
#
# which is the equation of a straight line.
#
# ## (Estimated) predicted probabilities
#
# The `predict` method in classification models returns what we call a "hard
# class prediction", i.e. the most likely class a given data point would belong
# to. We can confirm the intuition given by the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` by
# testing on a hypothetical `sample`:

# %%
test_penguin = pd.DataFrame(
    {"Culmen Length (mm)": [45], "Culmen Depth (mm)": [17]}
)
logistic_regression.predict(test_penguin)

# %% [markdown]
# In this case, our logistic regression classifier predicts the Chinstrap
# species. Note that this agrees with the decision boundary plot above: the
# coordinates of this test data point match a location close to the decision
# boundary, in the red region.
#
# As mentioned in the introductory slides ðŸŽ¥ **Intuitions on linear models**,
# one can alternatively use the `predict_proba` method to compute continuous
# values ("soft predictions") that correspond to an estimation of the confidence
# of the target belonging to each class.

# %%
y_pred_proba = logistic_regression.predict_proba(test_penguin)
y_pred_proba

# %%
y_proba_sample = pd.Series(
    y_pred_proba.ravel(), index=logistic_regression.classes_
)
y_proba_sample.plot.bar()
plt.ylabel("Estimated probability")
_ = plt.title("Probability of the sample belonging to a penguin class")

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the (estimated) predicted probabilities sum to one.
#
# ```{warning}
# We insist that the output of `predict_proba` are just estimations. Their
# reliability on being a good estimate of the true conditional class-assignment
# probabilities depends on the quality of the model. Even classifiers with a
# high accuracy on a test set may be overconfident for some individuals and
# underconfident for others.
# ```
#
# Similarly to the hard decision boundary shown above, one can set the
# `response_method` to `"predict_proba"` in the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` to
# rather show the confidence on individual classifications. In such case the
# boundaries encode the estimated probablities by color. In particular, when
# using [matplotlib diverging
# colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html#diverging)
# such as `"RdBu_r"`, the softer the color, the more unsure about which class to
# choose (the probability of 0.5 is mapped to white).
