# # Classification
#
# This notebook aims at giving an overview of the classification metrics that
# can be used to evaluate the predictive model generalization performance. We can
# recall that in a classification setting, the vector `target` is categorical
# rather than continuous.
#
# We will load the blood transfusion dataset.

# %%
import pandas as pd

blood_transfusion = pd.read_csv("../datasets/blood_transfusion.csv")
data = blood_transfusion.drop(columns="Class")
target = blood_transfusion["Class"]

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# Let's start by checking the classes present in the target vector `target`.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

target.value_counts().plot.barh()
plt.xlabel("Number of samples")
_ = plt.title("Number of samples per classes present\n in the target")

# %% [markdown]
# We can see that the vector `target` contains two classes corresponding to
# whether a subject gave blood. We will use a logistic regression classifier to
# predict this outcome.
#
# To focus on the metrics presentation, we will only use a single split instead
# of cross-validation.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, shuffle=True, random_state=0, test_size=0.5)

# %% [markdown]
# We will use a logistic regression classifier as a base model. We will train
# the model on the train set, and later use the test set to compute the
# different classification metric.

# %%
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(data_train, target_train)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Classifier predictions
# Before we go into details regarding the metrics, we will recall what type
# of predictions a classifier can provide.
#
# For this reason, we will create a synthetic sample for a new potential donor:
# he/she donated blood twice in the past (1000 c.c. each time). The last time
# was 6 months ago, and the first time goes back to 20 months ago.

# %%
new_donor = [[6, 2, 1000, 20]]

# %% [markdown]
# We can get the class predicted by the classifier by calling the method
# `predict`.

# %%
classifier.predict(new_donor)

# %% [markdown]
# With this information, our classifier predicts that this synthetic subject
# is more likely to not donate blood again.
#
# However, we cannot check whether the prediction is correct (we do not know
# the true target value). That's the purpose of the testing set. First, we
# predict whether a subject will give blood with the help of the trained
# classifier.

# %%
target_predicted = classifier.predict(data_test)
target_predicted[:5]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Accuracy as a baseline
# Now that we have these predictions, we can compare them with the true
# predictions (sometimes called ground-truth) which we did not use until now.

# %%
target_test == target_predicted

# %% [markdown]
# In the comparison above, a `True` value means that the value predicted by our
# classifier is identical to the real value, while a `False` means that our
# classifier made a mistake. One way of getting an overall rate representing
# the generalization performance of our classifier would be to compute how many
# times our classifier was right and divide it by the number of samples in our
# set.

# %%
import numpy as np

np.mean(target_test == target_predicted)

# %% [markdown]
# This measure is called the accuracy. Here, our classifier is 78%
# accurate at classifying if a subject will give blood. `scikit-learn` provides
# a function that computes this metric in the module `sklearn.metrics`.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(target_test, target_predicted)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# `LogisticRegression` also has a method named `score` (part of the standard
# scikit-learn API), which computes the accuracy score.

# %%
classifier.score(data_test, target_test)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Confusion matrix and derived metrics
# The comparison that we did above and the accuracy that we calculated did not
# take into account the type of error our classifier was making. Accuracy
# is an aggregate of the errors made by the classifier. We may be interested
# in finer granularity - to know independently what the error is for each of
# the two following cases:
#
# - we predicted that a person will give blood but she/he did not;
# - we predicted that a person will not give blood but she/he did.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix

_ = plot_confusion_matrix(classifier, data_test, target_test)

# %% [markdown]
# The in-diagonal numbers are related to predictions that were correct
# while off-diagonal numbers are related to incorrect predictions
# (misclassifications). We now know the four types of correct and erroneous
# predictions:
#
# * the top left corner are true positives (TP) and corresponds to people
#   who gave blood and were predicted as such by the classifier;
# * the bottom right corner are true negatives (TN) and correspond to
#   people who did not give blood and were predicted as such by the
#   classifier;
# * the top right corner are false negatives (FN) and correspond to
#   people who gave blood but were predicted to not have given blood;
# * the bottom left corner are false positives (FP) and correspond to
#   people who did not give blood but were predicted to have given blood.
#
# Once we have split this information, we can compute metrics to highlight the
# generalization performance of our classifier in a particular setting. For
# instance, we could be interested in the fraction of people who really gave
# blood when the classifier predicted so or the fraction of people predicted to
# have given blood out of the total population that actually did so.
#
# The former metric, known as the precision, is defined as TP / (TP + FP)
# and represents how likely the person actually gave blood when the classifier
# predicted that they did.
# The latter, known as the recall, defined as TP / (TP + FN) and
# assesses how well the classifier is able to correctly identify people who
# did give blood.
# We could, similarly to accuracy, manually compute these values,
# however scikit-learn provides functions to compute these statistics.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

precision = precision_score(target_test, target_predicted, pos_label="donated")
recall = recall_score(target_test, target_predicted, pos_label="donated")

print(f"Precision score: {precision:.3f}")
print(f"Recall score: {recall:.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# These results are in line with what was seen in the confusion matrix. Looking
# at the left column, more than half of the "donated" predictions were correct,
# leading to a precision above 0.5. However, our classifier mislabeled a lot of
# people who gave blood as "not donated", leading to a very low recall of
# around 0.1.
#
# ## The issue of class imbalance
# At this stage, we could ask ourself a reasonable question. While the accuracy
# did not look bad (i.e. 77%), the recall score is relatively low (i.e. 12%).
#
# As we mentioned, precision and recall only focuses on samples predicted to be
# positive, while accuracy takes both into account. In addition, we did not
# look at the ratio of classes (labels). We could check this ratio in the
# training set.

# %%
target_train.value_counts(normalize=True).plot.barh()
plt.xlabel("Class frequency")
_ = plt.title("Class frequency in the training set")

# %% [markdown]
# We observe that the positive class, `'donated'`, comprises only 24% of the
# samples. The good accuracy of our classifier is then linked to its ability to
# correctly predict the negative class `'not donated'` which may or may not be
# relevant, depending on the application. We can illustrate the issue using a
# dummy classifier as a baseline.

# %%
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier

dummy_classifier = DummyClassifier(strategy="most_frequent")
dummy_classifier.fit(data_train, target_train)
print(f"Accuracy of the dummy classifier: "
      f"{dummy_classifier.score(data_test, target_test):.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# With the dummy classifier, which always predicts the negative class `'not
# donated'`, we obtain an accuracy score of 76%. Therefore, it means that this
# classifier, without learning anything from the data `data`, is capable of
# predicting as accurately as our logistic regression model.
#
# The problem illustrated above is also known as the class imbalance problem.
# When the classes are imbalanced, accuracy should not be used. In this case,
# one should either use the precision and recall as presented above or the
# balanced accuracy score instead of accuracy.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score

balanced_accuracy = balanced_accuracy_score(target_test, target_predicted)
print(f"Balanced accuracy: {balanced_accuracy:.3f}")
# %% [markdown]
# The balanced accuracy is equivalent to accuracy in the context of balanced
# classes. It is defined as the average recall obtained on each class.
#
# ## Evaluation and different probability thresholds
#
# All statistics that we presented up to now rely on `classifier.predict` which
# outputs the most likely label. We haven't made use of the probability
# associated with this prediction, which gives the confidence of the
# classifier in this prediction. By default, the prediction of a classifier
# corresponds to a threshold of 0.5 probability in a binary classification
# problem. We can quickly check this relationship with the classifier that
# we trained.

# %%
target_proba_predicted = pd.DataFrame(classifier.predict_proba(data_test),
                                      columns=classifier.classes_)
target_proba_predicted[:5]

# %%
target_predicted = classifier.predict(data_test)
target_predicted[:5]

# %% [markdown]
# Since probabilities sum to 1 we can get the class with the highest
# probability without using the threshold 0.5.

# %%
equivalence_pred_proba = (
    target_proba_predicted.idxmax(axis=1).to_numpy() == target_predicted)
np.all(equivalence_pred_proba)

# %% [markdown]
# The default decision threshold (0.5) might not be the best threshold that
# leads to optimal generalization performance of our classifier. In this case, one
# can vary the decision threshold, and therefore the underlying prediction, and
# compute the same statistics presented earlier. Usually, the two metrics
# recall and precision are computed and plotted on a graph. Each metric plotted
# on a graph axis and each point on the graph corresponds to a specific
# decision threshold. Let's start by computing the precision-recall curve.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import plot_precision_recall_curve

disp = plot_precision_recall_curve(
    classifier, data_test, target_test, pos_label='donated',
    marker="+"
)
_ = disp.ax_.set_title("Precision-recall curve")

# %% [markdown]
# ```{tip}
# Scikit-learn will return a display containing all plotting element. Notably,
# displays will expose a matplotlib axis, named `ax_`, that can be used to add
# new element on the axis.
# You can refer to the documentation to have more information regarding the
# [visualizations in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html#visualizations)
# ```
#
# On this curve, each blue cross corresponds to a level of probability which we
# used as a decision threshold. We can see that, by varying this decision
# threshold, we get different precision vs. recall values.
#
# A perfect classifier would have a precision of 1 for all recall values. A
# metric characterizing the curve is linked to the area under the curve (AUC)
# and is named average precision (AP). With an ideal classifier, the average
# precision would be 1.
#
# The precision and recall metric focuses on the positive class, however, one
# might be interested in the compromise between accurately discriminating the
# positive class and accurately discriminating the negative classes. The
# statistics used for this are sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is just
# another name for recall. However, specificity measures the proportion of
# correctly classified samples in the negative class defined as: TN / (TN +
# FP). Similar to the precision-recall curve, sensitivity and specificity are
# generally plotted as a curve called the receiver operating characteristic
# (ROC) curve. Below is such a curve:

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve

disp = plot_roc_curve(
    classifier, data_test, target_test, pos_label='donated',
    marker="+")
disp = plot_roc_curve(
    dummy_classifier, data_test, target_test, pos_label='donated',
    color="tab:orange", linestyle="--", ax=disp.ax_)
_ = disp.ax_.set_title("ROC AUC curve")

# %% [markdown]
# This curve was built using the same principle as the precision-recall curve:
# we vary the probability threshold for determining "hard" prediction and
# compute the metrics. As with the precision-recall curve, we can compute the
# area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) to characterize the generalization performance of
# our classifier. However, it is important to observe that the lower bound of
# the ROC-AUC is 0.5. Indeed, we show the generalization performance of a dummy
# classifier (the orange dashed line) to show that even the worst generalization
# performance obtained will be above this line.
