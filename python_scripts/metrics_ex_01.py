# # üìù Exercise 01
#
# We presented different classification metrics in the previous notebook.
# However, we did not use it with a cross-validation. This exercise aims at
# practising and implementing cross-validation that will use such score.
#
# We will reuse the same blood transfusion dataset.

# %%
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("../datasets/blood_transfusion.csv")
X, y = data.drop(columns="Class"), data["Class"]

# %% [markdown]
# First, create a decision tree classifier.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Create a `StratifiedKFold` cross-validation object. Then use it inside the
# `cross_val_score` function to evaluate the decision tree. We will first use
# the accuracy as a score function. Check the documentation of the parameter
# `scoring` in `cross_val_score` to check how to explicitely mention to compute
# the accuracy (even if this is the default score).

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Repeat the experiment by computing the `balanced_accuracy`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# We will now add a bit of complexity. We would like to compute the precision
# of our model. However, during the course we saw that we need to mention the
# positive label which in our case we consider to be the class `donated`.
#
# We will show that computing the precision without providing the positive
# label will not be supported by scikit-learn because it is indeed ambiguous.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
try:
    scores = cross_val_score(tree, X, y, cv=10, scoring="precision")

# We get an exception because by default `pos_label=1` which is not the case
# in our case. Thus, we would like to specify a parameter linked to the score
# function. In this case, we need to create a scorer using the scoring function
# and the helper function `make_scorer`.
#
# So, import `sklearn.metrics.make_scorer` and
# `sklearn.metrics.precision_score`. Check the documentation of `make_scorer`.
# Finally, create a scorer by calling `make_scorer` using the score function
# `precision_score` and pass the extra parameter `pos_label="donated"`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Now, instead to provide the string `"precision"` to the `scoring` parameter
# in the `cross_val_score` call, pass the scorer that you created above.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# `cross_val_score` will only compute a single score provided to the `scoring`
# parameter. The function `cross_validate` allows to compute multiple score
# which could be handy by passing a list of string or scorer to the parameter
# scoring.
#
# Import `sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate` and compute the accuracy and
# balanced accuracy through cross-validation. Plot the cross-validation score
# for both metrics using a box plot.

# %%
# Write your code here.
