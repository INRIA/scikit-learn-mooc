# # üìù Exercise M3.01
#
# The goal is to write an exhaustive search to find the best parameters
# combination maximizing the model generalization performance.
#
# Here we use a small subset of the Adult Census dataset to make the code
# faster to execute. Once your code works on the small subset, try to
# change `train_size` to a larger value (e.g. 0.8 for 80% instead of
# 20%).

# Use the previously defined model (called `model`) and using two nested `for`
# loops, make a search of the best combinations of the `learning_rate` and
# `max_leaf_nodes` parameters. In this regard, you will need to train and test
# the model by setting the parameters. The evaluation of the model should be
# performed using `cross_val_score` on the training set. We will use the
# following parameters search:
# - `learning_rate` for the values 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10. This parameter controls
#   the ability of a new tree to correct the error of the previous sequence of
#   trees
# - `max_leaf_nodes` for the values 3, 10, 30. This parameter controls the
#   depth of each tree.

# Now use the test set to score the model using the best parameters
# that we found using cross-validation in the training set.
