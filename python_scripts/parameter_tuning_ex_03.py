#
# The goal is to find the best set of hyperparameters which maximize the
# generalization performance on a training set.
#
# Here again with limit the size of the training set to make computation
# run faster. Feel free to increase the `train_size` value if your computer
# is powerful enough.

# In this exercise, we will progressively define the classification pipeline
# and later tune its hyperparameters.
#
# Our pipeline should:
# * preprocess the categorical columns using a `OneHotEncoder` and use a
#   `StandardScaler` to normalize the numerical data.
# * use a `LogisticRegression` as a predictive model.
#
# Start by defining the columns and the preprocessing pipelines to be applied
# on each group of columns.

# Subsequently, create a `ColumnTransformer` to redirect the specific columns

# Use `RandomizedSearchCV` with `n_iter=20` to find the best set of
# hyperparameters by tuning the following parameters of the `model`:
#
# - the parameter `C` of the `LogisticRegression` with values ranging from
#   0.001 to 10. You can use a log-uniform distribution
#   (i.e. `scipy.stats.loguniform`);
# - the parameter `with_mean` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`;
# - the parameter `with_std` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`.
#
# Once the computation has completed, print the best combination of parameters
# stored in the `best_params_` attribute.
