# The goal is to find the best set of hyperparameters which maximize the
# generalization performance on a training set.

# In this exercise, we will progressively define the regression pipeline
# and later tune its hyperparameters.
#
# Start by defining a pipeline that:
# * uses a `StandardScaler` to normalize the numerical data;
# * uses a `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` as a predictive model.

# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Use `RandomizedSearchCV` with `n_iter=20` to find the best set of
# hyperparameters by tuning the following parameters of the `model`:
#
# - the parameter `n_neighbors` of the `KNeighborsRegressor` with values
#   `np.logspace(0, 3, num=10).astype(np.int32)`;
# - the parameter `with_mean` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`;
# - the parameter `with_std` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`.
#
# Notice that in the notebook "Hyperparameter tuning by randomized-search" we
# pass distributions to be sampled by the `RandomizedSearchCV`. In this case we
# define a fixed grid of hyperparameters to be explored. Using a `GridSearchCV`
# instead would explore all the possible combinations on the grid, which can be
# costly to compute for large grids, whereas the parameter `n_iter` of the
# `RandomizedSearchCV` controls the number of different random combination that
# are evaluated. Notice that setting `n_iter` larger than the number of possible
# combinations in a grid (in this case 10 x 2 x 2 = 40) would lead to repeating
# already-explored combinations.
#
# Once the computation has completed, print the best combination of parameters
# stored in the `best_params_` attribute.
