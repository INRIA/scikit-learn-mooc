# # Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
#
# In the previous notebooks, we saw two approaches to tune hyperparameters:
# via grid-search and randomized-search.
#
# In this notebook, we will show how to combine such hyperparameters search
# with a cross-validation.

# ## Our predictive model
#
# Let us reload the dataset as we did previously:

# %%
from sklearn import set_config

set_config(display="diagram")

# %%
import pandas as pd

adult_census = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census.csv")

# %% [markdown]
# We extract the column containing the target.

# %%
target_name = "class"
target = adult_census[target_name]
target

# %% [markdown]
# We drop from our data the target and the `"education-num"` column which
# duplicates the information from the `"education"` column.

# %%
data = adult_census.drop(columns=[target_name, "education-num"])
data.head()

# %% [markdown]
# Once the dataset is loaded, we split it into a training and testing sets.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, random_state=42)

# %% [markdown]
# We will create the same predictive pipeline as seen in the grid-search
# section.

# ## Include a hyperparameter search within a cross-validation
#
# As mentioned earlier, using a single train-test split during the grid-search
# does not give any information regarding the different sources of variations:
# variations in terms of test score or hyperparameters values.
#
# To get reliable information, the hyperparameters search need to be nested
# within a cross-validation.
#
# ```{note}
# To limit the computational cost, we affect `cv` to a low integer. In
# practice, the number of fold should be much higher.
# ```

# The hyperparameters on each fold are potentially different since we nested
# the grid-search in the cross-validation. Thus, checking the variation of the
# hyperparameters across folds should also be analyzed.

# Indeed, it would become difficult to set them.
