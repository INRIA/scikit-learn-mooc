# # Hyperparameter tuning by randomized-search
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed how to use a grid-search approach to
# search for the best hyperparameters maximizing the statistical performance
# of a predictive model.
#
# However, a grid-search approach has limitations. It does not scale when
# the number of parameters to tune is increasing. Also, the grid will imposed
# a regularity during the search which might be problematic.
#
# In this notebook, we will present the another method to tune hyperparameters
# called randomized search.

# ## Our predictive model
#
# Let us reload the dataset as we did previously:

# %%
from sklearn import set_config

set_config(display="diagram")

# %%
import pandas as pd

adult_census = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census.csv")

# %% [markdown]
# We extract the column containing the target.

# %%
target_name = "class"
target = adult_census[target_name]
target

# %% [markdown]
# We drop from our data the target and the `"education-num"` column which
# duplicates the information with `"education"` columns.

# %%
data = adult_census.drop(columns=[target_name, "education-num"])
data.head()

# %% [markdown]
# Once the dataset is loaded, we split it into a training and testing sets.

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, random_state=42)

# %% [markdown]
# We will create the same predictive pipeline as seen in the grid-search
# section.

# ## Tuning using a randomized-search
#
# With the `GridSearchCV` estimator, the parameters need to be specified
# explicitly. We already mentioned that exploring a large number of values for
# different parameters will be quickly untractable.
#
# Instead, we can randomly generate the parameter candidates. Indeed,
# such approach avoids the regularity of the grid. Hence, adding more
# evaluations can increase the resolution in each direction. This is the
# case in the frequent situation where the choice of some hyperparameters
# is not very important, as for hyperparameter 2 in the figure below.
#
# ![Randomized vs grid search](../figures/grid_vs_random_search.svg)
#
# Indeed, the number of evaluation points need to be divided across the
# two different hyperparameters. With a grid, the danger is that the
# region of good hyperparameters fall between the line of the grid: this
# region is aligned with the grid given that hyperparameter 2 has a weak
# influence. Rather, stochastic search will sample hyperparameter 1
# independently from hyperparameter 2 and find the optimal region.
#
# The `RandomizedSearchCV` class allows for such stochastic search. It is
# used similarly to the `GridSearchCV` but the sampling distributions
# need to be specified instead of the parameter values. For instance, we
# will draw candidates using a log-uniform distribution because the parameters
# we are interested in take positive values with a natural log scaling (.1 is
# as close to 1 as 10 is).
#
# ```{note}
# Random search (with `RandomizedSearchCV`) is typically beneficial compared
# to grid search (with `GridSearchCV`) to optimize 3 or more
# hyperparameters.
# ```
#
# We will optimize 3 other parameters in addition to the ones we
# optimized above:
#
# * `max_iter`: it corresponds to the number of trees in the ensemble;
# * `min_samples_leaf`: it corresponds to the minimum number of samples
#   required in a leaf;
# * `max_bins`: it corresponds to the maximum number of bins to construct the
#   histograms.
#
# ```{note}
# `scipy.stats.loguniform` can be used to generate floating numbers. To
# generate random values for integer-valued parameters (e.g.
# `min_samples_leaf`) we can adapt is as follows:
# ```

# %%
from scipy.stats import loguniform


class loguniform_int:
    """Integer valued version of the log-uniform distribution"""
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self._distribution = loguniform(a, b)

    def rvs(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Random variable sample"""
        return self._distribution.rvs(*args, **kwargs).astype(int)


# %% [markdown]
#
# Now, we can define the randomized search using the different distributions.
# Executing 10 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation for random
# parametrizations of this model on this dataset can take from 10 seconds to
# several minutes, depending on the speed of the host computer and the number
# of available processors.

# The parallel coordinates plot will display the values of the hyperparameters
# on different columns while the performance metric is color coded. Thus, we
# are able to quickly inspect if there is a range of hyperparameters which is
# working or not.
#
# ```{note}
# We **transformed most axis values by taking a log10 or log2** to
# spread the active ranges and improve the readability of the plot.
# ```
#
# In particular for this hyper-parameter search, it is interesting to see that
# the yellow lines (top performing models) all reach intermediate values for
# the learning rate, that is, tick values between -2 and 0 which correspond to
# learning rate values of 0.01 to 1.0 once we invert the log10 transform for
# that axis.
#
# It is possible to **select a range of results by clicking and holding on any
# axis** of the parallel coordinate plot. You can then slide (move) the range
# selection and cross two selections to see the intersections. You can undo a
# selection by clicking once again on the same axis.
#
# We also observe that it is not possible to select the highest performing
# models by selecting lines of on the `max_bins` axis with tick values between
# 1 and 3.
#
# The other hyper-parameters are not very sensitive. We can check that if we
# select the `learning_rate` axis tick values between -1.5 and -0.5 and
# `max_bins` tick values between 5 and 8, we always select top performing
# models, whatever the values of the other hyper-parameters.

#
# In this notebook, we have seen how randomized search offer a valuable
# alternative to grid-search when the number of hyperparameters to tune is more
# than two. It also alleviates the regularity imposed by the grid that might be
# problematic sometimes.
