# In this exercise, we will progressively define the regression pipeline
# and later tune its hyperparameters.
#
# Start by defining pipeline that:
# * uses a `StandardScaler` to normalize the numerical data;
# * uses a `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` as a predictive model.

# %% [markdown]
# Use `RandomizedSearchCV` with `n_iter=20` to find the best set of
# hyperparameters by tuning the following parameters of the `model`:
#
# - the parameter `n_neighbors` of the `KNeighborsRegressor` with values
#   `[1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15]`
# - the parameter `with_mean` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`;
# - the parameter `with_std` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`.
#
# Notice that in the notebook "Hyperparameter tuning by randomized-search" we
# pass distributions to be sampled by the `RandomizedSearchCV`. In this case we
# define a fixed grid of hyperparameters to be explored. Using a `GridSearchCV`
# instead would explore all the possible combinations on the grid, which can be
# costly to compute for large grids, whereas the parameter `n_iter` of the
# `RandomizedSearchCV` controls the number of different random combination that
# are evaluated. Notice that setting `n_iter` larger than the number of possible
# combinations in a grid (in this case 7 x 2 x 2 = 28) would lead to repeating
# already-explored combinations.
#
# Once the computation has completed, print the best combination of parameters
# stored in the `best_params_` attribute.

# So the best hyperparameters give a model where the features are scaled but not

# Getting the best parameter combinations is the main outcome of the

# assess the sensitivity of the best models to the choice of those parameters.
# The following code, not required to answer the quiz question shows how to
# conduct such an interactive analysis for this this pipeline using a parallel
# coordinate plot using the `plotly` library.

# In addition, the parallel coordinate plot from `plotly` expects all data to

# and False is mapped to 0.

# We recall that it is possible to select a range of results by clicking and
# holding on any axis of the parallel coordinate plot. You can then slide
# (move) the range selection and cross two selections to see the intersections.
#
# Selecting the best performing models (i.e. above an accuracy of ~0.68), we
# observe the following pattern:
#
# - scaling the data is important. All the best performing models are scaling
#   the data;
# - centering the data does not have a strong impact. Both approaches, centering
#   and not centering, can lead to good models;
# - using some neighbors is fine but using too many is a problem. In particular
#   no pipeline with `n_neighbors=1` can be found among the best models. In this
#   case, scaling has a bigger impact than the hyperparameter itself!
