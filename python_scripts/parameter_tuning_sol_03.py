# In this exercise, we will progressively define the regression pipeline
# and later tune its hyperparameters.
#
# Start by defining a pipeline that:
# * uses a `StandardScaler` to normalize the numerical data;
# * uses a `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` as a predictive model.

# Use `RandomizedSearchCV` with `n_iter=20` to find the best set of
# hyperparameters by tuning the following parameters of the `model`:
#
# - the parameter `n_neighbors` of the `KNeighborsRegressor` with values
#   `np.logspace(0, 3, num=10).astype(np.int32)`;
# - the parameter `with_mean` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`;
# - the parameter `with_std` of the `StandardScaler` with possible values
#   `True` or `False`.
#
# Notice that in the notebook "Hyperparameter tuning by randomized-search" we
# pass distributions to be sampled by the `RandomizedSearchCV`. In this case we
# define a fixed grid of hyperparameters to be explored. Using a `GridSearchCV`
# instead would explore all the possible combinations on the grid, which can be
# costly to compute for large grids, whereas the parameter `n_iter` of the
# `RandomizedSearchCV` controls the number of different random combination that
# are evaluated. Notice that setting `n_iter` larger than the number of possible
# combinations in a grid (in this case 10 x 2 x 2 = 40) would lead to repeating
# already-explored combinations.
#
# Once the computation has completed, print the best combination of parameters
# stored in the `best_params_` attribute.

# conduct such an interactive analysis for this this pipeline using a parallel

# In addition, the parallel coordinate plot from `plotly` expects all data to be

# False is mapped to 0. As `n_neighbors` has `dtype=object`, we also convert it
# explicitly to an integer.

# We recall that it is possible to select a range of results by clicking and
# holding on any axis of the parallel coordinate plot. You can then slide
# (move) the range selection and cross two selections to see the intersections.
#
# Selecting the best performing models (i.e. above an accuracy of ~0.68), we
# observe that **in this case**:
#
# - scaling the data is important. All the best performing models use scaled
#   features;
# - centering the data does not have a strong impact. Both approaches, centering
#   and not centering, can lead to good models;
# - using some neighbors is fine but using too many is a problem. In particular
#   no pipeline with `n_neighbors=1` can be found among the best models.
#   However, scaling features has an even stronger impact than the choice of
#   `n_neighbors` in this problem.
#
# The reason is that fitting scaled data leads to a completely different
# KNeighbors model:  if you have two variables A and B where A has values which
# vary between 0 and 10,000 (e.g. the variable `"Population"`) and B is a
# feature that varies between 1 and 10 (e.g. the variable `"AveRooms"`), then
# distances between samples (rows of the dataframe) are mostly impacted by
# differences in values of the column A, while values of the column B will be
# comparatively ignored. If one applies StandardScaler to such a database, both
# the values of A and B will be approximately between -3 and 3 and the neighbor
# structure will be impacted more or less equivalently by both variables.
#
# Note that **in this case** the models with scaled features perform better
# than the models with non-scaled features because all the variables are
# expected to be predictive and we rather avoid some of them being comparatively
# ignored.
#
# If the variables in lower scales were not predictive one may experience a
# decrease of the performance after scaling the features: noisy features would
# contribute more to the prediction after scaling and therefore scaling would
# increase overfitting.
