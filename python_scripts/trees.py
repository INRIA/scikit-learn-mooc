# # Decision tree in depth
#
# In this notebook, we will go into details on the internal algorithm used to
# build the decision tree. First, we will focus on the decision tree used for
# classification. Then, we will highlight the fundamental difference between
# decision tree used in classification and in regression. Finally, we will
# quickly discuss the importance of the hyperparameters to be aware of when
# using decision trees.
#
# ## Presentation of the dataset
#
# We use the
# [Palmer penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).
# This dataset is composed of penguins records and ultimately, we want to
# identify from which specie a penguin belongs to.
#
# A penguin is from one of the three following species: Adelie, Gentoo, and
# Chinstrap. See the illustration below depicting of the three different bird
# species:
#
# ![Image of penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)
#
# This problem is a classification problem since the target is made of
# categories. We will limit our input data to a subset of the original features
# to simplify our explanations when presenting the decision tree algorithm.
# Indeed, we will use feature based on penguins' culmen measurement. You can
# learn more about the penguins' culmen with illustration below:

# * The Gentoo specie is separable from the Adelie and Chinstrap species using
#   the culmen depth.
#
# ## How decision tree are built?
#
# In a previous notebook, we learnt that a linear classifier will define a
# linear separation to split classes using a linear combination of the input
# features. In our 2-dimensional space, it means that a linear classifier will
# defined some oblique lines that best separate our classes. We define a
# function below that given a set of data point and a classifier will plot the
# decision boundaries learnt by the classifier.

# (42 mm) because it is the split leading to the least amount of error. Thus,
# if we want to automatically find such a threshold, we would need a way to
# evaluate the goodness (or pureness) of a given threshold.
#
# ### The split purity criterion
#
# To evaluate the effectiveness of a split, we will use a criterion to qualify
# the class purity on the different partitions.
#
# First, let's define a threshold at 42 mm. Then, we will divide the data into
# 2 sub-groups: a group for samples < 42 mm and a group for samples >= 42 mm.
# Then, we will store the class label for these samples.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# We can check the proportion of samples of each class in both partitions. This
# proportion is the probability of each class when considering
# the partition.

# %%
labels_below_threshold.value_counts(normalize=True).sort_index()

# %%
labels_above_threshold.value_counts(normalize=True).sort_index()


# %% [markdown]
# As we visually assess, the partition defined by < 42 mm has mainly Adelie
# penguin and only 2 samples which we could considered misclassified. However,
# on the partition >= 42 mm, we cannot differentiate Gentoo and Chinstrap
# (while they are almost twice more Gentoo).
#
# We should come with a statistical measure which combine the class
# probabilities together that can be used as a criterion to qualify the purity
# of a partition. We will choose as an example the entropy criterion (also used
# in scikit-learn) which is one of the possible classification criterion.
#
# The entropy is defined as: $H(X) = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} p(X_k) \log p(X_k)$
#
# For a binary problem, the entropy function for one of the class can be
# depicted as follows:
#
# ![title](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Binary_entropy_plot.svg)
#
# Therefore, the entropy will be maximum when the proportion of sample from
# each class will be equal and minimum when only samples for a single class
# is present.
#
# Therefore, one searches to minimize the entropy in each partition.

# %% [markdown]
# In our case, we can see that the entropy in the partition < 42 mm is close to
# 0 meaning that this partition is "pure" and contain a single class while
# the partition >= 42 mm is much higher due to the fact that 2 of the classes
# are still mixed.
#
# Now, we are able to assess the quality of each partition. However, the
# ultimate goal is to evaluate the quality of the split and thus combine both
# measures of entropy to obtain a single statistic.
#
# ### Information gain
#
# This statistic is known as the information gain. It combines the entropy of
# the different partitions to give us a single statistic qualifying the quality
# of a split. The information gain is defined as the difference of the entropy
# before making a split and the sum of the entropies of each partition,
# normalized by the frequencies of class samples on each partition. The goal is
# to maximize the information gain.

#
# As we previously explained, the split mechanism will be repeated several
# times (until we don't have any classification error on the training set). In
# the above example, it corresponds to increasing the `max_depth` parameter.
#

# %% [markdown]
# We predict an Adelie penguin for a value below the threshold which is not
# surprising since this partition was almost pure. In the other case we
# predicted the Gentoo penguin. Indeed, we predict the class the
# most probable.
#
# ## What about decision tree for regression?

# We explained the construction of the decision tree in a classification
# problem. The entropy criterion to split the nodes used the class
# probabilities. Thus, this criterion is not adapted when the target `y` is
# continuous. In this case, we will need specific criterion adapted to
# regression problems.
#

# build some intuitions on the characteristics of decision tree used
# in regression.
#
# ### Decision tree: a non-parametric model

# regression problem instead of a classification problem. Thus, we will try to

# Here, we deal with a regression problem because our target is a continuous
# variable ranging from 2.7 kg to 6.3 kg. From the scatter plot above, we can
# observe that we have a linear relationship between the flipper length
# and the body mass. Longer is the flipper of a penguin, heavier will be the
# penguin.

# For this problem, we would expect the simpler linear model to be able to

# ### The regression criterion
#
# In the previous section, we explained the differences between using decision
# tree in classification or in regression: the predicted value will be the
# most probable class for the classification case while the it will be the mean
# in the case of the regression. The second difference that we already
# mentioned is the criterion. The classification criterion cannot be applied
# in regression setting and we need to use a specific set of criterion.
#
# One of the criterion that can be used in regression is the mean squared
# error. In this case, we will compute this criterion in each partition
# as in the case of the entropy and select the split leading to the best
# improvement (i.e. information gain).

# ### Effect of the `max_depth` parameter
#
# In decision tree, the most important parameter to get a trade-off between
# under-fitting and over-fitting is the `max_depth` parameter. Let's build
# a shallow tree (for both classification and regression) and a deeper tree.

tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=max_depth)
tree_reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=max_depth)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(10, 5))
plot_decision_function(X_train_clf, y_train_clf, tree_clf, ax=axs[0])
plot_regression_model(X_train_reg, y_train_reg, tree_reg, ax=axs[1])
_ = fig.suptitle(f"Shallow tree with a max-depth of {max_depth}")


# %%
max_depth = 30
tree_clf.set_params(max_depth=max_depth)
tree_reg.set_params(max_depth=max_depth)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(10, 5))
plot_decision_function(X_train_clf, y_train_clf, tree_clf, ax=axs[0])

_ = fig.suptitle(f"Deep tree with a max-depth of {max_depth}")

# %% [markdown]
# In both classification and regression setting, we can observe that increasing
# the depth will make the tree model more expressive. However, a tree which is
# too deep will overfit the training data, creating partitions which will only
# be correct for "outliers". The `max_depth` is one of the parameter that one
# would like to optimize via cross-validation and a grid-search.
