# # The penguins datasets
#
# In this notebook, we make a quick presentation of the
# [Palmer penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
# dataset. We use this dataset for both classification and regression
# problems by selecting a subset of the features to make our explanations
# intuitive.
#
# ## Classification dataset
#
# We will use this dataset in classification setting to predict the penguins'
# species from anatomical information.
#
# Each penguin is from one of the three following species: Adelie, Gentoo, and
# Chinstrap. See the illustration below depicting the three different penguin
# species:
#

#
# This problem is a classification problem since the target is categorical.
# We will limit our input data to a subset of the original features
# to simplify our explanations when presenting the decision tree algorithm.
# Indeed, we will use features based on penguins' culmen measurement. You can
# learn more about the penguins' culmen with the illustration below:
#
# ![Image of culmen](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)
#
# We will start by loading this subset of the dataset.

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_classification.csv")

culmen_columns = ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]
target_column = "Species"

# %% [markdown]
# Let's check the dataset more into details.

# %%
penguins.head()

# %% [markdown]
# Since that we have few samples, we can check a scatter plot to observe the
# samples distribution.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

pairplot_figure = sns.pairplot(penguins, hue="Species")
pairplot_figure.fig.set_size_inches(9, 6.5)

# %% [markdown]
# First let's check the feature distributions by looking at the diagonal plots
# of the pairplot. We can deduce the following intuitions:
#
# * The Adelie species can be differentiated from the Gentoo and Chinstrap
#   species depending on the culmen length;
# * The Gentoo species can be differentiated from the Adelie and Chinstrap
#   species depending on the culmen depth.
#
# ## Regression dataset
#
# In a regression setting, the target is a continuous variable instead of
# categories. Here, we use two features of the dataset to make such a problem:
# the flipper length will be used as data and the body mass will be the target.
# In short, we want to predict the body mass using the flipper length.
#
# We will load the dataset and visualize the relationship between the flipper
# length and the body mass of penguins.

# %%
penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")

feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_column = "Body Mass (g)"

# %%
_ = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=feature_name, y=target_column)

# %% [markdown]
# Here, we deal with a regression problem because our target is a continuous
# variable ranging from 2.7 kg to 6.3 kg. From the scatter plot above, we
# observe that we have a linear relationship between the flipper length
# and the body mass. The longer the flipper of a penguin, the heavier the
# penguin.
