# # üìù Exercise M5.01
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed how a tree with a depth of 1 level was
# working. The aim of this exercise is to repeat part of the previous
# experiment for a depth with 2 levels to show how the process of partitioning
# is repeated over time.
#
# Before to start, we will:
#
# * load the dataset;
# * split the dataset into training and testing dataset;
# * define the function to show the classification decision function.
