# # üìù Exercise M5.02
#
# The aim of this exercise is to find out whether a decision tree
# model is able to extrapolate.
#
# By extrapolation, we refer to values predicted by a model outside of the
# range of feature values seen during the training.
#
# We will first load the regression data.

import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")

data_columns = ["Flipper Length (mm)"]
target_column = "Body Mass (g)"

data_train, target_train = penguins[data_columns], penguins[target_column]

# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.

# First, create two models, a linear regression model and a decision tree
# regression model, and fit them on the training data. Limit the depth at
# 3 levels for the decision tree.

# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Create a testing dataset, ranging from the minimum to the maximum of the
# flipper length of the training dataset. Get the predictions of each model
# using this test dataset.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Create a scatter plot containing the training samples and superimpose the
# predictions of both model on the top.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Now, we will check the extrapolation capabilities of each model. Create a
# dataset containing the value of your previous dataset. Besides, add values
# below and above the minimum and the maximum of the flipper length seen
# during training.

# %%
# Write your code here.

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, make predictions with both models on this new testing set. Repeat
# the plotting of the previous exercise.

# Write your code here.
