# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise M5.01
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed how a tree with a depth of 1 level was
# working. The aim of this exercise is to repeat part of the previous
# experiment for a depth with 2 levels to show how the process of partitioning
# is repeated over time.
#
# Before to start, we will:
#
# * load the dataset;
# * split the dataset into training and testing dataset;
# * define the function to show the classification decision function.

# Create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 levels and fit
# the training data. Once this classifier trained, plot the data and the
# decision boundary to see the benefit of increasing the depth. To plot the
# decision boundary, you should import the class `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`
# from the module `sklearn.inspection` as shown in the previous course notebook.

# The resulting tree has 7 nodes: 3 of them are "split nodes" and 4
# are "leaf nodes" (or simply "leaves"), organized in 2 levels.
# We see that the second tree level used the "Culmen Length" to make
# two new decisions. Qualitatively, we saw that such a simple tree was enough
# to classify the penguins' species.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# At this stage, we have the intuition that a decision tree is built by
# successively partitioning the feature space, considering one feature at a
# time.
#
# We predict an Adelie penguin if the feature value is below the threshold,
# which is not surprising since this partition was almost pure. If the feature
# value is above the threshold, we predict the Gentoo penguin, the class that
# is most probable.
