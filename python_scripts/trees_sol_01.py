# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise M5.01
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed how a tree with a depth of 1 level was
# working. The aim of this exercise is to repeat part of the previous experiment
# for a depth with 2 levels to show how the process of partitioning is repeated
# over time.
#
# Before to start, we will:
#
# * load the dataset;
# * split the dataset into training and testing dataset;
# * define the function to show the classification decision function.

# Create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 levels and fit the
# training data. Once this classifier trained, plot the data and the decision
# boundary to see the benefit of increasing the depth. To plot the decision
# boundary, you should import the class `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` from the
# module `sklearn.inspection` as shown in the previous course notebook.

# The resulting tree has 7 nodes: 3 of them are "split nodes" and 4 are "leaf
# nodes" (or simply "leaves"), organized in 2 levels. We see that the second
# tree level used the "Culmen Length" to make two new decisions. Qualitatively,
# we saw that such a simple tree was enough to classify the penguins' species.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# At this stage, we have the intuition that a decision tree is built by
# successively partitioning the feature space, considering one feature at a
# time.
#
# We predict an Adelie penguin if the feature value is below the threshold,
# which is not surprising since this partition was almost pure. If the feature
# value is above the threshold, we predict the Gentoo penguin, the class that is
# most probable.
#
# ## (Estimated) predicted probabilities in multi-class problems
#
# For those interested, one can further try to visualize the output of
# `predict_proba` for a multiclass problem using `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`,
# except that For a K-class problem, you will have K probability outputs for
# each data point. Visualizing all these on a single plot can quickly become
# tricky to interpret. It is then common to instead produce K separate plots,
# one for each class, in a one-vs-rest (or one-vs-all) fashion.
#
# For example, in the plot below, the first plot on the left shows in red the
# certainty on classifying a data point as belonging to the "Adelie" class. In
# the same plot, the blue color represents the certainty of **not** belonging to
# the "Adelie" class. The same logic applies to the other plots in the figure.
