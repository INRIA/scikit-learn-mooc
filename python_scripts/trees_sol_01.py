# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise M5.01
#
# In the previous notebook, we showed how a tree with 1 level depth works. The
# aim of this exercise is to repeat part of the previous experiment for a tree
# with 2 levels depth to show how such parameter affects the feature space
# partitioning.
#
# We first load the penguins dataset and split it into a training and a testing
# sets:

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_classification.csv")
culmen_columns = ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]
target_column = "Species"

# %% [markdown]
# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

# %%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data, target = penguins[culmen_columns], penguins[target_column]
data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, random_state=0
)

# %% [markdown]
# Create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 levels and fit the
# training data.

# %%
# solution
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
tree.fit(data_train, target_train)

# %% [markdown]
# Now plot the data and the decision boundary of the trained classifier to see
# the effect of increasing the depth of the tree.
#
# Hint: Use the class `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` from the module
# `sklearn.inspection` as shown in previous course notebooks.
#
# ```{warning}
# At this time, it is not possible to use `response_method="predict_proba"` for
# multiclass problems on a single plot. This is a planned feature for a future
# version of scikit-learn. In the mean time, you can use
# `response_method="predict"` instead.

# The resulting tree has 7 nodes: 3 of them are "split nodes" and 4 are "leaf
# nodes" (or simply "leaves"), organized in 2 levels. We see that the second
# tree level used the "Culmen Length" to make two new decisions. Qualitatively,
# we saw that such a simple tree was enough to classify the penguins' species.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# At this stage, we have the intuition that a decision tree is built by
# successively partitioning the feature space, considering one feature at a
# time.
#
# We predict an Adelie penguin if the feature value is below the threshold,
# which is not surprising since this partition was almost pure. If the feature
# value is above the threshold, we predict the Gentoo penguin, the class that is
# most probable.
#
# ## (Estimated) predicted probabilities in multi-class problems
#
# For those interested, one can further try to visualize the output of
# `predict_proba` for a multiclass problem using `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`,
# except that for a K-class problem you have K probability outputs for each
# data point. Visualizing all these on a single plot can quickly become tricky
# to interpret. It is then common to instead produce K separate plots, one for
# each class, in a one-vs-rest (or one-vs-all) fashion. This can be achieved by
# calling `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` several times, once for each class, and
# passing the `class_of_interest` parameter to the function.
#
# For example, in the plot below, the first plot on the left shows the
# certainty of classifying a data point as belonging to the "Adelie" class. The
# darker the color, the more certain the model is that a given point in the
# feature space belongs to a given class. The same logic applies to the other
# plots in the figure.

# You may notice that we do not use a diverging colormap (2 color gradients with
# white in the middle). Indeed, in a multiclass setting, 0.5 is not a
# meaningful value, hence using white as the center of the colormap is not
# appropriate. Instead, we use a sequential colormap, where the color intensity
# indicates the certainty of the classification. The darker the color, the more
# certain the model is that a given point in the feature space belongs to a
# given class.
