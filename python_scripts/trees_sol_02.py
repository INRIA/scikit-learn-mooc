# # ðŸ“ƒ Solution for Exercise M5.02
#
# The aim of this exercise is to find out whether a decision tree
# model is able to extrapolate.
#
# By extrapolation, we refer to values predicted by a model outside of the
# range of feature values seen during the training.
#
# We will first load the regression data.

# %%
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")

feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data_train, target_train = penguins[[feature_name]], penguins[target_name]

# First, create two models, a linear regression model and a decision tree
# regression model, and fit them on the training data. Limit the depth at
# 3 levels for the decision tree.

# The predictions that we got were within the range of feature values seen
# during training. In some sense, we observe the capabilities of our model to
# interpolate.

# %% [markdown]
# Now, we will check the extrapolation capabilities of each model. Create a
# dataset containing a broader range of values than your previous dataset,
# in other words, add values below and above the minimum and the maximum of
# the flipper length seen during training.

# The linear model will extrapolate using the fitted model for flipper lengths
# < 175 mm and > 235 mm. In fact, we are using the model parametrization to
# make this predictions.
#
# As mentioned, decision trees are non-parametric models and we observe that
# they cannot extrapolate. For flipper lengths below the minimum, the mass of
# the penguin in the training data with the shortest flipper length will always
# be predicted. Similarly, for flipper lengths above the maximum, the mass of
# the penguin in the training data with the longest flipper will always be
# predicted.
