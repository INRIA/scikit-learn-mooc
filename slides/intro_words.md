Hi,

Welcome to the Machine-learning with scikit-learn course. The goal of
this course is to teach you practical aspects of machine learning. It
focuses on tabular data, given that such data is often encountered in the
industry. The course is light on maths, and focuses on practical aspects,
not only about pure machine learning, but also about the basics of data
preparation and visualization for machine learning. Most of the content is
centered on executable Python code that teaches how to analyse the data,
with tools such as scikit-learn.

Our goal is to be didactic. If you know Python programming and basic
numerics, you should be able to follow along. We hope that this course
will help introduce more people to machine learning.
